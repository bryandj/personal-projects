## Welcome to my repository of personal data science(ish) mini-projects.

These activities were completely independent from any of my previous industry or academic sources of funding or research ventures. In these fun, small, weekend projects, I explored and analyzed various sources of data through a range of machine learning algorithms.

The most complete tutorial is contained in the [**Fantasy-Golf-Forecasting**](https://github.com/cschoeny/personal-projects/tree/master/Fantasy-Golf-Forecasting) project -- check it out!

My personal favorite mini-project, and the most ambitious, is [**UFC-Forecasting**](https://github.com/cschoeny/personal-projects/tree/master/UFC-Forecasting).

The [**FIFA Dataset Player Exploration**](https://github.com/cschoeny/personal-projects/tree/master/FIFA-2018) is light on the technical side of things, but it contains some fun exploratory data analysis and charts.


I created this small portfolio when I was learning the basics of data science. The process helped me acquire the skills needed to land an awesome full-time position as a Data Scientist with [Fair](http://www.fair.com). As a result, I am currently working on amazing projects; however, they are obviously not available to share publicly.
