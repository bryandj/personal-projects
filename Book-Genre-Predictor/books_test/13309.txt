subtraction, multiplication, and division, the signs that you have been using
and the ways of working out problems, will be very useful to you in this study.
There are two things the introduction of which really makes all the difference
between arithmetic and algebra. One of these is the use of letters to represent
numbers, and you will see in the following exercises that this change makes the
solution of problems much easier.
Exercise I.
Illustrative Example. The sum of two numbers is 60, and the greater is four
times the less. What are the numbers?
Solution.
Let x= the less number;
then 4x= the greater number,
and 4x + x=60,
or 5x=60;
therefore x=12,
and 4x=48. The numbers are 12 and 48.

Solution.
Let x= the less number;
then 5x= the greater number,
and 5x - x=48,
or 4x=48;
therefore x=12,
and 5x=60.
The numbers are 12 and 60.

SUBTRACTION.
3. ILLUS. 1. A man sold a horse for $225 and gained $75.
What did the horse cost?
ILLUS. 2. A farmer sold a sheep for m dollars and gained
y dollars. What did the sheep cost? Ans. m - y dollars.
Subtraction is expressed by the sign minus (-).
ILLUS. 3. A man started at a certain point and traveled
north 15 miles, then south 30 miles, then north 20 miles,
then north 5 miles, then south 6 miles. How far is he
from where he started and in which direction?
ILLUS. 4. A man started at a certain point and traveled east x
miles, then west b miles, then east m miles, then east y
miles, then west z miles. How far is he from where he started?
We find a difficulty in solving this last example, because we do not know
just how large x, b, m, y, and z are with reference to each other. This is only one
example of a large class of problems which may arise, in which we find direction
east and west, north and south; space before and behind, to the right and to the
left, above and below; time past and future; money gained and lost; everywhere
these opposite relations. This relation of oppositeness must be expressed in
some way in our representation of numbers.
In algebra, therefore, numbers are considered as increasing from zero in
opposite directions. Those in one direction are called Positive Numbers (or +
numbers); those in the other direction Negative Numbers (or - numbers).
In Illus. 4, if we call direction east positive, then direction west will be negative,
and the respective distances that the man traveled will be +x, -b, +m, +y,
and -z. Combining these, the answer to the problem becomes x-b+m+y-z.
If the same analysis be applied to Illus. 3, we get 15 - 30 + 20 + 5 - 6 = +4, or
4 miles north of starting-point.
The minus sign before a single number makes the number negative,
and shows that the number has a subtractive relation to any
other to which it may be united, and that it will diminish that number
by its value. It shows a relation rather than an operation.
Negative numbers are the second of the two things referred to on page 7, the
introduction of which makes all the difference between arithmetic and algebra.
NOTE.—Negative numbers are usually spoken of as less than zero, because
they are used to represent losses. To illustrate: suppose a man’s money affairs
be such that his debts just equal his assets, we say that he is worth nothing.
Suppose now that the sum of his debts is $1000 greater than his total assets.
He is worse off than by the first supposition, and we say that he is worth less
than nothing. We should represent his property by -1000 (dollars).

These two are read “x second power,” or “x square,” and “x third power,”
or “x cube,” and are called powers of x.
A power is a product of like factors.
The 2 and the 3 are called the exponents of the power.
An exponent is a number expressed at the right and a little above another
number to show how many times it is taken as a factor.
Multiplication is expressed (1) by signs, i.e. the dot and the cross;
(2) by writing the factors successively; (3) by exponent.
The last two are the more common methods.

In arithmetic you learned that multiplication is the addition of equal numbers,
that the multiplicand expresses one of those equal numbers, and the multiplier
the number of them. In algebra we have negative as well as positive
numbers. Let us see the effect of this in multiplication. We have four possible
cases.
37
1. Multiplication of a plus number by a plus number.
+7
ILLUS. +4 This must mean four sevens, or 28.
2. Multiplication of a minus number by a plus number.
-7
ILLUS. +4 This must mean four minus-sevens, or -28.
3. Multiplication of a plus number by a minus number.
+7
ILLUS. -4
This must mean the opposite of what +4 meant as a
multiplier. Plus four meant add, minus four must mean subtract. Subtracting
four sevens gives -28.
4. Multiplication of a minus number by a minus number.
-7
ILLUS. -4 This must mean subtract four minus-sevens, or 28.
ILLUS. 3. +b -b +b -b
+a +a -a -a

To multiply a monomial by a monomial, multiply the coefficients together for

From the relation of the dividend, divisor, and quotient, and the law for
signs in multiplication, obtain the quotients in Illus. 2.
To divide a monomial by a monomial, divide the coefficient of the dividend
by the coefficient of the divisor for the coefficient of the quotient, subtract the
exponent of each letter in the divisor from the exponent of the same letter in the
dividend for the exponent of that letter in the quotient: if dividend and divisor
have like signs, give the quotient the plus sign; if unlike, the minus sign.

Why stop the work at the point given? What is the complete quotient?
Is the dividend exactly divisible by the divisor? When is one number exactly
divisible by another?
To divide a polynomial by a polynomial, arrange the terms of the dividend,
and divisor similarly, divide the first term of the dividend by the first term of the
divisor for the first term of the quotient, multiply the divisor by the quotient and
subtract the product from the dividend; divide the first term of the remainder
by the first term of the divisor for the next term of the quotient, multiply and
subtract as before; continue this work of dividing, multiplying, and subtracting
until there is no remainder or until the first term of the remainder is not divisible
by the first term of the divisor.

To find the square root of a polynomial, arrange the terms with reference to
the powers of some number; take the square root of the first term of the polynomial
for the first term of the root, and subtract its square from the polynomial;
divide the first term of the remainder by twice the root found for the next term of
the root, and add the quotient to the trial divisor; multiply the complete divisor
by the second term of the root, and subtract the product from the remainder.
If there is still a remainder, consider the root already found as one term, and
proceed as before.

To find the cube root of a polynomial, arrange the terms with reference to
the powers of some number; take the cube root of the first term for the first
term of the root, and subtract its cube from the polynomial; take three times
the square of the root already found for a trial divisor, divide the first term of
the remainder by it, and write the quotient for the next term of the root; add
to the trial divisor three times the product of the first term by the second and
the square of the second; multiply the complete divisor by the second term of
the root, and subtract the product from the remainder. If there are other terms
remaining, consider the root already found as one term, and proceed as before.

To find a fraction equivalent to a given mixed number, multiply the entire
part by the denominator of the fraction, add, the numerator if the sign of the
76
fraction be plus, subtract it if the sign be minus, and write the result over the
denominator.
How may an entire number be changed to a fraction having a given denominator?
ILLUS. 3. Change a

c × ab = abc
d × ab abd
x × d = xd
ab × d abd
To change fractions to equivalent fractions having a common denominator,
multiply the terms of each fraction by such a number as will make its denominator
equal to the L.C.M. of the given denominators.

.
In case the terms of the fraction are polynomials, notice that the change in
sign affects every term of the numerator or denominator.
ILLUS. 2.

=
b - a
y - x

An equation is an expression of the equality of two numbers. The parts of
the expression separated by the sign of equality are called the members of the
equation.
The last letters of the alphabet are used to represent unknown numbers, and
known numbers are represented by figures or by the first letters of the alphabet.
44. ILLUS. 1. 5x + 20 = 105.
5x = 85.

ILLUS. 4. 7x = 49.
x = 7.
Any changes may be made in an equation which do not destroy
the equality of the members.
Name some of the ways in which such changes may be made.
45. ILLUS. 1. x + b = a. Subtracting b from each member, x = a - b.
ILLUS. 2. x - b = c. Adding b to each member, x = c + b.
In each of these illustrations b has been transposed (changed over) from the
first to the second member, and in each case its sign has been changed. Hence,
Any term may be transposed from one member of an equation to
the other provided its sign be changed.

15x + 9 - 24 + 32x + 12x = 372 - 36 + 20x
Transposing, 15x + 32x + 12x - 20x = 372 - 36 - 9 + 24
39x = 351
x = 9
To solve an equation, clear of fractions if necessary, transpose the terms
containing the unknown number to one member and the known terms to the
other, unite the terms, and divide both members by the coefficient of the unknown
number.

A quadratic equation is an equation in which, the highest power of the
unknown number is a square. It is called an equation of the second degree.
If it contains only the second power of the unknown number (Illus. 1), it is
called a pure quadratic equation. If it contains both the first and second
powers of the unknown number (Illus. 2), it is called an affected quadratic
equation.

This equation will be satisfied if either factor is equal to zero. Placing each
factor in turn equal to zero, and solving,
x-5 = 0, x-1 = 0,
x = 5; x = 1.
Ans. x = 5 or 1.

The above method of solving affected quadratic equations is the simplest of
three methods commonly used, and will not solve all possible cases; the method
given for solving simultaneous equations is only one of three known methods;
the cases in factoring are less than half of those usually taken. In fact, we
have made only a beginning in the subject of algebra; much more lies ahead
along the lines which we have been following. Can you grasp more clearly the
conditions given in any problem presented to you, and see more definitely just
what is required, than when you began this study? Do you possess greater ability
to think out problems? Has the use of letters to represent numbers made you
think more exactly what is to be done, and what the operations mean? If so,
your knowledge of numbers is broader, and you already know that
Algebra is the knowledge which has for its object general truths
about numbers.
