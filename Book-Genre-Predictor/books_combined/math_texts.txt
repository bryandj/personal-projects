THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY
LECTURE I
SPACE AND TIME IN PRE-RELATIVITY
PHYSICS
The theory of relativity is intimately connected with the theory
of space and time. I shall therefore begin with a brief investigation
of the origin of our ideas of space and time, although in
doing so I know that I introduce a controversial subject. The
object of all science, whether natural science or psychology, is
to co-ordinate our experiences and to bring them into a logical
system. How are our customary ideas of space and time related
to the character of our experiences?
The experiences of an individual appear to us arranged in a
series of events; in this series the single events which we remember
appear to be ordered according to the criterion of “earlier”
and “later,” which cannot be analysed further. There exists,
therefore, for the individual, an I-time, or subjective time. This
in itself is not measurable. I can, indeed, associate numbers with
the events, in such a way that a greater number is associated
with the later event than with an earlier one; but the nature of
this association may be quite arbitrary. This association I can
define by means of a clock by comparing the order of events furnished
by the clock with the order of the given series of events.
We understand by a clock something which provides a series of
events which can be counted, and which has other properties of
which we shall speak later.

THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 2
By the aid of speech different individuals can, to a certain
extent, compare their experiences. In this way it is shown that
certain sense perceptions of different individuals correspond to
each other, while for other sense perceptions no such correspondence
can be established. We are accustomed to regard as real
those sense perceptions which are common to different individuals,
and which therefore are, in a measure, impersonal. The natural
sciences, and in particular, the most fundamental of them,
physics, deal with such sense perceptions. The conception of
physical bodies, in particular of rigid bodies, is a relatively constant
complex of such sense perceptions. A clock is also a body,
or a system, in the same sense, with the additional property that
the series of events which it counts is formed of elements all of
which can be regarded as equal.
The only justification for our concepts and system of concepts
is that they serve to represent the complex of our experiences;
beyond this they have no legitimacy. I am convinced that
the philosophers have had a harmful effect upon the progress
of scientific thinking in removing certain fundamental concepts
from the domain of empiricism, where they are under our control,
to the intangible heights of the a priori. For even if it should
appear that the universe of ideas cannot be deduced from experience
by logical means, but is, in a sense, a creation of the
human mind, without which no science is possible, nevertheless
this universe of ideas is just as little independent of the nature
of our experiences as clothes are of the form of the human body.
This is particularly true of our concepts of time and space, which
physicists have been obliged by the facts to bring down from the
Olympus of the a priori in order to adjust them and put them
in a serviceable condition.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 3
We now come to our concepts and judgments of space. It
is essential here also to pay strict attention to the relation of
experience to our concepts. It seems to me that Poincar´e clearly
recognized the truth in the account he gave in his book, “La
Science et l’Hypothese.” Among all the changes which we can
perceive in a rigid body those are marked by their simplicity
which can be made reversibly by an arbitrary motion of the
body; Poincar´e calls these, changes in position. By means of
simple changes in position we can bring two bodies into contact.
The theorems of congruence, fundamental in geometry, have to
do with the laws that govern such changes in position. For the
concept of space the following seems essential. We can form new
bodies by bringing bodies B, C, . . . up to body A; we say that
we continue body A. We can continue body A in such a way that
it comes into contact with any other body, X. The ensemble of
all continuations of body A we can designate as the “space of
the body A.” Then it is true that all bodies are in the “space of
the (arbitrarily chosen) body A.” In this sense we cannot speak
of space in the abstract, but only of the “space belonging to a
body A.” The earth’s crust plays such a dominant rˆole in our
daily life in judging the relative positions of bodies that it has
led to an abstract conception of space which certainly cannot be
defended. In order to free ourselves from this fatal error we shall
speak only of “bodies of reference,” or “space of reference.” It
was only through the theory of general relativity that refinement
of these concepts became necessary, as we shall see later.
I shall not go into detail concerning those properties of the
space of reference which lead to our conceiving points as elements
of space, and space as a continuum. Nor shall I attempt
to analyse further the properties of space which justify the con-
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 4
ception of continuous series of points, or lines. If these concepts
are assumed, together with their relation to the solid bodies of
experience, then it is easy to say what we mean by the threedimensionality
of space; to each point three numbers, x1, x2, x3
(co-ordinates), may be associated, in such a way that this association
is uniquely reciprocal, and that x1, x2 and x3 vary continuously
when the point describes a continuous series of points
(a line).
It is assumed in pre-relativity physics that the laws of the
orientation of ideal rigid bodies are consistent with Euclidean
geometry. What this means may be expressed as follows: Two
points marked on a rigid body form an interval. Such an interval
can be oriented at rest, relatively to our space of reference, in
a multiplicity of ways. If, now, the points of this space can
be referred to co-ordinates x1, x2, x3, in such a way that the
differences of the co-ordinates, ?x1, ?x2, ?x3, of the two ends
of the interval furnish the same sum of squares,
s
2 = ?x1
2 + ?x2
2 + ?x3
2
, (1)
for every orientation of the interval, then the space of reference
is called Euclidean, and the co-ordinates Cartesian.*
It is
sufficient, indeed, to make this assumption in the limit for an
infinitely small interval. Involved in this assumption there are
some which are rather less special, to which we must call attention
on account of their fundamental significance. In the first
place, it is assumed that one can move an ideal rigid body in an
arbitrary manner. In the second place, it is assumed that the behaviour
of ideal rigid bodies towards orientation is independent
*This relation must hold for an arbitrary choice of the origin and of the
direction (ratios ?x1 : ?x2 : ?x3) of the interval.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 5
of the material of the bodies and their changes of position, in the
sense that if two intervals can once be brought into coincidence,
they can always and everywhere be brought into coincidence.
Both of these assumptions, which are of fundamental importance
for geometry and especially for physical measurements,
naturally arise from experience; in the theory of general relativity
their validity needs to be assumed only for bodies and spaces
of reference which are infinitely small compared to astronomical
dimensions.
The quantity s we call the length of the interval. In order
that this may be uniquely determined it is necessary to fix arbitrarily
the length of a definite interval; for example, we can put
it equal to 1 (unit of length). Then the lengths of all other intervals
may be determined. If we make the x? linearly dependent
upon a parameter ?,
x? = a? + ?b?,
we obtain a line which has all the properties of the straight
lines of the Euclidean geometry. In particular, it easily follows
that by laying off n times the interval s upon a straight line, an
interval of length n · s is obtained. A length, therefore, means
the result of a measurement carried out along a straight line by
means of a unit measuring rod. It has a significance which is as
independent of the system of co-ordinates as that of a straight
line, as will appear in the sequel.
We come now to a train of thought which plays an analogous
rˆole in the theories of special and general relativity. We ask
the question: besides the Cartesian co-ordinates which we have
used are there other equivalent co-ordinates? An interval has
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 6
a physical meaning which is independent of the choice of coordinates;
and so has the spherical surface which we obtain as
the locus of the end points of all equal intervals that we lay off
from an arbitrary point of our space of reference. If x? as well
as x
0
? (? from 1 to 3) are Cartesian co-ordinates of our space
of reference, then the spherical surface will be expressed in our
two systems of co-ordinates by the equations
X?x?
2 = const. (2)
X?x
0
?
2 = const. (2a)
How must the x
0
? be expressed in terms of the x? in order that
equations (2) and (2a) may be equivalent to each other? Regarding
the x
0
? expressed as functions of the x?, we can write,
by Taylor’s theorem, for small values of the ?x?,
?x
0
? =
X
a
?x0

?xa
?xa +
1
2
X
a,ß
?
2x
0
?
?xa ?xß
?xa ?xß . . . .
If we substitute (2a) in this equation and compare with (1),
we see that the x
0
? must be linear functions of the x?. If we
therefore put
x
0
? = a? +
X
a
b?axa, (3)
or
?x
0
? =
X
a
b?a ?xa, (3a)
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 7
then the equivalence of equations (2) and (2a) is expressed in
the form
X?x
0
?
2 = ?
X?x?
2
(? independent of ?x?). (2b)
It therefore follows that ? must be a constant. If we put ? = 1,
(2b) and (3a) furnish the conditions
X
?
b?ab?ß = daß, (4)
in which daß = 1, or daß = 0, according as a = ß or a 6= ß. The
conditions (4) are called the conditions of orthogonality, and the
transformations (3), (4), linear orthogonal transformations. If
we stipulate that s
2 =
P?x?
2
shall be equal to the square of
the length in every system of co-ordinates, and if we always measure
with the same unit scale, then ? must be equal to 1. Therefore
the linear orthogonal transformations are the only ones by
means of which we can pass from one Cartesian system of coordinates
in our space of reference to another. We see that in
applying such transformations the equations of a straight line
become equations of a straight line. Reversing equations (3a)
by multiplying both sides by b?ß and summing for all the ?’s,
we obtain
X
?
b?ß ?x
0
? =
X
?,a
b?ab?ß ?xa =
X
a
daß ?xa = ?xß. (5)
The same coefficients, b, also determine the inverse substitution
of ?x?. Geometrically, b?a is the cosine of the angle between
the x
0
? axis and the xa axis.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 8
To sum up, we can say that in the Euclidean geometry
there are (in a given space of reference) preferred systems of
co-ordinates, the Cartesian systems, which transform into each
other by linear orthogonal transformations. The distance s between
two points of our space of reference, measured by a measuring
rod, is expressed in such co-ordinates in a particularly
simple manner. The whole of geometry may be founded upon
this conception of distance. In the present treatment, geometry
is related to actual things (rigid bodies), and its theorems are
statements concerning the behaviour of these things, which may
prove to be true or false.
One is ordinarily accustomed to study geometry divorced
from any relation between its concepts and experience. There
are advantages in isolating that which is purely logical and independent
of what is, in principle, incomplete empiricism. This
is satisfactory to the pure mathematician. He is satisfied if he
can deduce his theorems from axioms correctly, that is, without
errors of logic. The question as to whether Euclidean geometry
is true or not does not concern him. But for our purpose it
is necessary to associate the fundamental concepts of geometry
with natural objects; without such an association geometry is
worthless for the physicist. The physicist is concerned with the
question as to whether the theorems of geometry are true or
not. That Euclidean geometry, from this point of view, affirms
something more than the mere deductions derived logically from
definitions may be seen from the following simple consideration.
Between n points of space there are n(n - 1)
2
distances, sµ?;
between these and the 3n co-ordinates we have the relations
sµ?
2 =

x1(µ) - x1(?)
2
+

x2(µ) - x2(?)
2
+ . . .
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 9
From these n(n - 1)
2
equations the 3n co-ordinates may be
eliminated, and from this elimination at least n(n - 1)
2
- 3n
equations in the sµ? will result.* Since the sµ? are measurable
quantities, and by definition are independent of each other, these
relations between the sµ? are not necessary a priori.
From the foregoing it is evident that the equations of transformation
(3), (4) have a fundamental significance in Euclidean
geometry, in that they govern the transformation from one
Cartesian system of co-ordinates to another. The Cartesian
systems of co-ordinates are characterized by the property that
in them the measurable distance between two points, s, is
expressed by the equation
s
2 =
X?x?
2
.
If K(x?) and K0
(x?)
are two Cartesian systems of co-ordinates,
then
X?x?
2 =
X?x
0
?
2
.
The right-hand side is identically equal to the left-hand side
on account of the equations of the linear orthogonal transformation,
and the right-hand side differs from the left-hand side
only in that the x? are replaced by the x
0
?. This is expressed
by the statement that P?x?
2
is an invariant with respect to
linear orthogonal transformations. It is evident that in the Euclidean
geometry only such, and all such, quantities have an
objective significance, independent of the particular choice of
*
In reality there are n(n - 1)
2
- 3n + 6 equations.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 10
the Cartesian co-ordinates, as can be expressed by an invariant
with respect to linear orthogonal transformations. This is
the reason that the theory of invariants, which has to do with
the laws that govern the form of invariants, is so important for
analytical geometry.
As a second example of a geometrical invariant, consider a
volume. This is expressed by
V =
Z Z Z dx1 dx2 dx3.
By means of Jacobi’s theorem we may write
Z Z Z dx0
1 dx0
2 dx0
3 =
Z Z Z ?(x
0
1, x0
2, x0
3)
?(x1, x2, x3)
dx1 dx2 dx3
where the integrand in the last integral is the functional determinant
of the x
0
? with respect to the x?, and this by (3) is equal
to the determinant |bµ?| of the coefficients of substitution, b?a. If
we form the determinant of the dµa from equation (4), we obtain,
by means of the theorem of multiplication of determinants,
1 = |daß| =





X
?
b?ab?ß





= |bµ?|
2
; |bµ?| = ±1. (6)
If we limit ourselves to those transformations which have the determinant
+1,* and only these arise from continuous variations
of the systems of co-ordinates, then V is an invariant.
*There are thus two kinds of Cartesian systems which are designated as
“right-handed” and “left-handed” systems. The difference between these is
familiar to every physicist and engineer. It is interesting to note that these
two kinds of systems cannot be defined geometrically, but only the contrast
between them.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 11
Invariants, however, are not the only forms by means of
which we can give expression to the independence of the particular
choice of the Cartesian co-ordinates. Vectors and tensors
are other forms of expression. Let us express the fact that the
point with the current co-ordinates x? lies upon a straight line.
We have
x? - A? = ?B? (? from 1 to 3).
Without limiting the generality we can put
XB?
2 = 1.
If we multiply the equations by bß? (compare (3a) and (5))
and sum for all the ?’s, we get
x
0
ß - A
0
ß = ?B0
ß,
where we have written
B
0
ß =
X
?
bß?B?; A
0
ß =
X
?
bß?A?.
These are the equations of straight lines with respect to a
second Cartesian system of co-ordinates K0
. They have the
same form as the equations with respect to the original system
of co-ordinates. It is therefore evident that straight lines
have a significance which is independent of the system of coordinates.
Formally, this depends upon the fact that the quantities
(x? - A?) - ?B? are transformed as the components of
an interval, ?x?. The ensemble of three quantities, defined for
every system of Cartesian co-ordinates, and which transform as
the components of an interval, is called a vector. If the three
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 12
components of a vector vanish for one system of Cartesian coordinates,
they vanish for all systems, because the equations of
transformation are homogeneous. We can thus get the meaning
of the concept of a vector without referring to a geometrical representation.
This behaviour of the equations of a straight line
can be expressed by saying that the equation of a straight line
is co-variant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations.
We shall now show briefly that there are geometrical entities
which lead to the concept of tensors. Let P0 be the centre of a
surface of the second degree, P any point on the surface, and
?? the projections of the interval P0P upon the co-ordinate axes.
Then the equation of the surface is
Xaµ??µ?? = 1.
In this, and in analogous cases, we shall omit the sign of summation,
and understand that the summation is to be carried out
for those indices that appear twice. We thus write the equation
of the surface
aµ??µ?? = 1.
The quantities aµ? determine the surface completely, for a given
position of the centre, with respect to the chosen system of
Cartesian co-ordinates. From the known law of transformation
for the ?? (3a) for linear orthogonal transformations, we easily
find the law of transformation for the aµ?:
*
a
0
st = bsµbt ?aµ?.

t = 1 may, by (5), be replaced by
a
0
st bµsb?t ?µ?? = 1, from which the result stated immediately follows.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 13
This transformation is homogeneous and of the first degree in
the aµ?. On account of this transformation, the aµ? are called
components of a tensor of the second rank (the latter on account
of the double index). If all the components, aµ?, of a tensor with
respect to any system of Cartesian co-ordinates vanish, they
vanish with respect to every other Cartesian system. The form
and the position of the surface of the second degree is described
by this tensor (a).
Analytic tensors of higher rank (number of indices) may be
defined. It is possible and advantageous to regard vectors as
tensors of rank 1, and invariants (scalars) as tensors of rank 0.
In this respect, the problem of the theory of invariants may be so
formulated: according to what laws may new tensors be formed
from given tensors? We shall consider these laws now, in order
to be able to apply them later. We shall deal first only with the
properties of tensors with respect to the transformation from
one Cartesian system to another in the same space of reference,
by means of linear orthogonal transformations. As the laws are
wholly independent of the number of dimensions, we shall leave
this number, n, indefinite at first.
Definition. If a figure is defined with respect to every system
of Cartesian co-ordinates in a space of reference of n dimensions
by the n
a numbers Aµ?? · · · (a = number of indices), then
these numbers are the components of a tensor of rank a if the
transformation law is
A

0?
0
· · · = bµ0µb?
0?b?
0? . . . Aµ?? · · ·
. (7)
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 14
Remark. From this definition it follows that
Aµ?? · · · = BµC?D? . . . (8)
is an invariant, provided that (B), (C), (D) . . . are vectors.
Conversely, the tensor character of (A) may be inferred, if it
is known that the expression (8) leads to an invariant for an
arbitrary choice of the vectors (B), (C), etc.
Addition and Subtraction. By addition and subtraction of
the corresponding components of tensors of the same rank, a
tensor of equal rank results:
Aµ?? · · · ± Bµ?? · · · = Cµ?? · · ·
. (9)
The proof follows from the definition of a tensor given above.
Multiplication. From a tensor of rank a and a tensor of
rank ß we may obtain a tensor of rank a + ß by multiplying all
the components of the first tensor by all the components of the
second tensor:
Tµ?? · · · aß · · · = Aµ?? · · · Baß? · · ·
. (10)
Contraction. A tensor of rank a - 2 may be obtained from
one of rank a by putting two definite indices equal to each other
and then summing for this single index:
T? · · · = Aµµ? · · ·(= X
µ
Aµµ? · · ·). (11)
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 15
The proof is
A
0
µµ? · · · = bµabµßb?? . . . Aaß? · · · = daßb?? . . . Aaß? · · ·
= b?? . . . Aaa? · · ·
.
In addition to these elementary rules of operation there is
also the formation of tensors by differentiation (“erweiterung”):
Tµ?? · · · a =
?Aµ?? · · ·
?xa
. (12)
New tensors, in respect to linear orthogonal transformations,
may be formed from tensors according to these rules of operation.
Symmetrical Properties of Tensors. Tensors are called symmetrical
or skew-symmetrical in respect to two of their indices,
µ and ?, if both the components which result from interchanging
the indices µ and ? are equal to each other or equal with
opposite signs.
Condition for symmetry: Aµ?? = A?µ?.
Condition for skew-symmetry: Aµ?? = -A?µ?.
Theorem. The character of symmetry or skew-symmetry
exists independently of the choice of co-ordinates, and in this
lies its importance. The proof follows from the equation defining
tensors.
Special Tensors.
I. The quantities d?s (4) are tensor components (fundamental
tensor).
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 16
Proof. If in the right-hand side of the equation of transformation
A0
µ? = bµab?ßAaß, we substitute for Aaß the quantities
daß (which are equal to 1 or 0 according as a = ß or a 6= ß),
we get
A
0
µ? = bµab?a = dµ?.
The justification for the last sign of equality becomes evident if
one applies (4) to the inverse substitution (5).
II. There is a tensor (dµ?? · · ·) skew-symmetrical with respect
to all pairs of indices, whose rank is equal to the number of
dimensions, n, and whose components are equal to +1 or -1
according as µ ? ? . . . is an even or odd permutation of 1 2 3 . . . .
The proof follows with the aid of the theorem proved above
|b?s| = 1.
These few simple theorems form the apparatus from the
theory of invariants for building the equations of pre-relativity
physics and the theory of special relativity.
We have seen that in pre-relativity physics, in order to specify
relations in space, a body of reference, or a space of reference,
is required, and, in addition, a Cartesian system of co-ordinates.
We can fuse both these concepts into a single one by thinking
of a Cartesian system of co-ordinates as a cubical frame-work
formed of rods each of unit length. The co-ordinates of the lattice
points of this frame are integral numbers. It follows from
the fundamental relation
s
2 = ?x1
2 + ?x2
2 + ?x3
2
(13)
that the members of such a space-lattice are all of unit length.
To specify relations in time, we require in addition a standard
clock placed at the origin of our Cartesian system of co-ordinates
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS 17
or frame of reference. If an event takes place anywhere we can
assign to it three co-ordinates, x?, and a time t, as soon as
we have specified the time of the clock at the origin which is
simultaneous with the event. We therefore give an objective significance
to the statement of the simultaneity of distant events,
while previously we have been concerned only with the simultaneity
of two experiences of an individual. The time so specified
is at all events independent of the position of the system of coordinates
in our space of reference, and is therefore an invariant
with respect to the transformation (3).
It is postulated that the system of equations expressing the
laws of pre-relativity physics is co-variant with respect to the
transformation (3), as are the relations of Euclidean geometry.
The isotropy and homogeneity of space is expressed in this way.*
We shall now consider some of the more important equations of
physics from this point of view.
The equations of motion of a material particle are
m
d
2x?
dt2
= X?; (14)
(dx?) is a vector; dt, and therefore also 1
dt, an invariant; thus
*The laws of physics could be expressed, even in case there were a
unique direction in space, in such a way as to be co-variant with respect
to the transformation (3); but such an expression would in this case be
unsuitable. If there were a unique direction in space it would simplify the
description of natural phenomena to orient the system of co-ordinates in
a definite way in this direction. But if, on the other hand, there is no
unique direction in space it is not logical to formulate the laws of nature
in such a way as to conceal the equivalence of systems of co-ordinates that
are oriented differently. We shall meet with this point of view again in the
theories of special and general relativity.

is a vector; in the same way it may be shown that

is a vector. In general, the operation of differentiation
with respect to time does not alter the tensor character. Since

tensor of rank 1 (by the theorem of the multiplication of tensors).
If the force (X?) has a vector character, the same holds for

therefore valid in every other system of Cartesian co-ordinates
in the space of reference. In the case where the forces are conservative
we can easily recognize the vector character of (X?).
For a potential energy, F, exists, which depends only upon the
mutual distances of the particles, and is therefore an invariant.
The vector character of the force, X? = -

It is evident in this way that the moment of a vector is not a

there are not nine, but only three independent equations of
this system. The possibility of replacing skew-symmetrical tensors
of the second rank in space of three dimensions by vectors
depends upon the formation of the vector

THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 20
If we multiply the skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2 by the
special skew-symmetrical tensor d introduced above, and contract
twice, a vector results whose components are numerically
equal to those of the tensor. These are the so-called axial vectors
which transform differently, from a right-handed system to
a left-handed system, from the ?x?. There is a gain in picturesqueness
in regarding a skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2
as a vector in space of three dimensions, but it does not represent
the exact nature of the corresponding quantity so well as
considering it a tensor.
We consider next the equations of motion of a continuous
medium. Let ? be the density, u? the velocity components considered
as functions of the co-ordinates and the time, X? the
volume forces per unit of mass, and p?s the stresses upon a surface
perpendicular to the s-axis in the direction of increasing x?.
Then the equations of motion are, by Newton’s law,

results from contraction in the indices s, t . The vector character
of the second term on the right is obvious. In order that the first
term on the right may also be a vector it is necessary for p?s to be
a tensor. Then by differentiation and contraction ?p?s

results,

is proved in mechanics by integrating this equation over an infinitely
small tetrahedron. It is also proved there, by application
of the theorem of moments to an infinitely small parallelopipedon,
that p?s = ps?, and hence that the tensor of the stress is
a symmetrical tensor. From what has been said it follows that,
with the aid of the rules given above, the equation is co-variant
with respect to orthogonal transformations in space (rotational
transformations); and the rules according to which the quantities
in the equation must be transformed in order that the
equation may be co-variant also become evident.
The co-variance of the equation of continuity,
??
?t +
?(?u?)
?x?

requires, from the foregoing, no particular discussion.
We shall also test for co-variance the equations which express
the dependence of the stress components upon the properties of
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 22
the matter, and set up these equations for the case of a compressible
viscous fluid with the aid of the conditions of co-variance.
If we neglect the viscosity, the pressure, p, will be a scalar, and
will depend only upon the density and the temperature of the
fluid. The contribution to the stress tensor is then evidently
pdµ?
in which dµ? is the special symmetrical tensor. This term will
also be present in the case of a viscous fluid. But in this case
there will also be pressure terms, which depend upon the space
derivatives of the u?. We shall assume that this dependence is a
linear one. Since these terms must be symmetrical tensors, the
only ones which enter will be

LECTURE II
THE THEORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY
The previous considerations concerning the configuration of
rigid bodies have been founded, irrespective of the assumption
as to the validity of the Euclidean geometry, upon the hypothesis
that all directions in space, or all configurations of Cartesian systems
of co-ordinates, are physically equivalent. We may express
this as the “principle of relativity with respect to direction,” and
it has been shown how equations (laws of nature) may be found,
in accord with this principle, by the aid of the calculus of tensors.
We now inquire whether there is a relativity with respect
to the state of motion of the space of reference; in other words,
whether there are spaces of reference in motion relatively to each
other which are physically equivalent. From the standpoint of
mechanics it appears that equivalent spaces of reference do exist.
For experiments upon the earth tell us nothing of the fact
that we are moving about the sun with a velocity of approximately
30 kilometres a second. On the other hand, this physical
equivalence does not seem to hold for spaces of reference in arbitrary
motion; for mechanical effects do not seem to be subject
to the same laws in a jolting railway train as in one moving with
uniform velocity; the rotation of the earth must be considered
in writing down the equations of motion relatively to the earth.
It appears, therefore, as if there were Cartesian systems of coordinates,
the so-called inertial systems, with reference to which
the laws of mechanics (more generally the laws of physics) are
expressed in the simplest form. We may infer the validity of
the following theorem: If K is an inertial system, then every
25
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 26
other system K0 which moves uniformly and without rotation
relatively to K, is also an inertial system; the laws of nature are
in concordance for all inertial systems. This statement we shall
call the “principle of special relativity.” We shall draw certain
conclusions from this principle of “relativity of translation” just
as we have already done for relativity of direction.
In order to be able to do this, we must first solve the following
problem. If we are given the Cartesian co-ordinates, x?, and
the time, t, of an event relatively to one inertial system, K,
how can we calculate the co-ordinates, x
0
?, and the time, t
0
, of
the same event relatively to an inertial system K0 which moves
with uniform translation relatively to K? In the pre-relativity
physics this problem was solved by making unconsciously two
hypotheses:—
1. The time is absolute; the time of an event, t
0
, relatively
to K0
is the same as the time relatively to K. If instantaneous
signals could be sent to a distance, and if one knew that the
state of motion of a clock had no influence on its rate, then this
assumption would be physically established. For then clocks,
similar to one another, and regulated alike, could be distributed
over the systems K and K0
, at rest relatively to them, and their
indications would be independent of the state of motion of the
systems; the time of an event would then be given by the clock
in its immediate neighbourhood.
2. Length is absolute; if an interval, at rest relatively to K,
has a length s, then it has the same length s relatively to a
system K0 which is in motion relatively to K.
If the axes of K and K0 are parallel to each other, a simple
calculation based on these two assumptions, gives the equations
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 27
of transformation

? = x? - a? - b?t,
t
0 = t - b. )
(21)
This transformation is known as the “Galilean Transformation.”
Differentiating twice by the time, we get

Further, it follows that for two simultaneous events,
x

(2)
.
The invariance of the distance between the two points results
from squaring and adding. From this easily follows the covariance
of Newton’s equations of motion with respect to the
Galilean transformation (21). Hence it follows that classical
mechanics is in accord with the principle of special relativity if
the two hypotheses respecting scales and clocks are made.
But this attempt to found relativity of translation upon the
Galilean transformation fails when applied to electromagnetic
phenomena. The Maxwell-Lorentz electromagnetic equations
are not co-variant with respect to the Galilean transformation.
In particular, we note, by (21), that a ray of light which referred
to K has a velocity c, has a different velocity referred to K0
,
depending upon its direction. The space of reference of K is
therefore distinguished, with respect to its physical properties,
from all spaces of reference which are in motion relatively to it
(quiescent æther). But all experiments have shown that electromagnetic
and optical phenomena, relatively to the earth as the
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 28
body of reference, are not influenced by the translational velocity
of the earth. The most important of these experiments are
those of Michelson and Morley, which I shall assume are known.
The validity of the principle of special relativity can therefore
hardly be doubted.
On the other hand, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations have
proved their validity in the treatment of optical problems in
moving bodies. No other theory has satisfactorily explained the
facts of aberration, the propagation of light in moving bodies
(Fizeau), and phenomena observed in double stars (De Sitter).
The consequence of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations that in a
vacuum light is propagated with the velocity c, at least with respect
to a definite inertial system K, must therefore be regarded
as proved. According to the principle of special relativity, we
must also assume the truth of this principle for every other
inertial system.
Before we draw any conclusions from these two principles
we must first review the physical significance of the concepts
“time” and “velocity.” It follows from what has gone before, that
co-ordinates with respect to an inertial system are physically
defined by means of measurements and constructions with the
aid of rigid bodies. In order to measure time, we have supposed
a clock, U, present somewhere, at rest relatively to K. But
we cannot fix the time, by means of this clock, of an event
whose distance from the clock is not negligible; for there are no
“instantaneous signals” that we can use in order to compare the
time of the event with that of the clock. In order to complete the
definition of time we may employ the principle of the constancy
of the velocity of light in a vacuum. Let us suppose that we
place similar clocks at points of the system K, at rest relatively
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 29
to it, and regulated according to the following scheme. A ray
of light is sent out from one of the clocks, Um, at the instant
when it indicates the time tm, and travels through a vacuum a
distance rmn, to the clock Un; at the instant when this ray meets
the clock Un the latter is set to indicate the time tn = tm +
rmn
c
.
*
The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light then states
that this adjustment of the clocks will not lead to contradictions.
With clocks so adjusted, we can assign the time to events which
take place near any one of them. It is essential to note that this
definition of time relates only to the inertial system K, since
we have used a system of clocks at rest relatively to K. The
assumption which was made in the pre-relativity physics of the
absolute character of time (i.e. the independence of time of the
choice of the inertial system) does not follow at all from this
definition.
The theory of relativity is often criticized for giving, without
justification, a central theoretical rˆole to the propagation
of light, in that it founds the concept of time upon the law of
propagation of light. The situation, however, is somewhat as
follows. In order to give physical significance to the concept of
time, processes of some kind are required which enable relations
to be established between different places. It is immaterial what
kind of processes one chooses for such a definition of time. It
is advantageous, however, for the theory, to choose only those
*Strictly speaking, it would be more correct to define simultaneity first,
somewhat as follows: two events taking place at the points A and B of
the system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when
observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then
defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relatively
to K, which register the same simultaneously.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 30
processes concerning which we know something certain. This
holds for the propagation of light in vacuo in a higher degree
than for any other process which could be considered, thanks to
the investigations of Maxwell and H. A. Lorentz.
From all of these considerations, space and time data have
a physically real, and not a mere fictitious, significance; in particular
this holds for all the relations in which co-ordinates and
time enter, e.g. the relations (21). There is, therefore, sense in
asking whether those equations are true or not, as well as in
asking what the true equations of transformation are by which
we pass from one inertial system K to another, K0
, moving relatively
to it. It may be shown that this is uniquely settled by
means of the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light
and the principle of special relativity.
To this end we think of space and time physically defined
with respect to two inertial systems, K and K0
, in the way that
has been shown. Further, let a ray of light pass from one point P1
to another point P2 of K through a vacuum. If r is the measured
distance between the two points, then the propagation of light
must satisfy the equation
r = c · ?t.
If we square this equation, and express r
2 by the differences
of the co-ordinates, ?x?, in place of this equation we can write
X(?x?)
2 - c
2 ?t
2 = 0. (22)
This equation formulates the principle of the constancy of the
velocity of light relatively to K. It must hold whatever may be
the motion of the source which emits the ray of light.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 31
The same propagation of light may also be considered relatively
to K0
, in which case also the principle of the constancy of
the velocity of light must be satisfied. Therefore, with respect
to K0
, we have the equation
X(?x
0
?)
2 - c
2 ?t
02 = 0. (22a)
Equations (22a) and (22) must be mutually consistent with
each other with respect to the transformation which transforms
from K to K0
. A transformation which effects this we shall call
a “Lorentz transformation.”
Before considering these transformations in detail we shall
make a few general remarks about space and time. In the prerelativity
physics space and time were separate entities. Specifications
of time were independent of the choice of the space of
reference. The Newtonian mechanics was relative with respect
to the space of reference, so that, e.g. the statement that two
non-simultaneous events happened at the same place had no objective
meaning (that is, independent of the space of reference).
But this relativity had no rˆole in building up the theory. One
spoke of points of space, as of instants of time, as if they were
absolute realities. It was not observed that the true element
of the space-time specification was the event, specified by the
four numbers x1, x2, x3, t. The conception of something happening
was always that of a four-dimensional continuum; but
the recognition of this was obscured by the absolute character
of the pre-relativity time. Upon giving up the hypothesis of the
absolute character of time, particularly that of simultaneity, the
four-dimensionality of the time-space concept was immediately
recognized. It is neither the point in space, nor the instant in
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 32
time, at which something happens that has physical reality, but
only the event itself. There is no absolute (independent of the
space of reference) relation in space, and no absolute relation
in time between two events, but there is an absolute (independent
of the space of reference) relation in space and time, as
will appear in the sequel. The circumstance that there is no
objective rational division of the four-dimensional continuum
into a three-dimensional space and a one-dimensional time continuum
indicates that the laws of nature will assume a form
which is logically most satisfactory when expressed as laws in
the four-dimensional space-time continuum. Upon this depends
the great advance in method which the theory of relativity owes
to Minkowski. Considered from this standpoint, we must regard
x1, x2, x3, t as the four co-ordinates of an event in the fourdimensional
continuum. We have far less success in picturing
to ourselves relations in this four-dimensional continuum than
in the three-dimensional Euclidean continuum; but it must be
emphasized that even in the Euclidean three-dimensional geometry
its concepts and relations are only of an abstract nature in
our minds, and are not at all identical with the images we form
visually and through our sense of touch. The non-divisibility of
the four-dimensional continuum of events does not at all, however,
involve the equivalence of the space co-ordinates with the
time co-ordinate. On the contrary, we must remember that the
time co-ordinate is defined physically wholly differently from the
space co-ordinates. The relations (22) and (22a) which when
equated define the Lorentz transformation show, further, a difference
in the rˆole of the time co-ordinate from that of the space
co-ordinates; for the term ?t
2 has the opposite sign to the space
terms, ?x1
2
, ?x2
2
, ?x3
2
.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 33
Before we analyse further the conditions which define the
Lorentz transformation, we shall introduce the light-time, l = ct,
in place of the time, t, in order that the constant c shall not
enter explicitly into the formulas to be developed later. Then
the Lorentz transformation is defined in such a way that, first,
it makes the equation
?x1
2 + ?x2
2 + ?x3
2 - ?l
2 = 0 (22b)
a co-variant equation, that is, an equation which is satisfied with
respect to every inertial system if it is satisfied in the inertial
system to which we refer the two given events (emission and
reception of the ray of light). Finally, with Minkowski, we introduce
in place of the real time co-ordinate l = ct, the imaginary
time co-ordinate
x4 = il = ict (
v
-1 = i).
Then the equation defining the propagation of light, which must
be co-variant with respect to the Lorentz transformation, becomes

condition is satisfied only by linear transformations, that is,
transformations of the type
x
0
µ = aµ + bµaxa (24)
in which the summation over the a is to be extended from a = 1
to a = 4. A glance at equations (23) and (24) shows that the
Lorentz transformation so defined is identical with the translational
and rotational transformations of the Euclidean geometry,
if we disregard the number of dimensions and the relations of reality.
We can also conclude that the coefficients bµa must satisfy
the conditions
bµab?a = dµ? = baµba?. (25)
Since the ratios of the x? are real, it follows that all the aµ and
the bµa are real, except a4, b41, b42, b43, b14, b24 and b34, which
are purely imaginary.
Special Lorentz Transformation. We obtain the simplest
transformations of the type of (24) and (25) if only two of the
co-ordinates are to be transformed, and if all the aµ, which determine
the new origin, vanish. We obtain then for the indices

On account of the relations of reality ? must be taken as
imaginary. To interpret these equations physically, we introduce
the real light-time l and the velocity v of K0
relatively to K,
instead of the imaginary angle ?. We have, first,

1 = x1 cos ? - ilsin ?,
l
0 = -ix1 sin ? + l cos ?.
Since for the origin of K0
i.e., for x1 = 0, we must have x1 = vl,

These equations form the well-known special Lorentz transformation,
which in the general theory represents a rotation,
through an imaginary angle, of the four-dimensional system of
co-ordinates. If we introduce the ordinary time t, in place of the
light-time l, then in (29) we must replace l by ct and v by v
c
.
We must now fill in a gap. From the principle of the constancy
of the velocity of light it follows that the equation
X?x?
2 = 0
has a significance which is independent of the choice of the inertial
system; but the invariance of the quantity P?x?
2
does
not at all follow from this. This quantity might be transformed
with a factor. This depends upon the fact that the right-hand
side of (29) might be multiplied by a factor ?, independent of v.
But the principle of relativity does not permit this factor to be
different from 1, as we shall now show. Let us assume that we
have a rigid circular cylinder moving in the direction of its axis.
If its radius, measured at rest with a unit measuring rod is equal
to R0, its radius R in motion, might be different from R0, since
the theory of relativity does not make the assumption that the
shape of bodies with respect to a space of reference is independent
of their motion relatively to this space of reference. But
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 37
all directions in space must be equivalent to each other. R may
therefore depend upon the magnitude q of the velocity, but not
upon its direction; R must therefore be an even function of q. If
the cylinder is at rest relatively to K0
the equation of its lateral
surface is
x
02 + y
02 = R0
2
.
If we write the last two equations of (29) more generally
x
0
2 = ?x2,
x
0
3 = ?x3,
then the lateral surface of the cylinder referred to K satisfies the
equation
x
2 + y
2 =
R0
2
?
2
.
The factor ? therefore measures the lateral contraction of the
cylinder, and can thus, from the above, be only an even function
of v.
If we introduce a third system of co-ordinates, K00, which
moves relatively to K0 with velocity v in the direction of the
negative x-axis of K, we obtain, by applying (29) twice,
x
00
1 = ?(v)?(-v)x1,
x
00
2 = ?(v)?(-v)x2,
x
00
3 = ?(v)?(-v)x3,
l
00 = ?(v)?(-v)l.
Now, since ?(v) must be equal to ?(-v), and since we assume
that we use the same measuring rods in all the systems, it follows
that the transformation of K00 to K must be the identical
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 38
transformation (since the possibility ? = -1 does not need to
be considered). It is essential for these considerations to assume
that the behaviour of the measuring rods does not depend upon
the history of their previous motion.
Moving Measuring Rods and Clocks. At the definite Ktime,
l = 0, the position of the points given by the integers
x
0
1 = n, is with respect to K, given by x1 = n
v
1 - v
2
; this follows
from the first of equations (29) and expresses the Lorentz
contraction. A clock at rest at the origin x1 = 0 of K, whose
beats are characterized by l = n, will, when observed from K0
,
have beats characterized by
l
0 =
n
v
1 - v
2
;
this follows from the second of equations (29) and shows that
the clock goes slower than if it were at rest relatively to K0
.
These two consequences, which hold, mutatis mutandis, for every
system of reference, form the physical content, free from
convention, of the Lorentz transformation.
Addition Theorem for Velocities. If we combine two special
Lorentz transformations with the relative velocities v1 and v2,
then the velocity of the single Lorentz transformation which
takes the place of the two separate ones is, according to (27),
given by
v12 = itan(?1 + ?2) = i
tan ?1 + tan ?2
1 - tan ?1 tan ?2
=
v1 + v2
1 + v1v2
. (30)
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 39
General Statements about the Lorentz Transformation and
its Theory of Invariants. The whole theory of invariants of the
special theory of relativity depends upon the invariant s
2
(23).
Formally, it has the same rˆole in the four-dimensional space-time
continuum as the invariant ?x1
2+?x2
2+?x3
2
in the Euclidean
geometry and in the pre-relativity physics. The latter quantity
is not an invariant with respect to all the Lorentz transformations;
the quantity s
2 of equation (23) assumes the rˆole of this
invariant. With respect to an arbitrary inertial system, s
2 may
be determined by measurements; with a given unit of measure
it is a completely determinate quantity, associated with an arbitrary
pair of events.
The invariant s
2 differs, disregarding the number of dimensions,
from the corresponding invariant of the Euclidean geometry
in the following points. In the Euclidean geometry s
2
is
necessarily positive; it vanishes only when the two points concerned
come together. On the other hand, from the vanishing
of
s
2 =
X
(4)
?x?
2 = ?x1
2 + ?x2
2 + ?x3
2 - ?t
2
it cannot be concluded that the two space-time points fall together;
the vanishing of this quantity s
2
, is the invariant condition
that the two space-time points can be connected by a light
signal in vacuo. If P is a point (event) represented in the fourdimensional
space of the x1, x2, x3, l, then all the “points” which
can be connected to P by means of a light signal lie upon the
cone s
2 = 0 (compare Fig. 1, in which the dimension x3 is suppressed).
The “upper” half of the cone may contain the “points”
to which light signals can be sent from P; then the “lower” half
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 40

of the cone will contain the “points” from which light signals
can be sent to P. The points P
0
enclosed by the conical surface
furnish, with P, a negative s
2
; P P0
, as well as P
0P is then, according
to Minkowski, of the nature of a time. Such intervals
represent elements of possible paths of motion, the velocity being
less than that of light.*
In this case the l-axis may be drawn
*That material velocities exceeding that of light are not possible, follows
from the appearance of the radical v
1 - v
2 in the special Lorentz
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 41
in the direction of P P0 by suitably choosing the state of motion
of the inertial system. If P
0
lies outside of the “light-cone” then
P P0
is of the nature of a space; in this case, by properly choosing
the inertial system, ?l can be made to vanish.
By the introduction of the imaginary time variable, x4 =
il, Minkowski has made the theory of invariants for the fourdimensional
continuum of physical phenomena fully analogous
to the theory of invariants for the three-dimensional continuum
of Euclidean space. The theory of four-dimensional tensors of
special relativity differs from the theory of tensors in threedimensional
space, therefore, only in the number of dimensions
and the relations of reality.
A physical entity which is specified by four quantities, A?,
in an arbitrary inertial system of the x1, x2, x3, x4, is called
a 4-vector, with the components A?, if the A? correspond in
their relations of reality and the properties of transformation to
the ?x?; it may be of the nature of a space or of a time. The
sixteen quantities Aµ? then form the components of a tensor of
the second rank, if they transform according to the scheme
A
0
µ? = bµab?ßAaß.
It follows from this that the Aµ? behave, with respect to
their properties of transformation and their properties of reality,
as the products of components, UµV?, of two 4-vectors,
(U) and (V ). All the components are real except those which
contain the index 4 once, those being purely imaginary. Tensors
of the third and higher ranks may be defined in an analogous
way. The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
transformation (29).
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 42
contraction and differentiation for these tensors are wholly
analogous to the corresponding operations for tensors in threedimensional
space.
Before we apply the tensor theory to the four-dimensional
space-time continuum, we shall examine more particularly the
skew-symmetrical tensors. The tensor of the second rank has, in
general, 16 = 4·4 components. In the case of skew-symmetry the
components with two equal indices vanish, and the components
with unequal indices are equal and opposite in pairs. There
exist, therefore, only six independent components, as is the case
in the electromagnetic field. In fact, it will be shown when we
consider Maxwell’s equations that these may be looked upon as
tensor equations, provided we regard the electromagnetic field
as a skew-symmetrical tensor. Further, it is clear that the skewsymmetrical
tensor of the third rank (skew-symmetrical in all
pairs of indices) has only four independent components, since
there are only four combinations of three different indices.
We now turn to Maxwell’s equations (19a), (19b), (20a),
(20b), and introduce the notation:*

(31)
with the convention that fµ? shall be equal to -f?µ. Then
*
In order to avoid confusion from now on we shall use the threedimensional
space indices, x, y, z instead of 1, 2, 3, and we shall reserve the
numeral indices 1, 2, 3, 4 for the four-dimensional space-time continuum.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 43
Maxwell’s equations may be combined into the forms
?fµ?
?x?
= Jµ, (32)
?fµ?
?xs
+
?f?s
?xµ
+
?fsµ
?x?
= 0, (33)
as one can easily verify by substituting from (30a) and (31).
Equations (32) and (33) have a tensor character, and are
therefore co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations,
if the fµ? and the J? have a tensor character, which we assume.
Consequently, the laws for transforming these quantities from
one to another allowable (inertial) system of co-ordinates are
uniquely determined. The progress in method which electrodynamics
owes to the theory of special relativity lies principally
in this, that the number of independent hypotheses is diminished.
If we consider, for example, equations (19a) only from the
standpoint of relativity of direction, as we have done above, we
see that they have three logically independent terms. The way
in which the electric intensity enters these equations appears to
be wholly independent of the way in which the magnetic intensity
enters them; it would not be surprising if instead of ?eµ
?l ,
we had, say, ?
2eµ
?l2
, or if this term were absent. On the other
hand, only two independent terms appear in equation (32). The
electromagnetic field appears as a formal unit; the way in which
the electric field enters this equation is determined by the way in
which the magnetic field enters it. Besides the electromagnetic
field, only the electric current density appears as an independent
entity. This advance in method arises from the fact that the
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 44
electric and magnetic fields draw their separate existences from
the relativity of motion. A field which appears to be purely an
electric field, judged from one system, has also magnetic field
components when judged from another inertial system. When
applied to an electromagnetic field, the general law of transformation
furnishes, for the special case of the special Lorentz
transformation, the equations

(34)
If there exists with respect to K only a magnetic field, h, but
no electric field, e, then with respect to K0
there exists an electric
field e
0 as well, which would act upon an electric particle at rest
relatively to K0
. An observer at rest relatively to K would designate
this force as the Biot-Savart force, or the Lorentz electromotive
force. It therefore appears as if this electromotive force
had become fused with the electric field intensity into a single
entity.
In order to view this relation formally, let us consider the
expression for the force acting upon unit volume of electricity,
k = ?e + [i, h], (35)
in which i is the vector velocity of electricity, with the velocity
of light as the unit. If we introduce Jµ and fµ? according to
(30a) and (31), we obtain for the first component the expression
f12J2 + f13J3 + f14J4.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 45
Observing that f11 vanishes on account of the skew-symmetry of
the tensor (f), the components of k are given by the first three
components of the four-dimensional vector
Kµ = fµ?J?, (36)
and the fourth component is given by
K4 = f41J1 + f42J2 + f43J3 = i(exix + eyiy + eziz) = i?. (37)
There is, therefore, a four-dimensional vector of force per unit
volume, whose first three components, K1, K2, K3, are the ponderomotive
force components per unit volume, and whose fourth
component is the rate of working of the field per unit volume,
multiplied by v
-1.
A comparison of (36) and (35) shows that the theory of relativity
formally unites the ponderomotive force of the electric
field, ?e, and the Biot-Savart or Lorentz force [i, h].
Mass and Energy. An important conclusion can be drawn
from the existence and significance of the 4-vector Kµ. Let us
imagine a body upon which the electromagnetic field acts for
a time. In the symbolic figure (Fig. 2) Ox1 designates the x1-
axis, and is at the same time a substitute for the three space axes
Ox1, Ox2, Ox3; Ol designates the real time axis. In this diagram
a body of finite extent is represented, at a definite time l, by
the interval AB; the whole space-time existence of the body is
represented by a strip whose boundary is everywhere inclined
less than 45?
to the l-axis. Between the time sections, l = l1
and l = l2, but not extending to them, a portion of the strip is
shaded. This represents the portion of the space-time manifold

in which the electromagnetic field acts upon the body, or upon
the electric charges contained in it, the action upon them being
transmitted to the body. We shall now consider the changes
which take place in the momentum and energy of the body as a
result of this action.
We shall assume that the principles of momentum and
energy are valid for the body. The change in momentum,
?Ix, ?Iy, ?Iz, and the change in energy, ?E, are then given

Since the four-dimensional element of volume is an invariant,
and (K1, K2, K3, K4) forms a 4-vector, the four-dimensional integral
extended over the shaded portion transforms as a 4-vector,
as does also the integral between the limits l1 and l2, because
the portion of the region which is not shaded contributes nothing
to the integral. It follows, therefore, that ?Ix, ?Iy, ?Iz, i?E
form a 4-vector. Since the quantities themselves transform in
the same way as their increments, it follows that the aggregate
of the four quantities
Ix, Iy, Iz, iE
has itself the properties of a vector; these quantities are referred
to an instantaneous condition of the body (e.g. at the time l =
l1).
This 4-vector may also be expressed in terms of the mass m,
and the velocity of the body, considered as a material particle.
To form this expression, we note first, that
-ds2 = dt 2 = -(dx1

2 = dl2
(1 - q

THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 48
is an invariant which refers to an infinitely short portion of the
four-dimensional line which represents the motion of the material
particle. The physical significance of the invariant dt may
easily be given. If the time axis is chosen in such a way that it
has the direction of the line differential which we are considering,
or, in other words, if we reduce the material particle to rest,
we shall then have dt = dl; this will therefore be measured by
the light-seconds clock which is at the same place, and at rest
relatively to the material particle. We therefore call t the proper
time of the material particle. As opposed to dl, dt is therefore an
invariant, and is practically equivalent to dl for motions whose
velocity is small compared to that of light. Hence we see that
us =
dxs
dt (39)
has, just as the dx?, the character of a vector; we shall designate
(us) as the four-dimensional vector (in brief, 4-vector) of
velocity. Its components satisfy, by (38), the condition
Xus
2 = -1. (40)
We see that this 4-vector, whose components in the ordinary
notation are

We recognize, in fact, that these components of momentum
agree with those of classical mechanics for velocities which are
small compared to that of light. For large velocities the momentum
increases more rapidly than linearly with the velocity, so as
to become infinite on approaching the velocity of light.
If we apply the last of equations (43) to a material particle
at rest (q = 0), we see that the energy, E0, of a body at rest is
equal to its mass. Had we chosen the second as our unit of time,
we would have obtained
E0 = mc2
. (44)
Mass and energy are therefore essentially alike; they are only
different expressions for the same thing. The mass of a body
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 50
is not a constant; it varies with changes in its energy.* We see
from the last of equations (43) that E becomes infinite when
q approaches 1, the velocity of light. If we develop E in powers

Energy Tensor of the Electromagnetic Field. Before the development
of the theory of relativity it was known that the principles
of energy and momentum could be expressed in a differential
form for the electromagnetic field. The four-dimensional
formulation of these principles leads to an important conception,
*The emission of energy in radioactive processes is evidently connected
with the fact that the atomic weights are not integers. Attempts have been
made to draw conclusions from this concerning the structure and stability
of the atomic nuclei.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 51
that of the energy tensor, which is important for the further development
of the theory of relativity.
If in the expression for the 4-vector of force per unit volume,
Kµ = fµ?J?,
using the field equations (32), we express J? in terms of the
field intensities, fµ?, we obtain, after some transformations and
repeated application of the field equations (32) and (33), the

When expressed in the latter form, we see that the first three

the vector momentum per unit volume of the field. The last of
equations (47b) expresses the energy principle; s is the vector

SPECIAL RELATIVITY 53
We conclude from (48) that the energy tensor of the electromagnetic
field is symmetrical; with this is connected the fact
that the momentum per unit volume and the flow of energy are
equal to each other (relation between energy and inertia).
We therefore conclude from these considerations that the
energy per unit volume has the character of a tensor. This has
been proved directly only for an electromagnetic field, although
we may claim universal validity for it. Maxwell’s equations determine
the electromagnetic field when the distribution of electric
charges and currents is known. But we do not know the
laws which govern the currents and charges. We do know, indeed,
that electricity consists of elementary particles (electrons,
positive nuclei), but from a theoretical point of view we cannot
comprehend this. We do not know the energy factors which
determine the distribution of electricity in particles of definite
size and charge, and all attempts to complete the theory in this
direction have failed. If then we can build upon Maxwell’s equations
in general, the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field
is known only outside the charged particles.*
In these regions,
outside of charged particles, the only regions in which we can believe
that we have the complete expression for the energy tensor,
we have, by (47),
?Tµ?
?x?
= 0. (47c)
*
It has been attempted to remedy this lack of knowledge by considering
the charged particles as proper singularities. But in my opinion this means
giving up a real understanding of the structure of matter. It seems to me
much better to give in to our present inability rather than to be satisfied
by a solution that is only apparent.

General Expressions for the Conservation Principles. We
can hardly avoid making the assumption that in all other cases,
also, the space distribution of energy is given by a symmetrical
tensor, Tµ?, and that this complete energy tensor everywhere
satisfies the relation (47c). At any rate we shall see that by
means of this assumption we obtain the correct expression for
the integral energy principle.
Let us consider a spatially bounded, closed system, which,
four-dimensionally, we may represent as a strip, outside of which
the Tµ? vanish. Integrate equation (47c) over a space section.
Since the integrals of ?Tµ1

?Tµ2

the Tµ? vanish at the limits of integration, we obtain

of energy and the conservation principles will be seen
from the following considerations.

Hydrodynamical Equations. We know that matter is built
up of electrically charged particles, but we do not know the laws
which govern the constitution of these particles. In treating mechanical
problems, we are therefore obliged to make use of an

inexact description of matter, which corresponds to that of classical
mechanics. The density s, of a material substance and the
hydrodynamical pressures are the fundamental concepts upon
which such a description is based.
Let s0 be the density of matter at a place, estimated with
reference to a system of co-ordinates moving with the matter.
Then s0, the density at rest, is an invariant. If we think of the
matter in arbitrary motion and neglect the pressures (particles
of dust in vacuo, neglecting the size of the particles and the
temperature), then the energy tensor will depend only upon the
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 56
velocity components, u? and s0. We secure the tensor character
of Tµ? by putting
Tµ? = s0uµu?, (50)
in which the uµ, in the three-dimensional representation, are
given by (41). In fact, it follows from (50) that for q = 0, T44 =
-s0 (equal to the negative energy per unit volume), as it should,
according to the theorem of the equivalence of mass and energy,
and according to the physical interpretation of the energy tensor
given above. If an external force (four-dimensional vector, Kµ)
acts upon the matter, by the principles of momentum and energy
the equation
Kµ =
?Tµ?
?x?
must hold. We shall now show that this equation leads to the
same law of motion of a material particle as that already obtained.
Let us imagine the matter to be of infinitely small extent
in space, that is, a four-dimensional thread; then by integration
over the whole thread with respect to the space co-ordinates
x1, x2, x3, we obtain

Now R

R
s0 dx1 dx2 dx3 dx4. We shall calculate this integral, first with
respect to the inertial system which we have chosen, and second,
with respect to a system relatively to which the matter has the
velocity zero. The integration is to be extended over a filament
SPECIAL RELATIVITY 57
of the thread for which s0 may be regarded as constant over the
whole section. If the space volumes of the filament referred to
the two systems are dV and dV0 respectively, then we have

We see, therefore, that the generalized conception of the energy
tensor is in agreement with our former result.
The Eulerian Equations for Perfect Fluids. In order to get
nearer to the behaviour of real matter we must add to the energy
tensor a term which corresponds to the pressures. The simplest
case is that of a perfect fluid in which the pressure is determined
by a scalar p. Since the tangential stresses pxy, etc., vanish in
this case, the contribution to the energy tensor must be of the
form pd?µ. We must therefore put
Tµ? = suµu? + pdµ?. (51)

At rest, the density of the matter, or the energy per unit volume,
is in this case, not s but s - p. For

the term dp

(52), the conservation principles take the form

The equations for the first three indices evidently correspond to
the Eulerian equations. That the equations (52) and (53) correspond,
to a first approximation, to the hydrodynamical equations
of classical mechanics, is a further confirmation of the generalized
energy principle. The density of matter and of energy
has the character of a symmetrical tensor.
LECTURE III
THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
All of the previous considerations have been based upon the
assumption that all inertial systems are equivalent for the description
of physical phenomena, but that they are preferred, for
the formulation of the laws of nature, to spaces of reference in a
different state of motion. We can think of no cause for this preference
for definite states of motion to all others, according to our
previous considerations, either in the perceptible bodies or in the
concept of motion; on the contrary, it must be regarded as an independent
property of the space-time continuum. The principle
of inertia, in particular, seems to compel us to ascribe physically
objective properties to the space-time continuum. Just as
it was necessary from the Newtonian standpoint to make both
the statements, tempus est absolutum, spatium est absolutum, so
from the standpoint of the special theory of relativity we must
say, continuum spatii et temporis est absolutum. In this latter
statement absolutum means not only “physically real,” but also
“independent in its physical properties, having a physical effect,
but not itself influenced by physical conditions.”
As long as the principle of inertia is regarded as the keystone
of physics, this standpoint is certainly the only one which
is justified. But there are two serious criticisms of the ordinary
conception. In the first place, it is contrary to the mode of thinking
in science to conceive of a thing (the space-time continuum)
which acts itself, but which cannot be acted upon. This is the
reason why E. Mach was led to make the attempt to eliminate
space as an active cause in the system of mechanics. Accord59
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 60
ing to him, a material particle does not move in unaccelerated
motion relatively to space, but relatively to the centre of all the
other masses in the universe; in this way the series of causes of
mechanical phenomena was closed, in contrast to the mechanics
of Newton and Galileo. In order to develop this idea within the
limits of the modern theory of action through a medium, the
properties of the space-time continuum which determine inertia
must be regarded as field properties of space, analogous to the
electromagnetic field. The concepts of classical mechanics afford
no way of expressing this. For this reason Mach’s attempt
at a solution failed for the time being. We shall come back to
this point of view later. In the second place, classical mechanics
indicates a limitation which directly demands an extension of
the principle of relativity to spaces of reference which are not
in uniform motion relatively to each other. The ratio of the
masses of two bodies is defined in mechanics in two ways which
differ from each other fundamentally; in the first place, as the
reciprocal ratio of the accelerations which the same motional
force imparts to them (inert mass), and in the second place, as
the ratio of the forces which act upon them in the same gravitational
field (gravitational mass). The equality of these two
masses, so differently defined, is a fact which is confirmed by
experiments of very high accuracy (experiments of E¨otv¨os), and
classical mechanics offers no explanation for this equality. It is,
however, clear that science is fully justified in assigning such a
numerical equality only after this numerical equality is reduced
to an equality of the real nature of the two concepts.
That this object may actually be attained by an extension
of the principle of relativity, follows from the following consideration.
A little reflection will show that the theorem of the
THE GENERAL THEORY 61
equality of the inert and the gravitational mass is equivalent
to the theorem that the acceleration imparted to a body by a
gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For
Newton’s equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out
in full, is
(Inert mass) · (Acceleration) = (Intensity of the
gravitational field) · (Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inert
and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of
the nature of the body. Let now K be an inertial system. Masses
which are sufficiently far from each other and from other bodies
are then, with respect to K, free from acceleration. We shall
also refer these masses to a system of co-ordinates K0
, uniformly
accelerated with respect to K. Relatively to K0 all the masses
have equal and parallel accelerations; with respect to K0
they
behave just as if a gravitational field were present and K0 were
unaccelerated. Overlooking for the present the question as to the
“cause” of such a gravitational field, which will occupy us later,
there is nothing to prevent our conceiving this gravitational field
as real, that is, the conception that K0
is “at rest” and a gravitational
field is present we may consider as equivalent to the conception
that only K is an “allowable” system of co-ordinates and
no gravitational field is present. The assumption of the complete
physical equivalence of the systems of co-ordinates, K and K0
,
we call the “principle of equivalence;” this principle is evidently
intimately connected with the theorem of the equality between
the inert and the gravitational mass, and signifies an extension
of the principle of relativity to co-ordinate systems which are in
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 62
non-uniform motion relatively to each other. In fact, through
this conception we arrive at the unity of the nature of inertia
and gravitation. For according to our way of looking at it, the
same masses may appear to be either under the action of inertia
alone (with respect to K) or under the combined action of
inertia and gravitation (with respect to K0
). The possibility of
explaining the numerical equality of inertia and gravitation by
the unity of their nature gives to the general theory of relativity,
according to my conviction, such a superiority over the conceptions
of classical mechanics, that all the difficulties encountered
in development must be considered as small in comparison.
What justifies us in dispensing with the preference for inertial
systems over all other co-ordinate systems, a preference
that seems so securely established by experiment based upon
the principle of inertia? The weakness of the principle of inertia
lies in this, that it involves an argument in a circle: a mass moves
without acceleration if it is sufficiently far from other bodies; we
know that it is sufficiently far from other bodies only by the fact
that it moves without acceleration. Are there, in general, any
inertial systems for very extended portions of the space-time
continuum, or, indeed, for the whole universe? We may look
upon the principle of inertia as established, to a high degree of
approximation, for the space of our planetary system, provided
that we neglect the perturbations due to the sun and planets.
Stated more exactly, there are finite regions, where, with respect
to a suitably chosen space of reference, material particles move
freely without acceleration, and in which the laws of the special
theory of relativity, which have been developed above, hold
with remarkable accuracy. Such regions we shall call “Galilean
regions.” We shall proceed from the consideration of such re-
THE GENERAL THEORY 63
gions as a special case of known properties.
The principle of equivalence demands that in dealing with
Galilean regions we may equally well make use of non-inertial
systems, that is, such co-ordinate systems as, relatively to inertial
systems, are not free from acceleration and rotation. If,
further, we are going to do away completely with the difficult
question as to the objective reason for the preference of certain
systems of co-ordinates, then we must allow the use of arbitrarily
moving systems of co-ordinates. As soon as we make this
attempt seriously we come into conflict with that physical interpretation
of space and time to which we were led by the special
theory of relativity. For let K0 be a system of co-ordinates whose
z
0
-axis coincides with the z-axis of K, and which rotates about
the latter axis with constant angular velocity. Are the configurations
of rigid bodies, at rest relatively to K0
, in accordance with
the laws of Euclidean geometry? Since K0
is not an inertial system,
we do not know directly the laws of configuration of rigid
bodies with respect to K0
, nor the laws of nature, in general. But
we do know these laws with respect to the inertial system K,
and we can therefore estimate them with respect to K0
. Imagine
a circle drawn about the origin in the x
0
-y
0 plane of K0
, and a
diameter of this circle. Imagine, further, that we have given a
large number of rigid rods, all equal to each other. We suppose
these laid in series along the periphery and the diameter of the
circle, at rest relatively to K0
. If U is the number of these rods
along the periphery, D the number along the diameter, then, if
K0 does not rotate relatively to K, we shall have
U
D
= p.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 64
But if K0
rotates we get a different result. Suppose that at
a definite time t of K we determine the ends of all the rods.
With respect to K all the rods upon the periphery experience
the Lorentz contraction, but the rods upon the diameter do not
experience this contraction (along their lengths!).*
It therefore
follows that
U
D
> p.
It therefore follows that the laws of configuration of rigid
bodies with respect to K0 do not agree with the laws of configuration
of rigid bodies that are in accordance with Euclidean geometry.
If, further, we place two similar clocks (rotating with K0
),
one upon the periphery, and the other at the centre of the circle,
then, judged from K, the clock on the periphery will go
slower than the clock at the centre. The same thing must take
place, judged from K0
, if we define time with respect to K0
in a
not wholly unnatural way, that is, in such a way that the laws
with respect to K0 depend explicitly upon the time. Space and
time, therefore, cannot be defined with respect to K0 as they
were in the special theory of relativity with respect to inertial
systems. But, according to the principle of equivalence, K0
is
also to be considered as a system at rest, with respect to which
there is a gravitational field (field of centrifugal force, and force
of Coriolis). We therefore arrive at the result: the gravitational
field influences and even determines the metrical laws of the
space-time continuum. If the laws of configuration of ideal rigid
bodies are to be expressed geometrically, then in the presence
*These considerations assume that the behaviour of rods and clocks
depends only upon velocities, and not upon accelerations, or, at least, that
the influence of acceleration does not counteract that of velocity.
THE GENERAL THEORY 65
of a gravitational field the geometry is not Euclidean.
The case that we have been considering is analogous to that
which is presented in the two-dimensional treatment of surfaces.
It is impossible in the latter case also, to introduce coordinates
on a surface (e.g. the surface of an ellipsoid) which
have a simple metrical significance, while on a plane the Cartesian
co-ordinates, x1, x2, signify directly lengths measured by a
unit measuring rod. Gauss overcame this difficulty, in his theory
of surfaces, by introducing curvilinear co-ordinates which,
apart from satisfying conditions of continuity, were wholly arbitrary,
and afterwards these co-ordinates were related to the
metrical properties of the surface. In an analogous way we
shall introduce in the general theory of relativity arbitrary coordinates,
x1, x2, x3, x4, which shall number uniquely the spacetime
points, so that neighbouring events are associated with
neighbouring values of the co-ordinates; otherwise, the choice
of co-ordinates is arbitrary. We shall be true to the principle
of relativity in its broadest sense if we give such a form to the
laws that they are valid in every such four-dimensional system
of co-ordinates, that is, if the equations expressing the laws are
co-variant with respect to arbitrary transformations.
The most important point of contact between Gauss’s theory
of surfaces and the general theory of relativity lies in the metrical
properties upon which the concepts of both theories, in the
main, are based. In the case of the theory of surfaces, Gauss’s
argument is as follows. Plane geometry may be based upon the
concept of the distance ds, between two indefinitely near points.
The concept of this distance is physically significant because
the distance can be measured directly by means of a rigid measuring
rod. By a suitable choice of Cartesian co-ordinates this
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 66
distance may be expressed by the formula ds2 = dx1
2 + dx2
2
.
We may base upon this quantity the concepts of the straight
line as the geodesic (d
R
ds = 0), the interval, the circle, and the
angle, upon which the Euclidean plane geometry is built. A
geometry may be developed upon another continuously curved
surface, if we observe that an infinitesimally small portion of the
surface may be regarded as plane, to within relatively infinitesimal
quantities. There are Cartesian co-ordinates, X1, X2, upon
such a small portion of the surface, and the distance between
two points, measured by a measuring rod, is given by
ds2 = dX1
2 + dX2
2
.
If we introduce arbitrary curvilinear co-ordinates, x1, x2, on the
surface, then dX1, dX2, may be expressed linearly in terms of
dx1, dx2. Then everywhere upon the surface we have
ds2 = g11 dx1
2 + 2g12 dx1 dx2 + g22 dx2
2
,
where g11, g12, g22 are determined by the nature of the surface
and the choice of co-ordinates; if these quantities are known,
then it is also known how networks of rigid rods may be laid
upon the surface. In other words, the geometry of surfaces may
be based upon this expression for ds2
exactly as plane geometry
is based upon the corresponding expression.
There are analogous relations in the four-dimensional spacetime
continuum of physics. In the immediate neighbourhood of
an observer, falling freely in a gravitational field, there exists no
gravitational field. We can therefore always regard an infinitesimally
small region of the space-time continuum as Galilean.
For such an infinitely small region there will be an inertial system
(with the space co-ordinates, X1, X2, X3, and the time
THE GENERAL THEORY 67
co-ordinate X4) relatively to which we are to regard the laws of
the special theory of relativity as valid. The quantity which is
directly measurable by our unit measuring rods and clocks,
dX1
2 + dX2
2 + dX3
2 - dX4
2
,
or its negative,
ds2 = -dX1
2 - dX2
2 - dX3
2 + dX4
2
, (54)
is therefore a uniquely determinate invariant for two neighbouring
events (points in the four-dimensional continuum), provided
that we use measuring rods that are equal to each other when
brought together and superimposed, and clocks whose rates are
the same when they are brought together. In this the physical
assumption is essential that the relative lengths of two measuring
rods and the relative rates of two clocks are independent, in
principle, of their previous history. But this assumption is certainly
warranted by experience; if it did not hold there could be
no sharp spectral lines; for the single atoms of the same element
certainly do not have the same history, and it would be absurd
to suppose any relative difference in the structure of the single
atoms due to their previous history if the mass and frequencies
of the single atoms of the same element were always the same.
Space-time regions of finite extent are, in general, not
Galilean, so that a gravitational field cannot be done away
with by any choice of co-ordinates in a finite region. There
is, therefore, no choice of co-ordinates for which the metrical
relations of the special theory of relativity hold in a finite region.
But the invariant ds always exists for two neighbouring
points (events) of the continuum. This invariant ds may be
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 68
expressed in arbitrary co-ordinates. If one observes that the
local dX? may be expressed linearly in terms of the co-ordinate
differentials dx?, ds2 may be expressed in the form
ds2 = gµ? dxµ dx?. (55)
The functions gµ? describe, with respect to the arbitrarily
chosen system of co-ordinates, the metrical relations of the
space-time continuum and also the gravitational field. As in
the special theory of relativity, we have to discriminate between
time-like and space-like line elements in the four-dimensional
continuum; owing to the change of sign introduced, time-like line
elements have a real, space-like line elements an imaginary ds.
The time-like ds can be measured directly by a suitably chosen
clock.
According to what has been said, it is evident that the formulation
of the general theory of relativity assumes a generalization
of the theory of invariants and the theory of tensors; the question
is raised as to the form of the equations which are co-variant
with respect to arbitrary point transformations. The generalized
calculus of tensors was developed by mathematicians long before
the theory of relativity. Riemann first extended Gauss’s
train of thought to continua of any number of dimensions; with
prophetic vision he saw the physical meaning of this generalization
of Euclid’s geometry. Then followed the development of
the theory in the form of the calculus of tensors, particularly by
Ricci and Levi-Civita. This is the place for a brief presentation
of the most important mathematical concepts and operations of
this calculus of tensors.
We designate four quantities, which are defined as functions
of the x? with respect to every system of co-ordinates, as com-
THE GENERAL THEORY 69
ponents, A?
, of a contra-variant vector, if they transform in a
change of co-ordinates as the co-ordinate differentials dx?. We
therefore have
A
0µ =
?x0
µ
?x?
A
?
. (56)
Besides these contra-variant vectors, there are also co-variant
vectors. If B? are the components of a co-variant vector, these
vectors are transformed according to the rule
B
0
µ =
?x?
?x0
µ
B?. (57)
The definition of a co-variant vector is chosen in such a way that
a co-variant vector and a contra-variant vector together form a
scalar according to the scheme,
f = B?A
?
(summed over the ?).
Accordingly,
B
0
µA
0µ =
?xa
?x0
µ
?x0
µ
?xß
BaA
ß = BaA
a
.
In particular, the derivatives ?f
?xa
of a scalar f, are components
of a co-variant vector, which, with the co-ordinate differentials,
form the scalar ?f
?xa
dxa; we see from this example how natural
is the definition of the co-variant vectors.
There are here, also, tensors of any rank, which may have
co-variant or contra-variant character with respect to each index;
as with vectors, the character is designated by the position
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 70
of the index. For example, A?
µ denotes a tensor of the second
rank, which is co-variant with respect to the index µ, and contravariant
with respect to the index ?. The tensor character indicates
that the equation of transformation is
A
0?
µ =
?xa
?x0
µ
?x0
?
?xß

. (58)
Tensors may be formed by the addition and subtraction of
tensors of equal rank and like character, as in the theory of
invariants of orthogonal linear substitutions, for example,
A
?
µ + B
?
µ = C
?
µ
. (59)
The proof of the tensor character of C
?
µ depends upon (58).
Tensors may be formed by multiplication, keeping the character
of the indices, just as in the theory of invariants of linear
orthogonal transformations, for example,
A
?
µBst = C
?
µst . (60)
The proof follows directly from the rule of transformation.
Tensors may be formed by contraction with respect to two
indices of different character, for example,
A

µst = Bst . (61)

THE GENERAL THEORY 71
The properties of symmetry and skew-symmetry of a tensor
with respect to two indices of like character have the same
significance as in the theory of invariants.
With this, everything essential has been said with regard to
the algebraic properties of tensors.
The Fundamental Tensor. It follows from the invariance
of ds2
for an arbitrary choice of the dx?, in connexion with
the condition of symmetry consistent with (55), that the gµ?
are components of a symmetrical co-variant tensor (Fundamental
Tensor). Let us form the determinant, g, of the gµ?, and
also the minors, divided by g, corresponding to the single gµ?.
These minors, divided by g, will be denoted by g
µ?, and their
co-variant character is not yet known. Then we have
gµag
µß = d
ß
a =
(
1 if a = ß,
0 if a 6= ß.
(62)
If we form the infinitely small quantities (co-variant vectors)
d?µ = gµa dxa, (63)
multiply by g
µß and sum over the µ, we obtain, by the use
of (62),
dxß = g

Since the ratios of the d?µ are arbitrary, and the dxß as well as
the dxµ are components of vectors, it follows that the g
µ? are the
components of a contra-variant tensor*
(contra-variant fundamental
tensor). The tensor character of d

tensor) accordingly follows, by (62). By means of the fundamental
tensor, instead of tensors with co-variant index character, we
can introduce tensors with contra-variant index character, and
conversely. For example,
A
µ = g

Aµ = gµaA

Formation of Tensors by Differentiation. Although the algebraic
operations of tensor formation have proved to be as
simple as in the special case of invariance with respect to linear
orthogonal transformations, nevertheless in the general case,
the invariant differential operations are, unfortunately, considerably
more complicated. The reason for this is as follows. If
Aµ
is a contra-variant vector, the coefficients of its transformation,
?x0
µ
?x?
, are independent of position only if the transformation
is a linear one. For then the vector components, Aµ +
?Aµ
?xa
dxa,
at a neighbouring point transform in the same way as the Aµ
,
from which follows the vector character of the vector differentials,
and the tensor character of ?Aµ
?xa
. But if the ?x0
µ
?x?
are
variable this is no longer true.
That there are, nevertheless, in the general case, invariant
differential operations for tensors, is recognized most satisfactorily
in the following way, introduced by Levi-Civita and Weyl.
Let (Aµ
) be a contra-variant vector whose components are given
with respect to the co-ordinate system of the x?. Let P1 and P2
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 74
be two infinitesimally near points of the continuum. For the infinitesimal
region surrounding the point P1, there is, according
to our way of considering the matter, a co-ordinate system of
the X? (with imaginary X4-co-ordinate) for which the continuum
is Euclidean. Let A
µ
(1) be the co-ordinates of the vector at
the point P1. Imagine a vector drawn at the point P2, using the
local system of the X?, with the same co-ordinates (parallel vector
through P2), then this parallel vector is uniquely determined
by the vector at P1 and the displacement. We designate this operation,
whose uniqueness will appear in the sequel, the parallel
displacement of the vector Aµ from P1 to the infinitesimally near
point P2. If we form the vector difference of the vector (Aµ
) at
the point P2 and the vector obtained by parallel displacement
from P1 to P2, we get a vector which may be regarded as the
differential of the vector (Aµ
) for the given displacement (dx?).
This vector displacement can naturally also be considered
with respect to the co-ordinate system of the x?. If A? are the
co-ordinates of the vector at P1, A? + dA?
the co-ordinates of
the vector displaced to P2 along the interval (dx?), then the dA?
do not vanish in this case. We know of these quantities, which
do not have a vector character, that they must depend linearly
and homogeneously upon the dx? and the A?
. We therefore put
dA? = -G
?
aßA
a
dxß. (67)
In addition, we can state that the G?
aß must be symmetrical
with respect to the indices a and ß. For we can assume from
a representation by the aid of a Euclidean system of local coordinates
that the same parallelogram will be described by the
displacement of an element d
(1)x? along a second element d
(2)x?
THE GENERAL THEORY 75
as by a displacement of d
(2)x? along d
(1)x?. We must therefore
have
d
(2)x? + (d
(1)x? - G
?
aß d
(1)xa d
(2)xß)
= d
(1)x? + (d
(2)x? - G
?
aß d
(2)xa d
(1)xß).
The statement made above follows from this, after interchanging
the indices of summation, a and ß, on the right-hand side.
Since the quantities gµ? determine all the metrical properties
of the continuum, they must also determine the G?
aß. If we
consider the invariant of the vector A?
, that is, the square of its
magnitude,
gµ?A
µA
?
,
which is an invariant, this cannot change in a parallel displacement.
We therefore have
0 = d(gµ?A
µA
?
) = ?gµ?

A

dxa = 0.
Owing to the symmetry of the expression in the brackets
with respect to the indices µ and ?, this equation can be valid
for an arbitrary choice of the vectors (Aµ
) and dx? only when
the expression in the brackets vanishes for all combinations of
the indices. By a cyclic interchange of the indices µ, ?, a, we
obtain thus altogether three equations, from which we obtain,
on taking into account the symmetrical property of the Ga

Thus the quantities G are deduced from the gµ?. Equations
(67) and (70) are the foundation for the following discussion.
Co-variant Differentiation of Tensors. If (Aµ + dAµ
) is
the vector resulting from an infinitesimal parallel displacement
from P1 to P2, and (Aµ + dAµ
) the vector Aµ at the point P2,
then the difference of these two,
dAµ - dAµ =

?Aµ

is also a vector. Since this is the case for an arbitrary choice of
the dxs, it follows that
A
µ
; s =
?Aµ
?xs
+ Gµ
saA
a
(71)
is a tensor, which we designate as the co-variant derivative of
the tensor of the first rank (vector). Contracting this tensor, we
obtain the divergence of the contra-variant tensor Aµ
. In this
we must observe that according to (70),

THE GENERAL THEORY 77
If we put, further,
A
µv
g = A
µ
, (73)
a quantity designated by Weyl as the contra-variant tensor density*
of the first rank, it follows that,
A =
? A
µ
?xµ
(74)
is a scalar density.
We get the law of parallel displacement for the co-variant
vector Bµ by stipulating that the parallel displacement shall be
effected in such a way that the scalar
f = A
µBµ
remains unchanged, and that therefore
A
µ
dBµ + Bµ dAµ
vanishes for every value assigned to (Aµ
). We therefore get
dBµ = Ga
µsAa dxs. (75)
From this we arrive at the co-variant derivative of the covariant
vector by the same process as that which led to (71),
Bµ; s =
?Bµ
?xs
- G
a
µsBa. (76)
*This expression is justified, in that Aµvg dx = A
µ
dx has a tensor
character. Every tensor, when multiplied by vg, changes into a tensor
density. We employ capital Gothic letters for tensor densities.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 78
By interchanging the indices µ and ß, and subtracting, we get
the skew-symmetrical tensor,
fµs =
?Bµ
?xs
-
?Bs
?xµ
. (77)
For the co-variant differentiation of tensors of the second
and higher ranks we may use the process by which (75) was
deduced. Let, for example, (Ast ) be a co-variant tensor of the
second rank. Then AstE
sF
t
is a scalar, if E and F are vectors.
This expression must not be changed by the d-displacement;
expressing this by a formula, we get, using (67), dAst , whence
we get the desired co-variant derivative,
Ast; ? =
?Ast
?x?
- G
a
s?Aat - G
a
t ?Asa. (78)
In order that the general law of co-variant differentiation of
tensors may be clearly seen, we shall write down two co-variant
derivatives deduced in an analogous way:
A
t
s; ? =
?At
s
?x?

a?A

. (80)
The general law of formation now becomes evident. From these
formulæ we shall deduce some others which are of interest for
the physical applications of the theory.
In case Ast is skew-symmetrical, we obtain the tensor
Ast ? =
?Ast
?x?
+
?At ?
?xs
+
?A?s
?xt
, (81)
THE GENERAL THEORY 79
which is skew-symmetrical in all pairs of indices, by cyclic interchange
and addition.
If, in (78), we replace Ast by the fundamental tensor, gst ,
then the right-hand side vanishes identically; an analogous statement
holds for (80) with respect to g
st ; that is, the co-variant
derivatives of the fundamental tensor vanish. That this must be
so we see directly in the local system of co-ordinates.
In case Ast is skew-symmetrical, we obtain from (80), by
contraction with respect to t and ?,
A
s =
? A
st
?xt
. (82)
In the general case, from (79) and (80), by contraction with
respect to t and ?, we obtain the equations,

The Riemann Tensor. If we have given a curve extending
from the point P to the point G of the continuum, then a vector
Aµ
, given at P, may, by a parallel displacement, be moved
along the curve to G. If the continuum is Euclidean (more generally,
if by a suitable choice of co-ordinates the gµ? are constants)
then the vector obtained at G as a result of this displacement
does not depend upon the choice of the curve joining P and G.
But otherwise, the result depends upon the path of the displacement.
In this case, therefore, a vector suffers a change, ?Aµ
(in its direction, not its magnitude), when it is carried from a

point P of a closed curve, along the curve, and back to P. We
shall now calculate this vector change:
?A
µ =
I
dAµ
.
As in Stokes’ theorem for the line integral of a vector around
a closed curve, this problem may be reduced to the integration
around a closed curve with infinitely small linear dimensions; we
shall limit ourselves to this case.
We have, first, by (67),
?A
µ = -
I
G
µ
aßA
a
dxß.
In this, Gµ
aß is the value of this quantity at the variable
point G of the path of integration. If we put
?
µ = (xµ)G - (xµ)P

aß at P by G

sufficient accuracy,
G

.
Let, further, Aa be the value obtained from Aa by a parallel
displacement along the curve from P to G. It may now easily
be proved by means of (67) that Aµ - Aµ
is infinitely small of
the first order, while, for a curve of infinitely small dimensions
of the first order, ?Aµ
is infinitely small of the second order.
Therefore there is an error of only the second order if we put
A
a = Aa - G
a
st As

.
If we introduce these values of Gµ
aß and Aa
into the integral,
we obtain, neglecting all quantities of a higher order of small
quantities than the second,

This skew-symmetrical tensor of the second rank, f
aß, characterizes
the surface element bounded by the curve in magnitude
and position. If the expression in the brackets in (85) were
skew-symmetrical with respect to the indices a and ß, we could
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 82
conclude its tensor character from (85). We can accomplish this
by interchanging the summation indices a and ß in (85) and
adding the resulting equation to (85). We obtain

The tensor character of R
µ
saß follows from (86); this is the
Riemann curvature tensor of the fourth rank, whose properties of
symmetry we do not need to go into. Its vanishing is a sufficient
condition (disregarding the reality of the chosen co-ordinates)
that the continuum is Euclidean.
By contraction of the Riemann tensor with respect to the
indices µ, ß, we obtain the symmetrical tensor of the second

LECTURE IV
THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
(continued)
We are now in possession of the mathematical apparatus which
is necessary to formulate the laws of the general theory of relativity.
No attempt will be made in this presentation at systematic
completeness, but single results and possibilities will
be developed progressively from what is known and from the results
obtained. Such a presentation is most suited to the present
provisional state of our knowledge.
A material particle upon which no force acts moves, according
to the principle of inertia, uniformly in a straight line. In
the four-dimensional continuum of the special theory of relativity
(with real time co-ordinate) this is a real straight line. The
natural, that is, the simplest, generalization of the straight line
which is plausible in the system of concepts of Riemann’s general
theory of invariants is that of the straightest, or geodetic,
line. We shall accordingly have to assume, in the sense of the
principle of equivalence, that the motion of a material particle,
under the action only of inertia and gravitation, is described by
the equation,
d
2xµ
ds2
+ Gµ
aß
dxa
ds
dxß
ds = 0. (90)
In fact, this equation reduces to that of a straight line if all the
components, Gµ
aß, of the gravitational field vanish.
How are these equations connected with Newton’s equations
of motion? According to the special theory of relativity, the gµ?
as well as the g
µ?, have the values, with respect to an inertial

. (91)
The equations of motion then become
d
2xµ
ds2
= 0.
We shall call this the “first approximation” to the gµ?-field. In
considering approximations it is often useful, as in the special
theory of relativity, to use an imaginary x4-co-ordinate, as then
the gµ?, to the first approximation, assume the values
-1 0 0 0
0 -1 0 0
0 0 -1 0
0 0 0 -1
?
???
???
. (91a)
These values may be collected in the relation
gµ? = -dµ?.
To the second approximation we must then put
gµ? = -dµ? + ?µ?, (92)
where the ?µ? are to be regarded as small of the first order.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 86
Both terms of our equation of motion are then small of the
first order. If we neglect terms which, relatively to these, are
small of the first order, we have to put
ds2 = -dx?
2 = dl2
(1 - q

We shall now introduce an approximation of a second kind. Let
the velocity of the material particles be very small compared to
that of light. Then ds will be the same as the time differential,
dl. Further, dx1
ds ,
dx2
ds ,
dx3
ds will vanish compared to dx4
ds .
We shall assume, in addition, that the gravitational field varies
so little with the time that the derivatives of the ?µ? by x4 may
be neglected. Then the equation of motion (for µ = 1, 2, 3)
reduces to
d

. (90a)
This equation is identical with Newton’s equation of motion for
a material particle in a gravitational field, if we identify ?44


with the potential of the gravitational field; whether or not this
is allowable, naturally depends upon the field equations of gravitation,
that is, it depends upon whether or not this quantity
satisfies, to a first approximation, the same laws of the field
as the gravitational potential in Newton’s theory. A glance at
(90) and (90a) shows that the Gµ
aß actually do play the rˆole of
the intensity of the gravitational field. These quantities do not
have a tensor character.
Equations (90) express the influence of inertia and gravitation
upon the material particle. The unity of inertia and gravi-
THE GENERAL THEORY 87
tation is formally expressed by the fact that the whole left-hand
side of (90) has the character of a tensor (with respect to any
transformation of co-ordinates), but the two terms taken separately
do not have tensor character, so that, in analogy with
Newton’s equations, the first term would be regarded as the expression
for inertia, and the second as the expression for the
gravitational force.
We must next attempt to find the laws of the gravitational
field. For this purpose, Poisson’s equation,
?f = 4pK?
of the Newtonian theory must serve as a model. This equation
has its foundation in the idea that the gravitational field
arises from the density ? of ponderable matter. It must also
be so in the general theory of relativity. But our investigations
of the special theory of relativity have shown that in place of
the scalar density of matter we have the tensor of energy per
unit volume. In the latter is included not only the tensor of
the energy of ponderable matter, but also that of the electromagnetic
energy. We have seen, indeed, that in a more complete
analysis the energy tensor can be regarded only as a provisional
means of representing matter. In reality, matter consists of electrically
charged particles, and is to be regarded itself as a part,
in fact, the principal part, of the electromagnetic field. It is
only the circumstance that we have not sufficient knowledge of
the electromagnetic field of concentrated charges that compels
us, provisionally, to leave undetermined in presenting the theory,
the true form of this tensor. From this point of view our
problem now is to introduce a tensor, Tµ?, of the second rank,
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 88
whose structure we do not know provisionally, and which includes
in itself the energy density of the electromagnetic field
and of ponderable matter; we shall denote this in the following
as the “energy tensor of matter.”
According to our previous results, the principles of momentum
and energy are expressed by the statement that the divergence
of this tensor vanishes (47c). In the general theory of relativity,
we shall have to assume as valid the corresponding general
co-variant equation. If (Tµ?) denotes the co-variant energy tensor
of matter, T
?
s
the corresponding mixed tensor density, then,
in accordance with (83), we must require that
0 =
? T
a
s
?xa
- G
a
sß T

(95)
be satisfied. It must be remembered that besides the energy density
of the matter there must also be given an energy density of
the gravitational field, so that there can be no talk of principles
of conservation of energy and momentum for matter alone. This
is expressed mathematically by the presence of the second term
in (95), which makes it impossible to conclude the existence of
an integral equation of the form of (49). The gravitational field
transfers energy and momentum to the “matter,” in that it exerts
forces upon it and gives it energy; this is expressed by the
second term in (95).
If there is an analogue of Poisson’s equation in the general
theory of relativity, then this equation must be a tensor equation
for the tensor gµ? of the gravitational potential; the energy
tensor of matter must appear on the right-hand side of this
equation. On the left-hand side of the equation there must be
a differential tensor in the gµ?. We have to find this differen-
THE GENERAL THEORY 89
tial tensor. It is completely determined by the following three
conditions:—
1. It may contain no differential coefficients of the gµ? higher
than the second.
2. It must be linear and homogeneous in these second differential
coefficients.
3. Its divergence must vanish identically.
The first two of these conditions are naturally taken from
Poisson’s equation. Since it may be proved mathematically
that all such differential tensors can be formed algebraically
(i.e. without differentiation) from Riemann’s tensor, our tensor
must be of the form
Rµ? + agµ?R,
in which Rµ? and R are defined by (88) and (89) respectively.
Further, it may be proved that the third condition requires a
to have the value -
1
2
. For the law of the gravitational field we
therefore get the equation
Rµ? -
1
2
gµ?R = -?Tµ?. (96)
Equation (95) is a consequence of this equation. ? denotes a
constant, which is connected with the Newtonian gravitation
constant.
In the following I shall indicate the features of the theory
which are interesting from the point of view of physics, using as
little as possible of the rather involved mathematical method.
It must first be shown that the divergence of the left-hand side
actually vanishes. The energy principle for matter may be expressed,
by (83),

The analogous operation, applied to the left-hand side of (96),
will lead to an identity.
In the region surrounding each world-point there are systems
of co-ordinates for which, choosing the x4-co-ordinate imaginary,
at the given point,
gµ? = g
µ? = -dµ? =
(
-1 if µ = ?,
0 if µ 6= ?,
and for which the first derivatives of the gµ? and the g
µ? vanish.
We shall verify the vanishing of the divergence of the left-hand
side at this point. At this point the components Ga
sß vanish, so
that we have to prove the vanishing only of
?
?xs
v
-g g?s(Rµ? -
1
2
gµ?R)

.
Introducing (88) and (70) into this expression, we see that the
only terms that remain are those in which third derivatives of
the g
µ? enter. Since the gµ? are to be replaced by -dµ?, we obtain,
finally, only a few terms which may easily be seen to cancel
each other. Since the quantity that we have formed has a tensor
character, its vanishing is proved for every other system of coordinates
also, and naturally for every other four-dimensional
point. The energy principle of matter (97) is thus a mathematical
consequence of the field equations (96).
In order to learn whether the equations (96) are consistent
with experience, we must, above all else, find out whether they
THE GENERAL THEORY 91
lead to the Newtonian theory as a first approximation. For this
purpose we must introduce various approximations into these
equations. We already know that Euclidean geometry and the
law of the constancy of the velocity of light are valid, to a certain
approximation, in regions of a great extent, as in the planetary
system. If, as in the special theory of relativity, we take the
fourth co-ordinate imaginary, this means that we must put
gµ? = -dµ? + ?µ?, (98)
in which the ?µ? are so small compared to 1 that we can neglect
the higher powers of the ?µ? and their derivatives. If we do this,
we learn nothing about the structure of the gravitational field, or
of metrical space of cosmical dimensions, but we do learn about
the influence of neighbouring masses upon physical phenomena.
Before carrying through this approximation we shall transform
(96). We multiply (96) by g
µ?, summed over the µ and ?;
observing the relation which follows from the definition of
the g
µ?
,
gµ?g
µ? = 4,
we obtain the equation
R = ?gµ?Tµ? = ?T.
If we put this value of R in (96) we obtain
Rµ? = -?(Tµ? -

gµ?T) = -?T*

When the approximation which has been mentioned is carried
out, we obtain for the left-hand side,

We must now note that equation (96) is valid for any system
of co-ordinates. We have already specialized the system of
co-ordinates in that we have chosen it so that within the region
considered the gµ? differ infinitely little from the constant values
-dµ?. But this condition remains satisfied in any infinitesimal
change of co-ordinates, so that there are still four conditions
to which the ?µ? may be subjected, provided these conditions
do not conflict with the conditions for the order of magnitude of
the ?µ?. We shall now assume that the system of co-ordinates
is so chosen that the four relations—

THE GENERAL THEORY 93
In order to see in what sense this theory contains the Newtonian
theory, we must consider in greater detail the energy
tensor of matter. Considered phenomenologically, this energy
tensor is composed of that of the electromagnetic field and of
matter in the narrower sense. If we consider the different parts
of this energy tensor with respect to their order of magnitude,
it follows from the results of the special theory of relativity that
the contribution of the electromagnetic field practically vanishes
in comparison to that of ponderable matter. In our system of
units, the energy of one gram of matter is equal to 1, compared
to which the energy of the electric fields may be ignored, and
also the energy of deformation of matter, and even the chemical
energy. We get an approximation that is fully sufficient for our
purpose if we put
T
µ? = s
dxµ
ds
dx?
ds ,
ds2 = gµ? dxµ dx?.
?
?
?
(102)
In this, s is the density at rest, that is, the density of the ponderable
matter, in the ordinary sense, measured with the aid
of a unit measuring rod, and referred to a Galilean system of
co-ordinates moving with the matter.
We observe, further, that in the co-ordinates we have chosen,
we shall make only a relatively small error if we replace the gµ?
by -dµ?, so that we put
ds2 = -
Xdxµ
2
. (102a)
The previous developments are valid however rapidly the
masses which generate the field may move relatively to our chosen
system of quasi-Galilean co-ordinates. But in astronomy
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 94
we have to do with masses whose velocities, relatively to the
co-ordinate system employed, are always small compared to the
velocity of light, that is, small compared to 1, with our choice
of the unit of time. We therefore get an approximation which is
sufficient for nearly all practical purposes if in (101) we replace
the retarded potential by the ordinary (non-retarded) potential,
and if, for the masses which generate the field, we put
dx1
ds =
dx2
ds =
dx3
ds = 0,
dx4
ds =
v
-1 dl
dl =

Then we get for T

while all the other ?µ? vanish. The least of these equations,

We see that the Newtonian gravitation constant K, is connected
with the constant ? that enters into our field equations by the
relation
K =
?c2
8p
. (105)
From the known numerical value of K, it therefore follows that
? =
8pK
c
2
=
8p · 6.67 · 10-8
9 · 1020 = 1.86 · 10-27
. (105a)
From (101) we see that even in the first approximation the structure
of the gravitational field differs fundamentally from that
which is consistent with the Newtonian theory; this difference
lies in the fact that the gravitational potential has the character
of a tensor and not a scalar. This was not recognized in the past
because only the component g44, to a first approximation, enters
the equations of motion of material particles.
In order now to be able to judge the behaviour of measuring
rods and clocks from our results, we must observe the following.
According to the principle of equivalence, the metrical relations
of the Euclidean geometry are valid relatively to a Cartesian
system of reference of infinitely small dimensions, and in a suitable
state of motion (freely falling, and without rotation). We
can make the same statement for local systems of co-ordinates
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 96
which, relatively to these, have small accelerations, and therefore
for such systems of co-ordinates as are at rest relatively to
the one we have selected. For such a local system, we have, for
two neighbouring point events,
ds2 = -dX1
2 - dX2
2 - dX3
2 + dT2 = -dS2 + dT2
,
where dS is measured directly by a measuring rod and dT by
a clock at rest relatively to the system; these are the naturally
measured lengths and times. Since ds2
, on the other hand, is
known in terms of the co-ordinates x? employed in finite regions,
in the form
ds2 = gµ? dxµ dx?,
we have the possibility of getting the relation between naturally
measured lengths and times, on the one hand, and the corresponding
differences of co-ordinates, on the other hand. As the
division into space and time is in agreement with respect to the
two systems of co-ordinates, so when we equate the two expressions
for ds2 we get two relations. If, by (101a), we put
ds2 = -

THE GENERAL THEORY 97
The unit measuring rod has therefore the length,
1 -
?
8p
Z
s dV0
r
in respect to the system of co-ordinates we have selected. The
particular system of co-ordinates we have selected insures that
this length shall depend only upon the place, and not upon the
direction. If we had chosen a different system of co-ordinates
this would not be so. But however we may choose a system of
co-ordinates, the laws of configuration of rigid rods do not agree
with those of Euclidean geometry; in other words, we cannot
choose any system of co-ordinates so that the co-ordinate differences,
?x1, ?x2, ?x3, corresponding to the ends of a unit measuring
rod, oriented in any way, shall always satisfy the relation
?x1
2 + ?x2
2 + ?x3
2 = 1. In this sense space is not Euclidean,
but “curved.” It follows from the second of the relations above
that the interval between two beats of the unit clock (dT = 1)
corresponds to the “time”
1 +
?
8p
Z
s dV0
r
in the unit used in our system of co-ordinates. The rate of a
clock is accordingly slower the greater is the mass of the ponderable
matter in its neighbourhood. We therefore conclude that
spectral lines which are produced on the sun’s surface will be
displaced towards the red, compared to the corresponding lines
produced on the earth, by about 2 · 10-6 of their wave-lengths.
At first, this important consequence of the theory appeared to
conflict with experiment; but results obtained during the past
year seem to make the existence of this effect more probable, and
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 98
it can hardly be doubted that this consequence of the theory will
be confirmed within the next year.
Another important consequence of the theory, which can be
tested experimentally, has to do with the path of rays of light.
In the general theory of relativity also the velocity of light is
everywhere the same, relatively to a local inertial system. This
velocity is unity in our natural measure of time. The law of
the propagation of light in general co-ordinates is therefore, according
to the general theory of relativity, characterized, by the
equation
ds2 = 0.
To within the approximation which we are using, and in the
system of co-ordinates which we have selected, the velocity of
light is characterized, according to (106), by the equation


) = 

The velocity of light L, is therefore expressed in our co-ordinates

2 + dx3

dl = 1 -
?
4p

s dV0

. (107)
We can therefore draw the conclusion from this, that a ray of
light passing near a large mass is deflected. If we imagine the
sun, of mass M concentrated at the origin of our system of coordinates,
then a ray of light, travelling parallel to the x3-axis,
in the x1-x3 plane, at a distance ? from the origin, will be
deflected, in all, by an amount
a =

THE GENERAL THEORY 99
towards the sun. On performing the integration we get
a =
?M
2p?
. (108)
The existence of this deflection, which amounts to 1.7
00 for
? equal to the radius of the sun, was confirmed, with remarkable
accuracy, by the English Solar Eclipse Expedition in 1919, and
most careful preparations have been made to get more exact
observational data at the solar eclipse in 1922. It should be
noted that this result, also, of the theory is not influenced by
our arbitrary choice of a system of co-ordinates.
This is the place to speak of the third consequence of the
theory which can be tested by observation, namely, that which
concerns the motion of the perihelion of the planet Mercury. The
secular changes in the planetary orbits are known with such accuracy
that the approximation we have been using is no longer
sufficient for a comparison of theory and observation. It is necessary
to go back to the general field equations (96). To solve
this problem I made use of the method of successive approximations.
Since then, however, the problem of the central symmetrical
statical gravitational field has been completely solved by
Schwarzschild and others; the derivation given by H. Weyl in his
book, “Raum-Zeit-Materie,” is particularly elegant. The calculation
can be simplified somewhat if we do not go back directly
to the equation (96), but base it upon a principle of variation
that is equivalent to this equation. I shall indicate the procedure
only in so far as is necessary for understanding the method.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 100
In the case of a statical field, ds2 must have the form

ds2 =

?aß dxa dxß,
?
?
?
(109)
where the summation on the right-hand side of the last equation
is to be extended over the space variables only. The central
symmetry of the field requires the ?µ? to be of the form,
?aß = µdaß + ?xaxß; (110)
f
2
, µ and ? are functions of r =
v
x1
2 + x2
2 + x3
2 only. One
of these three functions can be chosen arbitrarily, because our
system of co-ordinates is, a priori, completely arbitrary; for by
a substitution
x

4 = x4,
x
0
a = F(r)xa,
we can always insure that one of these three functions shall be
an assigned function of r
0
. In place of (110) we can therefore
put, without limiting the generality,
?aß = daß + ?xaxß. (110a)
In this way the gµ? are expressed in terms of the two quantities
? and f. These are to be determined as functions of r,
by introducing them into equation (96), after first calculating

In (109c), (111) and (112) we have three equations between
the four variables s, r, l and f, from which the motion of the
planet may be calculated in the same way as in classical mechanics.
The most important result we get from this is a secular
rotation of the elliptic orbit of the planet in the same sense as
the revolution of the planet, amounting in radians per revolution

This expression furnishes the explanation of the motion of the
perihelion of the planet Mercury, which has been known for a
hundred years (since Leverrier), and for which theoretical astronomy
has hitherto been unable satisfactorily to account.
There is no difficulty in expressing Maxwell’s theory of the
electromagnetic field in terms of the general theory of relativity;
this is done by application of the tensor formation (81), (82)
and (77). Let fµ be a tensor of the first rank, to be denoted
as an electromagnetic 4-potential; then an electromagnetic field
tensor may be defined by the relations,
fµ? =
?fµ
?x?
-
?f?
?xµ
. (114)

the tensor equation, resulting from this,
?fµ?

If we introduce the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field
into the right-hand side of (96), we obtain (115), for the special
case J
µ = 0, as a consequence of (96) by taking the divergence.
This inclusion of the theory of electricity in the scheme of the
general theory of relativity has been considered arbitrary and
unsatisfactory by many theoreticians. Nor can we in this way
conceive of the equilibrium of the electricity which constitutes
the elementary electrically charged particles. A theory in which
the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field enter as an
essential entity would be much preferable. H. Weyl, and recently
Th. Kaluza, have discovered some ingenious theorems along this
direction; but concerning them, I am convinced that they do not
bring us nearer to the true solution of the fundamental problem.
I shall not go into this further, but shall give a brief discussion
of the so-called cosmological problem, for without this, the considerations
regarding the general theory of relativity would, in
a certain sense, remain unsatisfactory.
Our previous considerations, based upon the field equations
(96), had for a foundation the conception that space on
the whole is Galilean-Euclidean, and that this character is disturbed
only by masses embedded in it. This conception was
certainly justified as long as we were dealing with spaces of the
order of magnitude of those that astronomy has to do with.
But whether portions of the universe, however large they may
be, are quasi-Euclidean, is a wholly different question. We can
THE GENERAL THEORY 105
make this clear by using an example from the theory of surfaces
which we have employed many times. If a portion of a surface
is observed by the eye to be practically plane, it does not at all
follow that the whole surface has the form of a plane; the surface
might just as well be a sphere, for example, of sufficiently large
radius. The question as to whether the universe as a whole is
non-Euclidean was much discussed from the geometrical point of
view before the development of the theory of relativity. But with
the theory of relativity, this problem has entered upon a new
stage, for according to this theory the geometrical properties of
bodies are not independent, but depend upon the distribution
of masses.
If the universe were quasi-Euclidean, then Mach was wholly
wrong in his thought that inertia, as well as gravitation, depends
upon a kind of mutual action between bodies. For in this case,
with a suitably selected system of co-ordinates, the gµ? would
be constant at infinity, as they are in the special theory of relativity,
while within finite regions the gµ? would differ from these
constant values by small amounts only, with a suitable choice
of co-ordinates, as a result of the influence of the masses in fi-
nite regions. The physical properties of space would not then be
wholly independent, that is, uninfluenced by matter, but in the
main they would be, and only in small measure, conditioned by
matter. Such a dualistic conception is even in itself not satisfactory;
there are, however, some important physical arguments
against it, which we shall consider.
The hypothesis that the universe is infinite and Euclidean
at infinity, is, from the relativistic point of view, a complicated
hypothesis. In the language of the general theory of relativity
it demands that the Riemann tensor of the fourth rank Riklm
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 106
shall vanish at infinity, which furnishes twenty independent conditions,
while only ten curvature components Rµ?, enter into
the laws of the gravitational field. It is certainly unsatisfactory
to postulate such a far-reaching limitation without any physical
basis for it.
But in the second place, the theory of relativity makes it
appear probable that Mach was on the right road in his thought
that inertia depends upon a mutual action of matter. For we
shall show in the following that, according to our equations, inert
masses do act upon each other in the sense of the relativity of
inertia, even if only very feebly. What is to be expected along
the line of Mach’s thought?
1. The inertia of a body must increase when ponderable
masses are piled up in its neighbourhood.
2. A body must experience an accelerating force when
neighbouring masses are accelerated, and, in fact, the
force must be in the same direction as the acceleration.
3. A rotating hollow body must generate inside of itself
a “Coriolis field,” which deflects moving bodies in the
sense of the rotation, and a radial centrifugal field as
well.
We shall now show that these three effects, which are to be
expected in accordance with Mach’s ideas, are actually present
according to our theory, although their magnitude is so small
that confirmation of them by laboratory experiments is not to be
thought of. For this purpose we shall go back to the equations of
motion of a material particle (90), and carry the approximations
somewhat further than was done in equation (90a).
THE GENERAL THEORY 107
First, we consider ?44 as small of the first order. The square
of the velocity of masses moving under the influence of the gravitational
force is of the same order, according to the energy
equation. It is therefore logical to regard the velocities of the
material particles we are considering, as well as the velocities
of the masses which generate the field, as small, of the order 1
2
.
We shall now carry out the approximation in the equations that
arise from the field equations (101) and the equations of motion
(90) so far as to consider terms, in the second member
of (90), that are linear in those velocities. Further, we shall not
put ds and dl equal to each other, but, corresponding to the
higher approximation, we shall put
ds =
v
g44 dl =

(118)
The equations of motion, (118), show now, in fact, that
1. The inert mass is proportional to 1 + s, and therefore
increases when ponderable masses approach the test
body.
2. There is an inductive action of accelerated masses,
of the same sign, upon the test body. This is the
term
? A
?l .
THE GENERAL THEORY 109
3. A material particle, moving perpendicularly to the axis
of rotation inside a rotating hollow body, is deflected in
the sense of the rotation (Coriolis field). The centrifugal
action, mentioned above, inside a rotating hollow
body, also follows from the theory, as has been shown
by Thirring.*
Although all of these effects are inaccessible to experiment,
because ? is so small, nevertheless they certainly exist according
to the general theory of relativity. We must see in them a
strong support for Mach’s ideas as to the relativity of all inertial
actions. If we think these ideas consistently through to the end
we must expect the whole inertia, that is, the whole gµ?-field, to
be determined by the matter of the universe, and not mainly by
the boundary conditions at infinity.
For a satisfactory conception of the gµ?-field of cosmical dimensions,
the fact seems to be of significance that the relative
velocity of the stars is small compared to the velocity of light.
It follows from this that, with a suitable choice of co-ordinates,
g44 is nearly constant in the universe, at least, in that part of
the universe in which there is matter. The assumption appears
natural, moreover, that there are stars in all parts of the universe,
so that we may well assume that the inconstancy of g44 depends
only upon the circumstance that matter is not distributed
continuously, but is concentrated in single celestial bodies and
systems of bodies. If we are willing to ignore these more local
*That the centrifugal action must be inseparably connected with the
existence of the Coriolis field may be recognized, even without calculation,
in the special case of a co-ordinate system rotating uniformly relatively to
an inertial system; our general co-variant equations naturally must apply
to such a case.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 110
non-uniformities of the density of matter and of the gµ?-field, in
order to learn something of the geometrical properties of the universe
as a whole, it appears natural to substitute for the actual
distribution of masses a continuous distribution, and furthermore
to assign to this distribution a uniform density s. In this
imagined universe all points with space directions will be geometrically
equivalent; with respect to its space extension it will
have a constant curvature, and will be cylindrical with respect
to its x4-co-ordinate. The possibility seems to be particularly
satisfying that the universe is spatially bounded and thus, in
accordance with our assumption of the constancy of s, is of
constant curvature, being either spherical or elliptical; for then
the boundary conditions at infinity which are so inconvenient
from the standpoint of the general theory of relativity, may be
replaced by the much more natural conditions for a closed surface.
According to what has been said, we are to put
ds2 = dx4
2 - ?µ? dxµ dx?, (119)
in which the indices µ and ? run from 1 to 3 only. The ?µ?
will be such functions of x1, x2, x3 as correspond to a threedimensional
continuum of constant positive curvature. We must
now investigate whether such an assumption can satisfy the field
equations of gravitation.
In order to be able to investigate this, we must first find
what differential conditions the three-dimensional manifold of
constant curvature satisfies. A spherical manifold of three dimensions,
embedded in a Euclidean continuum of four dimen-

By eliminating x4, we get

As far as terms of the third and higher degrees in the x?, we
can put, in the neighbourhood of the origin of co-ordinates,
ds2 =

dµ? +
xµx?

dxµ dx?.
Inside the brackets are the gµ? of the manifold in the neighbourhood
of the origin. Since the first derivatives of the gµ?,
and therefore also the Gs
µ?, vanish at the origin, the calculation
of the Rµ? for this manifold, by (88), is very simple at the origin.
We have
Rµ? = -
2
a
2
dµ? =

gµ?.
Since the relation Rµ? =
2
a

gµ? is universally co-variant,
and since all points of the manifold are geometrically equivalent,
this relation holds for every system of co-ordinates, and
everywhere in the manifold. In order to avoid confusion with

that of a mathematical artifice.

the four-dimensional continuum, we shall, in the following, designate
quantities that refer to the three-dimensional continuum
by Greek letters, and put
Pµ? = -
2
a
2
?µ?. (120)
We now proceed to apply the field equations (96) to our special
case. From (119) we get for the four-dimensional manifold,
Rµ? = Pµ? for the indices 1 to 3,
R14 = R24 = R34 = R44 = 0.
)
(121)
For the right-hand side of (96) we have to consider the energy
tensor for matter distributed like a cloud of dust. According to
what has gone before we must therefore put
T
µ? = s
dxµ
ds

specialized for the case of rest. But in addition, we shall add
a pressure term that may be physically established as follows.
Matter consists of electrically charged particles. On the basis
of Maxwell’s theory these cannot be conceived of as electromagnetic
fields free from singularities. In order to be consistent
with the facts, it is necessary to introduce energy terms, not
contained in Maxwell’s theory, so that the single electric particles
may hold together in spite of the mutual repulsions between
their elements, charged with electricity of one sign. For the sake
of consistency with this fact, Poincar´e has assumed a pressure
to exist inside these particles which balances the electrostatic
repulsion. It cannot, however, be asserted that this pressure
THE GENERAL THEORY 113
vanishes outside the particles. We shall be consistent with this
circumstance if, in our phenomenological presentation, we add
a pressure term. This must not, however, be confused with a
hydrodynamical pressure, as it serves only for the energetic presentation
of the dynamical relations inside matter. In this sense
we put
Tµ? = gµsg?ß
dxa
ds
dxß
ds - gµ?p. (122)
In our special case we have, therefore, to put
Tµ? = ?µ?p (for µ and ? from 1 to 3),
T44 = s - p,
T = -?
µ??µ?p + s - p = s - 4p.
Observing that the field equation (96) may be written in the
form
Rµ? = -?(Tµ? -
1
2
gµ?T),
we get from (96) the equations,
+

From this follows
p = -

(123)
If the universe is quasi-Euclidean, and its radius of curvature
therefore infinite, then s would vanish. But it is improbable that
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY 114
the mean density of matter in the universe is actually zero; this
is our third argument against the assumption that the universe
is quasi-Euclidean. Nor does it seem possible that our hypothetical
pressure can vanish; the physical nature of this pressure can
be appreciated only after we have a better theoretical knowledge
of the electromagnetic field. According to the second of equations
(123) the radius, a, of the universe is determined in terms
of the total mass, M, of matter, by the equation
a =
M?
4p
2
. (124)
The complete dependence of the geometrical upon the physical
properties becomes clearly apparent by means of this equation.
Thus we may present the following arguments against the
conception of a space-infinite, and for the conception of a spacebounded,
universe:—
1. From the standpoint of the theory of relativity, the condition
for a closed surface is very much simpler than the corresponding
boundary condition at infinity of the quasi-Euclidean
structure of the universe.
2. The idea that Mach expressed, that inertia depends upon
the mutual action of bodies, is contained, to a first approximation,
in the equations of the theory of relativity; it follows
from these equations that inertia depends, at least in part, upon
mutual actions between masses. As it is an unsatisfactory assumption
to make that inertia depends in part upon mutual
actions, and in part upon an independent property of space,
Mach’s idea gains in probability. But this idea of Mach’s corresponds
only to a finite universe, bounded in space, and not to a
quasi-Euclidean, infinite universe. From the standpoint of epis-
THE GENERAL THEORY 115
temology it is more satisfying to have the mechanical properties
of space completely determined by matter, and this is the case
only in a space-bounded universe.
3. An infinite universe is possible only if the mean density of
matter in the universe vanishes. Although such an assumption
is logically possible, it is less probable than the assumption that
there is a finite mean density of matter in the universe.

VICE-PRESIDENT AND PROFESSOR OF GREEK
IN QUEEN’S COLLEGE, CORK,
THIS WORK IS INSCRIBED
IN TESTIMONY OF FRIENDSHIP AND ESTEEM
PREFACE.
——
The following work is not a republication of a former treatise by the Author,
entitled, “The Mathematical Analysis of Logic.” Its earlier portion is indeed
devoted to the same object, and it begins by establishing the same system of
fundamental laws, but its methods are more general, and its range of applications
far wider. It exhibits the results, matured by some years of study and
reflection, of a principle of investigation relating to the intellectual operations,
the previous exposition of which was written within a few weeks after its idea
had been conceived.
That portion of this work which relates to Logic presupposes in its reader a
knowledge of the most important terms of the science, as usually treated, and
of its general object. On these points there is no better guide than Archbishop
Whately’s “Elements of Logic,” or Mr. Thomson’s “Outlines of the Laws of
Thought.” To the former of these treatises, the present revival of attention to
this class of studies seems in a great measure due. Some acquaintance with the
principles of Algebra is also requisite, but it is not necessary that this application
should have been carried beyond the solution of simple equations. For the study
of those chapters which relate to the theory of probabilities, a somewhat larger
knowledge of Algebra is required, and especially of the doctrine of Elimination,
and of the solution of Equations containing more than one unknown quantity.
Preliminary information upon the subject-matter will be found in the special
treatises on Probabilities in “Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopædia,” and the “Library
of Useful Knowledge,” the former of these by Professor De Morgan, the latter
by Sir John Lubbock; and in an interesting series of Letters translated from
the French of M. Quetelet. Other references will be given in the work. On
a first perusal the reader may omit at his discretion, Chapters x., xiv., and
xix., together with any of the applications which he may deem uninviting or
irrelevant.
In different parts of the work, and especially in the notes to the concluding
chapter, will be found references to various writers, ancient and modern, chiefly
designed to illustrate a certain view of the history of philosophy. With respect
to these, the Author thinks it proper to add, that he has in no instance given
iii
PREFACE. iv
a citation which he has not believed upon careful examination to be supported
either by parallel authorities, or by the general tenor of the work from which
it was taken. While he would gladly have avoided the introduction of anything
which might by possibility be construed into the parade of learning, he felt it
to be due both to his subject and to the truth, that the statements in the text
should be accompanied by the means of verification. And if now, in bringing
to its close a labour, of the extent of which few persons will be able to judge
from its apparent fruits, he may be permitted to speak for a single moment
of the feelings with which he has pursued, and with which he now lays aside,
his task, he would say, that he never doubted that it was worthy of his best
efforts; that he felt that whatever of truth it might bring to light was not a
private or arbitrary thing, not dependent, as to its essence, upon any human
opinion. He was fully aware that learned and able men maintained opinions
upon the subject of Logic directly opposed to the views upon which the entire
argument and procedure of his work rested. While he believed those opinions to
be erroneous, he was conscious that his own views might insensibly be warped
by an influence of another kind. He felt in an especial manner the danger of that
intellectual bias which long attention to a particular aspect of truth tends to
produce. But he trusts that out of this conflict of opinions the same truth will
but emerge the more free from any personal admixture; that its different parts
will be seen in their just proportion; and that none of them will eventually be
too highly valued or too lightly regarded because of the prejudices which may
attach to the mere form of its exposition.
To his valued friend, the Rev. George Stephens Dickson, of Lincoln, the
Author desires to record his obligations for much kind assistance in the revision
of this work, and for some important suggestions.

NOTE.
In Prop. II., p. 261, by the “absolute probabilities” of the events x, y, z.. is
meant simply what the probabilities of those events ought to be, in order that,
regarding them as independent, and their probabilities as our only data, the
calculated probabilities of the same events under the condition V should be
p, g, r.. The statement of the appended problem of the urn must be modified
in a similar way. The true solution of that problem, as actually stated, is
p
0 = cp, q0 = cq, in which c is the arbitrary probability of the condition that
the ball drawn shall be either white, or of marble, or both at once.–See p. 270,
CASE II.*
Accordingly, since by the logical reduction the solution of all questions in
the theory of probabilities is brought to a form in which, from the probabilities
of simple events, s, t, &c. under a given condition, V , it is required to
determine the probability of some combination, A, of those events under the
same condition, the principle of the demonstration in Prop. IV. is really the
following:–“The probability of such combination A under the condition V must
be calculated as if the events s, t, &c. were independent, and possessed of
such probabilities as would cause the derived probabilities of the said events
under the same condition V to be such as are assigned to them in the data.”
This principle I regard as axiomatic. At the same time it admits of indefinite
verification, as well directly as through the results of the method of which it
forms the basis. I think it right to add, that it was in the above form that the
principle first presented itself to my mind, and that it is thus that I have always
understood it, the error in the particular problem referred to having arisen from
inadvertence in the choice of a material illustration.

NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK.
1. The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of
those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression
to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to
establish the science of Logic and construct its method; to make that method
itself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical
doctrine of Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of
truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations
concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind.
2. That this design is not altogether a novel one it is almost needless to
remark, and it is well known that to its two main practical divisions of Logic
and Probabilities a very considerable share of the attention of philosophers has
been directed. In its ancient and scholastic form, indeed, the subject of Logic
stands almost exclusively associated with the great name of Aristotle. As it
was presented to ancient Greece in the partly technical, partly metaphysical
disquisitions of the Organon, such, with scarcely any essential change, it has
continued to the present day. The stream of original inquiry has rather been directed
towards questions of general philosophy, which, though they have arisen
among the disputes of the logicians, have outgrown their origin, and given to
successive ages of speculation their peculiar bent and character. The eras of
Porphyry and Proclus, of Anselm and Abelard, of Ramus, and of Descartes,
together with the final protests of Bacon and Locke, rise up before the mind
as examples of the remoter influences of the study upon the course of human
thought, partly in suggesting topics fertile of discussion, partly in provoking
remonstrance against its own undue pretensions. The history of the theory
of Probabilities, on the other hand, has presented far more of that character of
steady growth which belongs to science. In its origin the early genius of Pascal,–
in its maturer stages of development the most recondite of all the mathematical
speculations of Laplace,–were directed to its improvement; to omit here the
mention of other names scarcely less distinguished than these. As the study of
Logic has been remarkable for the kindred questions of Metaphysics to which
it has given occasion, so that of Probabilities also has been remarkable for the
impulse which it has bestowed upon the higher departments of mathematical
1
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 2
science. Each of these subjects has, moreover, been justly regarded as having
relation to a speculative as well as to a practical end. To enable us to deduce
correct inferences from given premises is not the only object of Logic; nor is it
the sole claim of the theory of Probabilities that it teaches us how to establish
the business of life assurance on a secure basis; and how to condense whatever
is valuable in the records of innumerable observations in astronomy, in physics,
or in that field of social inquiry which is fast assuming a character of great
importance. Both these studies have also an interest of another kind, derived
from the light which they shed upon the intellectual powers. They instruct us
concerning the mode in which language and number serve as instrumental aids
to the processes of reasoning; they reveal to us in some degree the connexion
between different powers of our common intellect; they set before us what, in
the two domains of demonstrative and of probable knowledge, are the essential
standards of truth and correctness,–standards not derived from without,
but deeply founded in the constitution of the human faculties. These ends of
speculation yield neither in interest nor in dignity, nor yet, it may be added, in
importance, to the practical objects, with the pursuit of which they have been
historically associated. To unfold the secret laws and relations of those high
faculties of thought by which all beyond the merely perceptive knowledge of the
world and of ourselves is attained or matured, is an object which does not stand
in need of commendation to a rational mind.
3. But although certain parts of the design of this work have been entertained
by others, its general conception, its method, and, to a considerable extent,
its results, are believed to be original. For this reason I shall offer, in the
present chapter, some preparatory statements and explanations, in order that
the real aim of this treatise may be understood, and the treatment of its subject
facilitated.
It is designed, in the first place, to investigate the fundamental laws of those
operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed. It is unnecessary to
enter here into any argument to prove that the operations of the mind are in
a certain real sense subject to laws, and that a science of the mind is therefore
possible. If these are questions which admit of doubt, that doubt is not to be
met by an endeavour to settle the point of dispute `a priori, but by directing
the attention of the objector to the evidence of actual laws, by referring him
to an actual science. And thus the solution of that doubt would belong not to
the introduction to this treatise, but to the treatise itself. Let the assumption
be granted, that a science of the intellectual powers is possible, and let us for a
moment consider how the knowledge of it is to be obtained.
4. Like all other sciences, that of the intellectual operations must primarily
rest upon observation,–the subject of such observation being the very operations
and processes of which we desire to determine the laws. But while the necessity
of a foundation in experience is thus a condition common to all sciences, there
are some special differences between the modes in which this principle becomes
available for the determination of general truths when the subject of inquiry is
the mind, and when the subject is external nature. To these it is necessary to
direct attention.
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 3
The general laws of Nature are not, for the most part, immediate objects
of perception. They are either inductive inferences from a large body of facts,
the common truth in which they express, or, in their origin at least, physical
hypotheses of a causal nature serving to explain phænomena with undeviating
precision, and to enable us to predict new combinations of them. They are in all
cases, and in the strictest sense of the term, probable conclusions, approaching,
indeed, ever and ever nearer to certainty, as they receive more and more of the
confirmation of experience. But of the character of probability, in the strict and
proper sense of that term, they are never wholly divested. On the other hand,
the knowledge of the laws of the mind does not require as its basis any extensive
collection of observations. The general truth is seen in the particular instance,
and it is not confirmed by the repetition of instances. We may illustrate this
position by an obvious example. It may be a question whether that formula of
reasoning, which is called the dictum of Aristotle, de omni et nullo, expresses a
primary law of human reasoning or not; but it is no question that it expresses a
general truth in Logic. Now that truth is made manifest in all its generality by
reflection upon a single instance of its application. And this is both an evidence
that the particular principle or formula in question is founded upon some general
law or laws of the mind, and an illustration of the doctrine that the perception
of such general truths is not derived from an induction from many instances, but
is involved in the clear apprehension of a single instance. In connexion with this
truth is seen the not less important one that our knowledge of the laws upon
which the science of the intellectual powers rests, whatever may be its extent or
its deficiency, is not probable knowledge. For we not only see in the particular
example the general truth, but we see it also as a certain truth,–a truth, our
confidence in which will not continue to increase with increasing experience of
its practical verifications.
5. But if the general truths of Logic are of such a nature that when presented
to the mind they at once command assent, wherein consists the difficulty of
constructing the Science of Logic? Not, it may be answered, in collecting the
materials of knowledge, but in discriminating their nature, and determining
their mutual place and relation. All sciences consist of general truths, but of
those truths some only are primary and fundamental, others are secondary and
derived. The laws of elliptic motion, discovered by Kepler, are general truths
in astronomy, but they are not its fundamental truths. And it is so also in
the purely mathematical sciences. An almost boundless diversity of theorems,
which are known, and an infinite possibility of others, as yet unknown, rest
together upon the foundation of a few simple axioms; and yet these are all
general truths. It may be added, that they are truths which to an intelligence
sufficiently refined would shine forth in their own unborrowed light, without
the need of those connecting links of thought, those steps of wearisome and
often painful deduction, by which the knowledge of them is actually acquired.
Let us define as fundamental those laws and principles from which all other
general truths of science may be deduced, and into which they may all be again
resolved. Shall we then err in regarding that as the true science of Logic which,
laying down certain elementary laws, confirmed by the very testimony of the
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 4
mind, permits us thence to deduce, by uniform processes, the entire chain of its
secondary consequences, and furnishes, for its practical applications, methods
of perfect generality? Let it be considered whether in any science, viewed either
as a system of truth or as the foundation of a practical art, there can properly
be any other test of the completeness and the fundamental character of its laws,
than the completeness of its system of derived truths, and the generality of
the methods which it serves to establish. Other questions may indeed present
themselves. Convenience, prescription, individual preference, may urge their
claims and deserve attention. But as respects the question of what constitutes
science in its abstract integrity, I apprehend that no other considerations than
the above are properly of any value.
6. It is designed, in the next place, to give expression in this treatise to the
fundamental laws of reasoning in the symbolical language of a Calculus. Upon
this head it will suffice to say, that those laws are such as to suggest this mode of
expression, and to give to it a peculiar and exclusive fitness for the ends in view.
There is not only a close analogy between the operations of the mind in general
reasoning and its operations in the particular science of Algebra, but there is to
a considerable extent an exact agreement in the laws by which the two classes of
operations are conducted. Of course the laws must in both cases be determined
independently; any formal agreement between them can only be established
`a posteriori by actual comparison. To borrow the notation of the science of
Number, and then assume that in its new application the laws by which its use is
governed will remain unchanged, would be mere hypothesis. There exist, indeed,
certain general principles founded in the very nature of language, by which the
use of symbols, which are but the elements of scientific language, is determined.
To a certain extent these elements are arbitrary. Their interpretation is purely
conventional: we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please. But
this permission is limited by two indispensable conditions,–first, that from the
sense once conventionally established we never, in the same process of reasoning,
depart; secondly, that the laws by which the process is conducted be founded
exclusively upon the above fixed sense or meaning of the symbols employed.
In accordance with these principles, any agreement which may be established
between the laws of the symbols of Logic and those of Algebra can but issue
in an agreement of processes. The two provinces of interpretation remain apart
and independent, each subject to its own laws and conditions.
Now the actual investigations of the following pages exhibit Logic, in its
practical aspect, as a system of processes carried on by the aid of symbols having
a definite interpretation, and subject to laws founded upon that interpretation
alone. But at the same time they exhibit those laws as identical in form with
the laws of the general symbols of algebra, with this single addition, viz., that
the symbols of Logic are further subject to a special law (Chap, II.), to which
the symbols of quantity, as such, are not subject. Upon the nature and the
evidence of this law it is not purposed here to dwell. These questions will be
fully discussed in a future page. But as constituting the essential ground of
difference between those forms of inference with which Logic is conversant, and
those which present themselves in the particular science of Number, the law in
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 5
question is deserving of more than a passing notice. It may be said that it lies at
the very foundation of general reasoning,–that it governs those intellectual acts
of conception or of imagination which are preliminary to the processes of logical
deduction, and that it gives to the processes themselves much of their actual
form and expression. It may hence be affirmed that this law constitutes the
germ or seminal principle, of which every approximation to a general method
in Logic is the more or less perfect development.
7. The principle has already been laid down (5) that the sufficiency and truly
fundamental character of any assumed system of laws in the science of Logic
must partly be seen in the perfection of the methods to which they conduct
us. It remains, then, to consider what the requirements of a general method in
Logic are, and how far they are fulfilled in the system of the present work.
Logic is conversant with two kinds of relations,–relations among things, and
relations among facts. But as facts are expressed by propositions, the latter
species of relation may, at least for the purposes of Logic, be resolved into a
relation among propositions. The assertion that the fact or event A is an invariable
consequent of the fact or event B may, to this extent at least, be regarded
as equivalent to the assertion, that the truth of the proposition affirming the occurrence
of the event B always implies the truth of the proposition affirming the
occurrence of the event A. Instead, then, of saying that Logic is conversant with
relations among things and relations among facts, we are permitted to say that
it is concerned with relations among things and relations among propositions.
Of the former kind of relations we have an example in the proposition–“All men
are mortal;” of the latter kind in the proposition–“If the sun is totally eclipsed,
the stars will become visible.” The one expresses a relation between “men” and
“mortal beings,” the other between the elementary propositions–“The sun is totally
eclipsed;” “The stars will become visible.” Among such relations I suppose
to be included those which affirm or deny existence with respect to things, and
those which affirm or deny truth with respect to propositions. Now let those
things or those propositions among which relation is expressed be termed the
elements of the propositions by which such relation is expressed. Proceeding
from this definition, we may then say that the premises of any logical argument
express given relations among certain elements, and that the conclusion must
express an implied relation among those elements, or among a part of them, i.e.
a relation implied by or inferentially involved in the premises.
8. Now this being premised, the requirements of a general method in Logic
seem to be the following:–
1st. As the conclusion must express a relation among the whole or among
a part of the elements involved in the premises, it is requisite that we should
possess the means of eliminating those elements which we desire not to appear
in the conclusion, and of determining the whole amount of relation implied by
the premises among the elements which we wish to retain. Those elements
which do not present themselves in the conclusion are, in the language of the
common Logic, called middle terms; and the species of elimination exemplified
in treatises on Logic consists in deducing from two propositions, containing a
common element or middle term, a conclusion connecting the two remaining
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 6
terms. But the problem of elimination, as contemplated in this work, possesses
a much wider scope. It proposes not merely the elimination of one middle
term from two propositions, but the elimination generally of middle terms from
propositions, without regard to the number of either of them, or to the nature
of their connexion. To this object neither the processes of Logic nor those of
Algebra, in their actual state, present any strict parallel. In the latter science
the problem of elimination is known to be limited in the following manner:–From
two equations we can eliminate one symbol of quantity; from three equations
two symbols; and, generally, from n equations n - 1 symbols. But though this
condition, necessary in Algebra, seems to prevail in the existing Logic also, it
has no essential place in Logic as a science. There, no relation whatever can be
proved to prevail between the number of terms to be eliminated and the number
of propositions from which the elimination is to be effected. From the equation
representing a single proposition, any number of symbols representing terms
or elements in Logic may be eliminated; and from any number of equations
representing propositions, one or any other number of symbols of this kind may
be eliminated in a similar manner. For such elimination there exists one general
process applicable to all cases. This is one of the many remarkable consequences
of that distinguishing law of the symbols of Logic, to which attention has been
already directed.
2ndly. It should be within the province of a general method in Logic to express
the final relation among the elements of the conclusion by any admissible
kind of proposition, or in any selected order of terms. Among varieties of kind
we may reckon those which logicians have designated by the terms categorical,
hypothetical, disjunctive, &c. To a choice or selection in the order of the terms,
we may refer whatsoever is dependent upon the appearance of particular elements
in the subject or in the predicate, in the antecedent or in the consequent,
of that proposition which forms the “conclusion.” But waiving the language of
the schools, let us consider what really distinct species of problems may present
themselves to our notice. We have seen that the elements of the final or inferred
relation may either be things or propositions. Suppose the former case; then
it might be required to deduce from the premises a definition or description of
some one thing, or class of things, constituting an element of the conclusion in
terms of the other things involved in it. Or we might form the conception of
some thing or class of things, involving more than one of the elements of the
conclusion, and require its expression in terms of the other elements. Again,
suppose the elements retained in the conclusion to be propositions, we might
desire to ascertain such points as the following, viz., Whether, in virtue of the
premises, any of those propositions, taken singly, are true or false?–Whether
particular combinations of them are true or false?–Whether, assuming a particular
proposition to be true, any consequences will follow, and if so, what
consequences, with respect to the other propositions?–Whether any particular
condition being assumed with reference to certain of the propositions, any consequences,
and what consequences, will follow with respect to the others? and so
on. I say that these are general questions, which it should fall within the scope
or province of a general method in Logic to solve. Perhaps we might include
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 7
them all under this one statement of the final problem of practical Logic. Given
a set of premises expressing relations among certain elements, whether things
or propositions: required explicitly the whole relation consequent among any of
those elements under any proposed conditions, and in any proposed form. That
this problem, under all its aspects, is resolvable, will hereafter appear. But it is
not for the sake of noticing this fact, that the above inquiry into the nature and
the functions of a general method in Logic has been introduced. It is necessary
that the reader should apprehend what are the specific ends of the investigation
upon which we are entering, as well as the principles which are to guide us to
the attainment of them.
9. Possibly it may here be said that the Logic of Aristotle, in its rules
of syllogism and conversion, sets forth the elementary processes of which all
reasoning consists, and that beyond these there is neither scope nor occasion
for a general method. I have no desire to point out the defects of the common
Logic, nor do I wish to refer to it any further than is necessary, in order to
place in its true light the nature of the present treatise. With this end alone in
view, I would remark:–1st. That syllogism, conversion, &c., are not the ultimate
processes of Logic. It will be shown in this treatise that they are founded upon,
and are resolvable into, ulterior and more simple processes which constitute the
real elements of method in Logic. Nor is it true in fact that all inference is
reducible to the particular forms of syllogism and conversion.–Vide Chap. xv.
2ndly. If all inference were reducible to these two processes (and it has been
maintained that it is reducible to syllogism alone), there would still exist the
same necessity for a general method. For it would still be requisite to determine
in what order the processes should succeed each other, as well as their particular
nature, in order that the desired relation should be obtained. By the desired
relation I mean that full relation which, in virtue of the premises, connects any
elements selected out of the premises at will, and which, moreover, expresses that
relation in any desired form and order. If we may judge from the mathematical
sciences, which are the most perfect examples of method known, this directive
function of Method constitutes its chief office and distinction. The fundamental
processes of arithmetic, for instance, are in themselves but the elements of a
possible science. To assign their nature is the first business of its method, but
to arrange their succession is its subsequent and higher function. In the more
complex examples of logical deduction, and especially in those which form a
basis for the solution of difficult questions in the theory of Probabilities, the aid
of a directive method, such as a Calculus alone can supply, is indispensable.
10. Whence it is that the ultimate laws of Logic are mathematical in their
form; why they are, except in a single point, identical with the general laws of
Number; and why in that particular point they differ;–are questions upon which
it might not be very remote from presumption to endeavour to pronounce a
positive judgment. Probably they lie beyond the reach of our limited faculties.
It may, perhaps, be permitted to the mind to attain a knowledge of the laws to
which it is itself subject, without its being also given to it to understand their
ground and origin, or even, except in a very limited degree, to comprehend their
fitness for their end, as compared with other and conceivable systems of law.
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 8
Such knowledge is, indeed, unnecessary for the ends of science, which properly
concerns itself with what is, and seeks not for grounds of preference or reasons
of appointment. These considerations furnish a sufficient answer to all protests
against the exhibition of Logic in the form of a Calculus. It is not because we
choose to assign to it such a mode of manifestation, but because the ultimate
laws of thought render that mode possible, and prescribe its character, and
forbid, as it would seem, the perfect manifestation of the science in any other
form, that such a mode demands adoption. It is to be remembered that it is the
business of science not to create laws, but to discover them. We do not originate
the constitution of our own minds, greatly as it may be in our power to modify
their character. And as the laws of the human intellect do not depend upon our
will, so the forms of the science, of which they constitute the basis, are in all
essential regards independent of individual choice.
11. Beside the general statement of the principles of the above method,
this treatise will exhibit its application to the analysis of a considerable variety
of propositions, and of trains of propositions constituting the premises
of demonstrative arguments. These examples have been selected from various
writers, they differ greatly in complexity, and they embrace a wide range of
subjects. Though in this particular respect it may appear to some that too
great a latitude of choice has been exercised, I do not deem it necessary to offer
any apology upon this account. That Logic, as a science, is susceptible of very
wide applications is admitted; but it is equally certain that its ultimate forms
and processes are mathematical. Any objection `a priori which may therefore
be supposed to lie against the adoption of such forms and processes in the discussion
of a problem of morals or of general philosophy must be founded upon
misapprehension or false analogy. It is not of the essence of mathematics to be
conversant with the ideas of number and quantity. Whether as a general habit
of mind it would be desirable to apply symbolical processes to moral argument,
is another question. Possibly, as I have elsewhere observed,1
the perfection of
the method of Logic may be chiefly valuable as an evidence of the speculative
truth of its principles. To supersede the employment of common reasoning, or
to subject it to the rigour of technical forms, would be the last desire of one
who knows the value of that intellectual toil and warfare which imparts to the
mind an athletic vigour, and teaches it to contend with difficulties, and to rely
upon itself in emergencies. Nevertheless, cases may arise in which the value of
a scientific procedure, even in those things which fall confessedly under the ordinary
dominion of the reason, may be felt and acknowledged. Some examples
of this kind will be found in the present work.
12. The general doctrine and method of Logic above explained form also
the basis of a theory and corresponding method of Probabilities. Accordingly,
the development of such a theory and method, upon the above principles, will
constitute a distinct object of the present treatise. Of the nature of this application
it may be desirable to give here some account, more especially as regards
the character of the solutions to which it leads. In connexion with this object
1Mathematical Analysis of Logic. London : G. Bell. 1847.
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 9
some further detail will be requisite concerning the forms in which the results
of the logical analysis are presented.
The ground of this necessity of a prior method in Logic, as the basis of a
theory of Probabilities, may be stated in a few words. Before we can determine
the mode in which the expected frequency of occurrence of a particular event is
dependent upon the known frequency of occurrence of any other events, we must
be acquainted with the mutual dependence of the events themselves. Speaking
technically, we must be able to express the event whose probability is sought,
as a function of the events whose probabilities are given. Now this explicit
determination belongs in all instances to the department of Logic. Probability,
however, in its mathematical acceptation, admits of numerical measurement.
Hence the subject of Probabilities belongs equally to the science of Number and
to that of Logic. In recognising the co-ordinate existence of both these elements,
the present treatise differs from all previous ones; and as this difference not
only affects the question of the possibility of the solution of problems in a large
number of instances, but also introduces new and important elements into the
solutions obtained, I deem it necessary to state here, at some length, the peculiar
consequences of the theory developed in the following pages.
13. The measure of the probability of an event is usually defined as a fraction,
of which the numerator represents the number of cases favourable to the event,
and the denominator the whole number of cases favourable and unfavourable;
all cases being supposed equally likely to happen. That definition is adopted
in the present work. At the same time it is shown that there is another aspect
of the subject (shortly to be referred to) which might equally be regarded as
fundamental, and which would actually lead to the same system of methods
and conclusions. It may be added, that so far as the received conclusions of
the theory of Probabilities extend, and so far as they are consequences of its
fundamental definitions, they do not differ from the results (supposed to be
equally correct in inference) of the method of this work.
Again, although questions in the theory of Probabilities present themselves
under various aspects, and may be variously modified by algebraical and other
conditions, there seems to be one general type to which all such questions, or
so much of each of them as truly belongs to the theory of Probabilities, may
be referred. Considered with reference to the data and the quæsitum, that type
may be described as follows:—1st. The data are the probabilities of one or
more given events, each probability being either that of the absolute fulfilment
of the event to which it relates, or the probability of its fulfilment under given
supposed conditions. 2ndly. The quæsitum, or object sought, is the probability
of the fulfilment, absolutely or conditionally, of some other event differing in
expression from those in the data, but more or less involving the same elements.
As concerns the data, they are either causally given,—as when the probability
of a particular throw of a die is deduced from a knowledge of the constitution
of the piece,—or they are derived from observation of repeated instances of the
success or failure of events. In the latter case the probability of an event may be
defined as the limit toward which the ratio of the favourable to the whole number
of observed cases approaches (the uniformity of nature being presupposed) as
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 10
the observations are indefinitely continued. Lastly, as concerns the nature or
relation of the events in question, an important distinction remains. Those
events are either simple or compound. By a compound event is meant one of
which the expression in language, or the conception in thought, depends upon
the expression or the conception of other events, which, in relation to it, may be
regarded as simple events. To say “it rains,” or to say “it thunders,” is to express
the occurrence of a simple event; but to say “it rains and thunders,” or to say
“it either rains or thunders,” is to express that of a compound event. For the
expression of that event depends upon the elementary expressions, “it rains,”
“it thunders.” The criterion of simple events is not, therefore, any supposed
simplicity in their nature. It is founded solely on the mode of their expression
in language or conception in thought.
14. Now one general problem, which the existing theory of Probabilities
enables us to solve, is the following, viz.:—Given the probabilities of any simple
events: required the probability of a given compound event, i.e. of an event
compounded in a given manner out of the given simple events. The problem
can also be solved when the compound event, whose probability is required, is
subjected to given conditions, i.e. to conditions dependent also in a given manner
on the given simple events. Beside this general problem, there exist also
particular problems of which the principle of solution is known. Various questions
relating to causes and effects can be solved by known methods under the
particular hypothesis that the causes are mutually exclusive, but apparently not
otherwise. Beyond this it is not clear that any advance has been made toward
the solution of what may be regarded as the general problem of the science,
viz.: Given the probabilities of any events, simple or compound, conditioned
or unconditioned: required the probability of any other event equally arbitrary
in expression and conception. In the statement of this question it is not even
postulated that the events whose probabilities are given, and the one whose
probability is sought, should involve some common elements, because it is the
office of a method to determine whether the data of a problem are sufficient for
the end in view, and to indicate, when they are not so, wherein the deficiency
consists.
This problem, in the most unrestricted form of its statement, is resolvable by
the method of the present treatise; or, to speak more precisely, its theoretical
solution is completely given, and its practical solution is brought to depend
only upon processes purely mathematical, such as the resolution and analysis
of equations. The order and character of the general solution may be thus
described.
15. In the first place it is always possible, by the preliminary method of the
Calculus of Logic, to express the event whose probability is sought as a logical
function of the events whose probabilities are given. The result is of the following
character: Suppose that X represents the event whose probability is sought, A,
B, C, &c. the events whose probabilities are given, those events being either
simple or compound. Then the whole relation of the event X to the events A,
B, C, &c. is deduced in the form of what mathematicians term a development,
consisting, in the most general case, of four distinct classes of terms. By the
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 11
first class are expressed those combinations of the events A, B, C, which both
necessarily accompany and necessarily indicate the occurrence of the event X;
by the second class, those combinations which necessarily accompany, but do
not necessarily imply, the occurrence of the event X; by the third class, those
combinations whose occurrence in connexion with the event X is impossible,
but not otherwise impossible; by the fourth class, those combinations whose
occurrence is impossible under any circumstances. I shall not dwell upon this
statement of the result of the logical analysis of the problem, further than to
remark that the elements which it presents are precisely those by which the
expectation of the event X, as dependent upon our knowledge of the events A, B,
C, is, or alone can be, affected. General reasoning would verify this conclusion;
but general reasoning would not usually avail to disentangle the complicated
web events and circumstances from which the solution above described must be
evolved. The attainment of this object constitutes the first step towards the
complete solution of the question I proposed. It is to be noted that thus far the
process of solution is logical, i. e. conducted by symbols of logical significance,
and resulting in an equation interpretable into a proposition. Let this result be
termed the final logical equation.
The second step of the process deserves attentive remark. From the final
logical equation to which the previous step has conducted us, are deduced,
by inspection, a series of algebraic equations implicitly involving the complete
solution of the problem proposed. Of the mode in which this transition is
effected let it suffice to say, that there exists a definite relation between the laws
by which the probabilities of events are expressed as algebraic functions of the
probabilities of other events upon which they depend, and the laws by which
the logical connexion of the events is itself expressed. This relation, like the
other coincidences of formal law which have been referred to, is not founded
upon hypothesis, but is made known to us by observation (I.4), and reflection.
If, however, its reality were assumed `a priori as the basis of the very definition
of Probability, strict deduction would thence lead us to the received numerical
definition as a necessary consequence. The Theory of Probabilities stands, as
it has already been remarked (I.12), in equally close relation to Logic and to
Arithmetic; and it is indifferent, so far as results are concerned, whether we
regard it as springing out of the latter of these sciences, or as founded in the
mutual relations which connect the two together.
16. There are some circumstances, interesting perhaps to the mathematician,
attending the general solutions deduced by the above method, which it may be
desirable to notice.
1st. As the method is independent of the number and the nature of the
data, it continues to be applicable when the latter are insufficient to render
determinate the value sought. When such is the case, the final expression of the
solution will contain terms with arbitrary constant coefficients. To such terms
there will correspond terms in the final logical equation (I. 15), the interpretation
of which will inform us what new data are requisite in order to determine the
values of those constants, and thus render the numerical solution complete.
If such data are not to be obtained, we can still, by giving to the constants
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 12
their limiting values 0 and 1, determine the limits within which the probability
sought must lie independently of all further experience. When the event whose
probability is sought is quite independent of those whose probabilities are given,
the limits thus obtained for its value will be 0 and 1, as it is evident that they
ought to be, and the interpretation of the constants will only lead to a restatement
of the original problem.
2ndly. The expression of the final solution will in all cases involve a particular
element of quantity, determinable by the solution of an algebraic equation. Now
when that equation is of an elevated degree, a difficulty may seem to arise as
to the selection of the proper root. There are, indeed, cases in which both the
elements given and the element sought are so obviously restricted by necessary
conditions that no choice remains. But in complex instances the discovery of
such conditions, by unassisted force of reasoning, would be hopeless. A distinct
method is requisite for this end,—a method which might not appropriately be
termed the Calculus of Statistical Conditions, into the nature of this method
I shall not here further enter than to say, that, like the previous method, it is
based upon the employment of the “final logical equation,” and that it definitely
assigns, 1st, the conditions which must be fulfilled among the numerical elements
of the data, in order that the problem may be real, i.e. derived from a possible
experience; 2ndly, the numerical limits, within which the probability sought
must have been confined, if, instead of being determined by theory, it had been
deduced directly by observation from the same system of phænomena from
which the data were derived. It is clear that these limits will be actual limits of
the probability sought. Now, on supposing the data subject to the conditions
above assigned to them, it appears in every instance which I have examined that
there exists one root, and only one root, of the final algebraic equation which is
subject to the required limitations. Every source of ambiguity is thus removed.
It would even seem that new truths relating to the theory of algebraic equations
are thus incidentally brought to light. It is remarkable that the special element
of quantity, to which the previous discussion relates, depends only upon the
data, and not at all upon the quæsitum of the problem proposed. Hence the
solution of each particular problem unties the knot of difficulty for a system of
problems, viz., for that system of problems which is marked by the possession of
common data, independently of the nature of their quæsita. This circumstance
is important whenever from a particular system of data it is required to deduce a
series of connected conclusions. And it further gives to the solutions of particular
problems that character of relationship, derived from their dependence upon a
central and fundamental unity, which not unfrequently marks the application
of general methods.
17. But though the above considerations, with others of a like nature, justify
the assertion that the method of this treatise, for the solution of questions in the
theory of Probabilities, is a general method, it does not thence follow that we are
relieved in all cases from the necessity of recourse to hypothetical grounds. It has
been observed that a solution may consist entirely of terms affected by arbitrary
constant coefficients,—may, in fact, be wholly indefinite. The application of
the method of this work to some of the most important questions within its
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 13
range would–were the data of experience alone employed–present results of this
character. To obtain a definite solution it is necessary, in such cases, to have
recourse to hypotheses possessing more or less of independent probability, but
incapable of exact verification. Generally speaking, such hypotheses will differ
from the immediate results of experience in partaking of a logical rather than
of a numerical character; in prescribing the conditions under which phænomena
occur, rather than assigning the relative frequency of their occurrence. This
circumstance is, however, unimportant. Whatever their nature may be, the
hypotheses assumed must thenceforth be regarded as belonging to the actual
data, although tending, as is obvious, to give to the solution itself somewhat of a
hypothetical character. With this understanding as to the possible sources of the
data actually employed, the method is perfectly general, but for the correctness
of the hypothetical elements introduced it is of course no more responsible than
for the correctness of the numerical data derived from experience.
In illustration of these remarks we may observe that the theory of the reduction
of astronomical observations2
rests, in part, upon hypothetical grounds.
It assumes certain positions as to the nature of error, the equal probabilities
of its occurrence in the form of excess or defect, &c., without which it would
be impossible to obtain any definite conclusions from a system of conflicting
observations. But granting such positions as the above, the residue of the investigation
falls strictly within the province of the theory of Probabilities. Similar
observations apply to the important problem which proposes to deduce from
the records of the majorities of a deliberative assembly the mean probability of
correct judgment in one of its members. If the method of this treatise be applied
to the mere numerical data, the solution obtained is of that wholly indefinite
kind above described. And to show in a more eminent degree the insufficiency
of those data by themselves, the interpretation of the arbitrary constants (I.
16) which appear in the solution, merely produces a re-statement of the original
problem. Admitting, however, the hypothesis of the independent formation
of opinion in the individual mind, either absolutely, as in the speculations of
Laplace and Poisson, or under limitations imposed by the actual data, as will
be seen in this treatise, Chap. XXI., the problem assumes a far more definite
character. It will be manifest that the ulterior value of the theory of Probabilities
must depend very much upon the correct formation of such mediate
hypotheses, where the purely experimental data are insufficient for definite solution,
and where that further experience indicated by the interpretation of the
final logical equation is unattainable. Upon the other hand, an undue readiness
to form hypotheses in subjects which from their very nature are placed beyond
human ken, must re-act upon the credit of the theory of Probabilities, and tend
to throw doubt in the general mind over its most legitimate conclusions.
18. It would, perhaps, be premature to speculate here upon the question
whether the methods of abstract science are likely at any future day to render
service in the investigation of social problems at all commensurate with those
2The author designs to treat this subject either in a separate work or in a future Appendix.
In the present treatise he avoids the use of the integral calculus.
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 14
which they have rendered in various departments of physical inquiry. An attempt
to resolve this question upon pure `a priori grounds of reasoning would be
very likely to mislead us. For example, the consideration of human free-agency
would seem at first sight to preclude the idea that the movements of the social
system should ever manifest that character of orderly evolution which we are
prepared to expect under the reign of a physical necessity. Yet already do the
researches of the statist reveal to us facts at variance with such an anticipation.
Thus the records of crime and pauperism present a degree of regularity
unknown in regions in which the disturbing influence of human wants and passions
is unfelt. On the other hand, the distemperature of seasons, the eruption
of volcanoes, the spread of blight in the vegetable, or of epidemic maladies in
the animal kingdom, things apparently or chiefly the product of natural causes,
refuse to be submitted to regular and apprehensible laws. “Fickle as the wind,”
is a proverbial expression. Reflection upon these points teaches us in some degree
to correct our earlier judgments. We learn that we are not to expect, under
the dominion of necessity, an order perceptible to human observation, unless
the play of its producing causes is sufficiently simple; nor, on the other hand,
to deem that free agency in the individual is inconsistent with regularity in the
motions of the system of which he forms a component unit. Human freedom
stands out as an apparent fact of our consciousness, while it is also, I conceive,
a highly probable deduction of analogy (Chap, XXII.) from the nature of that
portion of the mind whose scientific constitution we are able to investigate.
But whether accepted as a fact reposing on consciousness, or as a conclusion
sanctioned by the reason, it must be so interpreted as not to conflict with an
established result of observation, viz.: that phænomena, in the production of
which large masses of men are concerned, do actually exhibit a very remarkable
degree of regularity, enabling us to collect in each succeeding age the elements
upon which the estimate of its state and progress, so far as manifested in outward
results, must depend. There is thus no sound objection `a priori against
the possibility of that species of data which is requisite for the experimental
foundation of a science of social statistics. Again, whatever other object this
treatise may accomplish, it is presumed that it will leave no doubt as to the
existence of a system of abstract principles and of methods founded upon those
principles, by which any collective body of social data may be made to yield,
in an explicit form, whatever information they implicitly involve. There may,
where the data are exceedingly complex, be very great difficulty in obtaining
this information,—difficulty due not to any imperfection of the theory, but to
the laborious character of the analytical processes to which it points. It is quite
conceivable that in many instances that difficulty may be such as only united
effort could overcome. But that we possess theoretically in all cases, and practically,
so far as the requisite labour of calculation may be supplied, the means
of evolving from statistical records the seeds of general truths which lie buried
amid the mass of figures, is a position which may, I conceive, with perfect safety
be affirmed.
19. But beyond these general positions I do not venture to speak in terms of
assurance. Whether the results which might be expected from the application
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 15
of scientific methods to statistical records, over and above those the discovery of
which requires no such aid, would so far compensate for the labour involved as
to render it worth while to institute such investigations upon a proper scale of
magnitude, is a point which could, perhaps, only be determined by experience.
It is to be desired, and it might without great presumption be expected, that in
this, as in other instances, the abstract doctrines of science should minister to
more than intellectual gratification. Nor, viewing the apparent order in which
the sciences have been evolved, and have successively contributed their aid to
the service of mankind, does it seem very improbable that a day may arrive in
which similar aid may accrue from departments of the field of knowledge yet
more intimately allied with the elements of human welfare. Let the speculations
of this treatise, however, rest at present simply upon their claim to be regarded
as true.
20. I design, in the last place, to endeavour to educe from the scientific
results of the previous inquiries some general intimations respecting the nature
and constitution of the human mind. Into the grounds of the possibility of this
species of inference it is not necessary to enter here. One or two general observations
may serve to indicate the track which I shall endeavour to follow. It
cannot but be admitted that our views of the science of Logic must materially
influence, perhaps mainly determine, our opinions upon the nature of the intellectual
faculties. For example, the question whether reasoning consists merely
in the application of certain first or necessary truths, with which the mind has
been originally imprinted, or whether the mind is itself a seat of law, whose
operation is as manifest and as conclusive in the particular as in the general
formula, or whether, as some not undistinguished writers seem to maintain, all
reasoning is of particulars; this question, I say, is one which not merely affects
the science of Logic, but also concerns the formation of just views of the constitution
of the intellectual faculties. Again, if it is concluded that the mind is by
original constitution a seat of law, the question of the nature of its subjection
to this law,—whether, for instance, it is an obedience founded upon necessity,
like that which sustains the revolutions of the heavens, and preserves the order
of Nature,—or whether it is a subjection of some quite distinct kind, is also a
matter of deep speculative interest. Further, if the mind is truly determined
to be a subject of law, and if its laws also are truly assigned, the question of
their probable or necessary influence upon the course of human thought in different
ages is one invested with great importance, and well deserving a patient
investigation, as matter both of philosophy and of history. These and other
questions I propose, however imperfectly, to discuss in the concluding portion
of the present work. They belong, perhaps, to the domain of probable or conjectural,
rather than to that of positive, knowledge. But it may happen that
where there is not sufficient warrant for the certainties of science, there may
be grounds of analogy adequate for the suggestion of highly probable opinions.
It has seemed to me better that this discussion should be entirely reserved for
the sequel of the main business of this treatise,—which is the investigation of
scientific truths and laws. Experience sufficiently instructs us that the proper
order of advancement in all inquiries after truth is to proceed from the known
CHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 16
to the unknown. There are parts, even of the philosophy and constitution of the
human mind, which have been placed fully within the reach of our investigation.
To make a due acquaintance with those portions of our nature the basis of all
endeavours to penetrate amid the shadows and uncertainties of that conjectural
realm which lies beyond and above them, is the course most accordant with the
limitations of our present condition.
Chapter II
OF SIGNS IN GENERAL, AND OF THE SIGNS
APPROPRIATE TO THE SCIENCE OF LOGIC IN
PARTICULAR; ALSO OF THE LAWS TO WHICH
THAT CLASS OF SIGNS ARE SUBJECT.
1. That Language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium
for the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted. It is proposed in
this chapter to inquire what it is that renders Language thus subservient to
the most important of our intellectual faculties. In the various steps of this
inquiry we shall be led to consider the constitution of Language, considered as
a system adapted to an end or purpose; to investigate its elements; to seek to
determine their mutual relation and dependence; and to inquire in what manner
they contribute to the attainment of the end to which, as co-ordinate parts of
a system, they have respect.
In proceeding to these inquiries, it will not be necessary to enter into the
discussion of that famous question of the schools, whether Language is to be
regarded as an essential instrument of reasoning, or whether, on the other hand,
it is possible for us to reason without its aid. I suppose this question to be beside
the design of the present treatise, for the following reason, viz., that it is the
business of Science to investigate laws; and that, whether we regard signs as
the representatives of things and of their relations, or as the representatives
of the conceptions and operations of the human intellect, in studying the laws
of signs, we are in effect studying the manifested laws of reasoning. If there
exists a difference between the two inquiries, it is one which does not affect the
scientific expressions of formal law, which are the object of investigation in the
present stage of this work, but relates only to the mode in which those results
are presented to the mental regard. For though in investigating the laws of
signs, `a posteriori, the immediate subject of examination is Language, with the
rules which govern its use; while in making the internal processes of thought
the direct object of inquiry, we appeal in a more immediate way to our personal
consciousness,—it will be found that in both cases the results obtained are
formally equivalent. Nor could we easily conceive, that the unnumbered tongues
and dialects of the earth should have preserved through a long succession of ages
so much that is common and universal, were we not assured of the existence of
17
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 18
some deep foundation of their agreement in the laws of the mind itself.
2. The elements of which all language consists are signs or symbols. Words
are signs. Sometimes they are said to represent things; sometimes the operations
by which the mind combines together the simple notions of things into
complex conceptions; sometimes they express the relations of action, passion,
or mere quality, which we perceive to exist among the objects of our experience;
sometimes the emotions of the perceiving mind. But words, although in
this and in other ways they fulfil the office of signs, or representative symbols,
are not the only signs which we are capable of employing. Arbitrary marks,
which speak only to the eye, and arbitrary sounds or actions, which address
themselves to some other sense, are equally of the nature of signs, provided
that their representative office is defined and understood. In the mathematical
sciences, letters, and the symbols +, -, =, &c., are used as signs, although the
term “sign” is applied to the latter class of symbols, which represent operations
or relations, rather than to the former, which represent the elements of number
and quantity. As the real import of a sign does not in any way depend upon its
particular form or expression, so neither do the laws which determine its use.
In the present treatise, however, it is with written signs that we have to do, and
it is with reference to these exclusively that the term “sign” will be employed.
The essential properties of signs are enumerated in the following definition.
Definition.—A sign is an arbitrary mark, having a fixed interpretation, and
susceptible of combination with other signs in subjection to fixed laws dependent
upon their mutual interpretation.
3. Let us consider the particulars involved in the above definition separately.
(1.) In the first place, a sign is an arbitrary mark. It is clearly indifferent
what particular word or token we associate with a given idea, provided that
the association once made is permanent. The Romans expressed by the word
“civitas” what we designate by the word “state.” But both they and we might
equally well have employed any other word to represent the same conception.
Nothing, indeed, in the nature of Language would prevent us from using a mere
letter in the same sense. Were this done, the laws according to which that letter
would require to be used would be essentially the same with the laws which
govern the use of “civitas” in the Latin, and of “state” in the English language,
so far at least as the use of those words is regulated by any general principles
common to all languages alike.
(2.) In the second place, it is necessary that each sign should possess, within
the limits of the same discourse or process of reasoning, a fixed interpretation.
The necessity of this condition is obvious, and seems to be founded in the very
nature of the subject. There exists, however, a dispute as to the precise nature
of the representative office of words or symbols used as names in the processes of
reasoning. By some it is maintained, that they represent the conceptions of the
mind alone; by others, that they represent things. The question is not of great
importance here, as its decision cannot affect the laws according to which signs
are employed. I apprehend, however, that the general answer to this and such
like questions is, that in the processes of reasoning, signs stand in the place and
fulfil the office of the conceptions and operations of the mind; but that as those
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 19
conceptions and operations represent things, and the connexions and relations of
things, so signs represent things with their connexions and relations; and lastly,
that as signs stand in the place of the conceptions and operations of the mind,
they are subject to the laws of those conceptions and operations. This view will
be more fully elucidated in the next chapter; but it here serves to explain the
third of those particulars involved in the definition of a sign, viz., its subjection
to fixed laws of combination depending upon the nature of its interpretation.
4. The analysis and classification of those signs by which the operations of
reasoning are conducted will be considered in the following Proposition:
Proposition I.
All the operations of Language, as an instrument of reasoning, may be conducted
by a system of signs composed of the following elements, viz.:
1st. Literal symbols, as x, y, &c., representing things as subjects of our
conceptions.
2nd. Signs of operation, as +, -, ×, standing for those operations of the
mind by which the conceptions of things are combined or resolved so as to form
new conceptions involving the same elements.
3rd. The sign of identity, =.
And these symbols of Logic are in their use subject to definite laws, partly
agreeing with and partly differing from the laws of the corresponding symbols in
the science of Algebra.
Let it be assumed as a criterion of the true elements of rational discourse,
that they should be susceptible of combination in the simplest forms and by
the simplest laws, and thus combining should generate all other known and
conceivable forms of language; and adopting this principle, let the following
classification be considered.
class i.
5. Appellative or descriptive signs, expressing either the name of a thing, or
some quality or circumstance belonging to it.
To this class we may obviously refer the substantive proper or common, and
the adjective. These may indeed be regarded as differing only in this respect,
that the former expresses the substantive existence of the individual thing or
things to which it refers; the latter implies that existence. If we attach to the
adjective the universally understood subject “being” or “thing,” it becomes
virtually a substantive, and may for all the essential purposes of reasoning be
replaced by the substantive. Whether or not, in every particular of the mental
regard, it is the same thing to say, “Water is a fluid thing,” as to say, “Water is
fluid;” it is at least equivalent in the expression of the processes of reasoning.
It is clear also, that to the above class we must refer any sign which may
conventionally be used to express some circumstance or relation, the detailed
exposition of which would involve the use of many signs. The epithets of poetic
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 20
diction are very frequently of this kind. They are usually compounded adjectives,
singly fulfilling the office of a many-worded description. Homer’s “deepeddying
ocean” embodies a virtual description in the single word ßa??d????.
And conventionally any other description addressed either to the imagination
or to the intellect might equally be represented by a single sign, the use of
which would in all essential points be subject to the same laws as the use of the
adjective “good” or “great.” Combined with the subject “thing,” such a sign
would virtually become a substantive; and by a single substantive the combined
meaning both of thing and quality might be expressed.
6. Now, as it has been defined that a sign is an arbitrary mark, it is permissible
to replace all signs of the species above described by letters. Let us then
agree to represent the class of individuals to which a particular name or description
is applicable, by a single letter, as x. If the name is “men,” for instance,
let x represent “all men,” or the class “men.” By a class is usually meant a
collection of individuals, to each of which a particular name or description may
be applied; but in this work the meaning of the term will be extended so as
to include the case in which but a single individual exists, answering to the required
name or description, as well as the cases denoted by the terms “nothing”
and “universe,” which as “classes” should be understood to comprise respectively
“no beings,” “all beings.” Again, if an adjective, as “good,” is employed
as a term of description, let us represent by a letter, as y, all things to which
the description “good” is applicable, i.e. “all good things,” or the class “good
things.” Let it further be agreed, that by the combination xy shall be represented
that class of things to which the names or descriptions represented by x
and y are simultaneously applicable. Thus, if x alone stands for “white things,”
and y for “sheep,” let xy stand for “white sheep;” and in like manner, if z stand
for “horned things,” and x and y retain their previous interpretations, let zxy
represent “horned white sheep,” i.e. that collection of things to which the name
“sheep,” and the descriptions “white” and “horned” are together applicable.
Let us now consider the laws to which the symbols x, y, &c., used in the
above sense, are subject.
7. First, it is evident, that according to the above combinations, the order in
which two symbols are written is indifferent. The expressions xy and yx equally
represent that class of things to the several members of which the names or
descriptions x and y are together applicable. Hence we have,
xy = yx. (1)
In the case of x representing white things, and y sheep, either of the members
of this equation will represent the class of “white sheep.” There may be a
difference as to the order in which the conception is formed, but there is none
as to the individual things which are comprehended under it. In like manner,
if x represent “estuaries,” and y “rivers,” the expressions xy and yx will indifferently
represent “rivers that are estuaries,” or “estuaries that are rivers,” the
combination in this case being in ordinary language that of two substantives,
instead of that of a substantive and an adjective as in the previous instance.
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 21
Let there be a third symbol, as z, representing that class of things to which the
term “navigable” is applicable, and any one of the following expressions,
zxy, zyx, xyz, &c.,
will represent the class of “navigable rivers that are estuaries.”
If one of the descriptive terms should have some implied reference to another,
it is only necessary to include that reference expressly in its stated meaning, in
order to render the above remarks still applicable. Thus, if x represent “wise”
and y “counsellor,” we shall have to define whether x implies wisdom in the
absolute sense, or only the wisdom of counsel. With such definition the law
xy = yx continues to be valid.
We are permitted, therefore, to employ the symbols x, y, z, &c., in the place
of the substantives, adjectives, and descriptive phrases subject to the rule of interpretation,
that any expression in which several of these symbols are written
together shall represent all the objects or individuals to which their several meanings
are together applicable, and to the law that the order in which the symbols
succeed each other is indifferent.
As the rule of interpretation has been sufficiently exemplified, I shall deem it
unnecessary always to express the subject “things” in defining the interpretation
of a symbol used for an adjective. When I say, let x represent “good,” it will
be understood that x only represents “good” when a subject for that quality
is supplied by another symbol, and that, used alone, its interpretation will be
“good things.”
8. Concerning the law above determined, the following observations, which
will also be more or less appropriate to certain other laws to be deduced hereafter,
may be added.
First, I would remark, that this law is a law of thought, and not, properly
speaking, a law of things. Difference in the order of the qualities or attributes
of an object, apart from all questions of causation, is a difference in conception
merely. The law (1) expresses as a general truth, that the same thing may be
conceived in different ways, and states the nature of that difference; and it does
no more than this.
Secondly, As a law of thought, it is actually developed in a law of Language,
the product and the instrument of thought. Though the tendency of prose
writing is toward uniformity, yet even there the order of sequence of adjectives
absolute in their meaning, and applied to the same subject, is indifferent, but
poetic diction borrows much of its rich diversity from the extension of the same
lawful freedom to the substantive also. The language of Milton is peculiarly
distinguished by this species of variety. Not only does the substantive often
precede the adjectives by which it is qualified, but it is frequently placed in
their midst. In the first few lines of the invocation to Light, we meet with such
examples as the following:
“Offspring of heaven first-born.”
“The rising world of waters dark and deep.”
“Bright effluence of bright essence increate.”
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 22
Now these inverted forms are not simply the fruits of a poetic license. They
are the natural expressions of a freedom sanctioned by the intimate laws of
thought, but for reasons of convenience not exercised in the ordinary use of
language.
Thirdly, The law expressed by (1) may be characterized by saying that the
literal symbols x, y, z, are commutative, like the symbols of Algebra. In saying
this, it is not affirmed that the process of multiplication in Algebra, of which
the fundamental law is expressed by the equation
xy = yx,
possesses in itself any analogy with that process of logical combination which
xy has been made to represent above; but only that if the arithmetical and the
logical process are expressed in the same manner, their symbolical expressions
will be subject to the same formal law. The evidence of that subjection is in
the two cases quite distinct.
9. As the combination of two literal symbols in the form xy expresses the
whole of that class of objects to which the names or qualities represented by x
and y are together applicable, it follows that if the two symbols have exactly
the same signification, their combination expresses no more than either of the
symbols taken alone would do. In such case we should therefore have
xy = x.
As y is, however, supposed to have the same meaning as x, we may replace it
in the above equation by x, and we thus get
xx = x.
Now in common Algebra the combination xx is more briefly represented by x
2
.
Let us adopt the same principle of notation here; for the mode of expressing a
particular succession of mental operations is a thing in itself quite as arbitrary
as the mode of expressing a single idea or operation (II. 3). In accordance with
this notation, then, the above equation assumes the form
x
2 = x, (2)
and is, in fact, the expression of a second general law of those symbols by which
names, qualities, or descriptions, are symbolically represented.
The reader must bear in mind that although the symbols x and y in the examples
previously formed received significations distinct from each other, nothing
prevents us from attributing to them precisely the same signification. It is
evident that the more nearly their actual significations approach to each other,
the more nearly does the class of things denoted by the combination xy approach
to identity with the class denoted by x, as well as with that denoted
by y. The case supposed in the demonstration of the equation (2) is that of
absolute identity of meaning. The law which it expresses is practically exemplified
in language. To say “good, good,” in relation to any subject, though
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 23
a cumbrous and useless pleonasm, is the same as to say “good.” Thus “good,
good” men, is equivalent to “good” men. Such repetitions of words are indeed
sometimes employed to heighten a quality or strengthen an affirmation. But this
effect is merely secondary and conventional; it is not founded in the intrinsic
relations of language and thought. Most of the operations which we observe in
nature, or perform ourselves, are of such a kind that their effect is augmented
by repetition, and this circumstance prepares us to expect the same thing in
language, and even to use repetition when we design to speak with emphasis.
But neither in strict reasoning nor in exact discourse is there any just ground
for such a practice.
10. We pass now to the consideration of another class of the signs of speech,
and of the laws connected with their use.
class ii.
11. Signs of those mental operations whereby we collect parts into a whole,
or separate a whole into its parts.
We are not only capable of entertaining the conceptions of objects, as characterized
by names, qualities, or circumstances, applicable to each individual of
the group under consideration, but also of forming the aggregate conception of a
group of objects consisting of partial groups, each of which is separately named
or described. For this purpose we use the conjunctions “and,” “or,” &c. “Trees
and minerals,” “barren mountains, or fertile vales,” are examples of this kind.
In strictness, the words “and,” “or,” interposed between the terms descriptive
of two or more classes of objects, imply that those classes are quite distinct, so
that no member of one is found in another. In this and in all other respects
the words “and” “or” are analogous with the sign + in algebra, and their laws
are identical. Thus the expression “men and women” is, conventional meanings
set aside, equivalent with the expression “women and men.” Let x represent
“men,” y, “women;” and let + stand for “and” and “or,” then we have
x + y = y + x, (3)
an equation which would equally hold true if x and y represented numbers, and
+ were the sign of arithmetical addition.
Let the symbol z stand for the adjective “European,” then since it is, in
effect, the same thing to say “European men and women,” as to say “European
men and European women,” we have
z (x + y) = zx + zy. (4)
And this equation also would be equally true were x, y, and z symbols of number,
and were the juxtaposition of two literal symbols to represent their algebraic
product, just as in the logical signification previously given, it represents the
class of objects to which both the epithets conjoined belong.
The above are the laws which govern the use of the sign +, here used to
denote the positive operation of aggregating parts into a whole. But the very
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 24
idea of an operation effecting some positive change seems to suggest to us the
idea of an opposite or negative operation, having the effect of undoing what
the former one has done. Thus we cannot conceive it possible to collect parts
into a whole, and not conceive it also possible to separate a part from a whole.
This operation we express in common language by the sign except, as, “All men
except Asiatics,” “All states except those which are monarchical.” Here it is
implied that the things excepted form a part of the things from which they are
excepted. As we have expressed the operation of aggregation by the sign +, so
we may express the negative operation above described by - minus. Thus if x be
taken to represent men, and y, Asiatics, i. e. Asiatic men, then the conception
of “All men except Asiatics” will be expressed by x - y. And if we represent
by x, “states,” and by y the descriptive property “having a monarchical form,”
then the conception of “All states except those which are monarchical” will be
expressed by x - xy.
As it is indifferent for all the essential purposes of reasoning whether we
express excepted cases first or last in the order of speech, it is also indifferent in
what order we write any series of terms, some of which are affected by the sign
-. Thus we have, as in the common algebra,
x - y = -y + x. (5)
Still representing by x the class “men,” and by y “Asiatics,” let z represent the
adjective “white.” Now to apply the adjective “white” to the collection of men
expressed by the phrase “Men except Asiatics,” is the same as to say, “White
men, except white Asiatics.” Hence we have
z (x - y) = zx - zy. (6)
This is also in accordance with the laws of ordinary algebra.
The equations (4) and (6) may be considered as exemplification of a single
general law, which may be stated by saying, that the literal symbols, x, y, z, &c.
are distributive in their operation. The general fact which that law expresses is
this, viz.:—If any quality or circumstance is ascribed to all the members of a
group, formed either by aggregation or exclusion of partial groups, the resulting
conception is the same as if the quality or circumstance were first ascribed to
each member of the partial groups, and the aggregation or exclusion effected
afterwards. That which is ascribed to the members of the whole is ascribed to
the members of all its parts, howsoever those parts are connected together.
class iii.
12. Signs by which relation is expressed, and by which we form propositions.
Though all verbs may with propriety be referred to this class, it is sufficient
for the purposes of Logic to consider it as including only the substantive verb
is or are, since every other verb may be resolved into this element, and one of
the signs included under Class I. For as those signs are used to express quality
or circumstance of every kind, they may be employed to express the active or
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 25
passive relation of the subject of the verb, considered with reference either to
past, to present, or to future time. Thus the Proposition, “Cæsar conquered
the Gauls,” may be resolved into “Cæsar is he who conquered the Gauls.” The
ground of this analysis I conceive to be the following:—Unless we understand
what is meant by having conquered the Gauls, i.e. by the expression “One
who conquered the Gauls,” we cannot understand the sentence in question. It
is, therefore, truly an element of that sentence; another element is “Cæsar,”
and there is yet another required, the copula is to show the connexion of these
two. I do not, however, affirm that there is no other mode than the above of
contemplating the relation expressed by the proposition, “Cæsar conquered the
Gauls;” but only that the analysis here given is a correct one for the particular
point of view which has been taken, and that it suffices for the purposes of
logical deduction. It may be remarked that the passive and future participles of
the Greek language imply the existence of the principle which has been asserted,
viz.: that the sign is or are may be regarded as an element of every personal
verb.
13. The above sign, is or are may be expressed by the symbol =. The laws,
or as would usually be said, the axioms which the symbol introduces, are next
to be considered.
Let us take the Proposition, “The stars are the suns and the planets,” and
let us represent stars by x, suns by y, and planets by z; we have then
x = y + z. (7)
Now if it be true that the stars are the suns and the planets, it will follow that
the stars, except the planets, are suns. This would give the equation
x - z = y, (8)
which must therefore be a deduction from (7). Thus a term z has been removed
from one side of an equation to the other by changing its sign. This is in
accordance with the algebraic rule of transposition.
But instead of dwelling upon particular cases, we may at once affirm the
general axioms:—
1st. If equal things are added to equal things, the wholes are equal.
2nd. If equal things are taken from equal things, the remainders are equal.
And it hence appears that we may add or subtract equations, and employ
the rule of transposition above given just as in common algebra.
Again: If two classes of things, x and y, be identical, that is, if all the
members of the one are members of the other, then those members of the one
class which possess a given property z will be identical with those members of
the other which possess the same property z. Hence if we have the equation
x = y;
then whatever class or property z may represent, we have also
zx = zy.
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 26
This is formally the same as the algebraic law:—If both members of an equation
are multiplied by the same quantity, the products are equal.
In like manner it may be shown that if the corresponding members of two
equations are multiplied together, the resulting equation is true.
14. Here, however, the analogy of the present system with that of algebra,
as commonly stated, appears to stop. Suppose it true that those members of a
class x which possess a certain property z are identical with those members of a
class y which possess the same property z, it does not follow that the members
of the class x universally are identical with the members of the class y. Hence
it cannot be inferred from the equation
zx = zy,
that the equation
x = y
is also true. In other words, the axiom of algebraists, that both sides of an
equation may be divided by the same quantity, has no formal equivalent here.
I say no formal equivalent, because, in accordance with the general spirit of
these inquiries, it is not even sought to determine whether the mental operation
which is represented by removing a logical symbol, z, from a combination zx,
is in itself analogous with the operation of division in Arithmetic. That mental
operation is indeed identical with what is commonly termed Abstraction, and it
will hereafter appear that its laws are dependent upon the laws already deduced
in this chapter. What has now been shown is, that there does not exist among
those laws anything analogous in form with a commonly received axiom of
Algebra.
But a little consideration will show that even in common algebra that axiom
does not possess the generality of those other axioms which have been considered.
The deduction of the equation x = y from the equation zx = zy is only
valid when it is known that z is not equal to 0. If then the value z = 0 is supposed
to be admissible in the algebraic system, the axiom above stated ceases
to be applicable, and the analogy before exemplified remains at least unbroken.
15. However, it is not with the symbols of quantity generally that it is of
any importance, except as a matter of speculation, to trace such affinities. We
have seen (II. 9) that the symbols of Logic are subject to the special law,
x
2 = x.
Now of the symbols of Number there are but two, viz. 0 and 1, which are
subject to the same formal law. We know that 02 = 0, and that 12 = 1; and
the equation x
2 = x, considered as algebraic, has no other roots than 0 and 1.
Hence, instead of determining the measure of formal agreement of the symbols
of Logic with those of Number generally, it is more immediately suggested to
us to compare them with symbols of quantity admitting only of the values 0
and 1. Let us conceive, then, of an Algebra in which the symbols x, y, z, etc.
admit indifferently of the values 0 and 1, and of these values alone. The laws,
CHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 27
the axioms, and the processes, of such an Algebra will be identical in their
whole extent with the laws, the axioms, and the processes of an Algebra of
Logic. Difference of interpretation will alone divide them. Upon this principle
the method of the following work is established.
16. It now remains to show that those constituent parts of ordinary language
which have not been considered in the previous sections of this chapter are either
resolvable into the same elements as those which have been considered, or are
subsidiary to those elements by contributing to their more precise definition.
The substantive, the adjective, and the verb, together with the particles
and, except, we have already considered. The pronoun may be regarded as a
particular form of the substantive or the adjective. The adverb modifies the
meaning of the verb, but does not affect its nature. Prepositions contribute
to the expression of circumstance or relation, and thus tend to give precision
and detail to the meaning of the literal symbols. The conjunctions if, either,
or, are used chiefly in the expression of relation among propositions, and it
will hereafter be shown that the same relations can be completely expressed by
elementary symbols analogous in interpretation, and identical in form and law
with the symbols whose use and meaning have been explained in this Chapter.
As to any remaining elements of speech, it will, upon examination, be found that
they are used either to give a more definite significance to the terms of discourse,
and thus enter into the interpretation of the literal symbols already considered,
or to express some emotion or state of feeling accompanying the utterance of a
proposition, and thus do not belong to the province of the understanding, with
which alone our present concern lies. Experience of its use will testify to the
sufficiency of the classification which has been adopted.
Chapter III
DERIVATION OF THE LAWS OF THE SYMBOLS OF
LOGIC FROM THE LAWS OF THE OPERATIONS OF
THE HUMAN MIND.
1. The object of science, properly so called, is the knowledge of laws and relations.
To be able to distinguish what is essential to this end, from what is
only accidentally associated with it, is one of the most important conditions
of scientific progress. I say, to distinguish between these elements, because a
consistent devotion to science does not require that the attention should be
altogether withdrawn from other speculations, often of a metaphysical nature,
with which it is not unfrequently connected. Such questions, for instance, as
the existence of a sustaining ground of phænomena, the reality of cause, the
propriety of forms of speech implying that the successive states of things are
connected by operations, and others of a like nature, may possess a deep interest
and significance in relation to science, without being essentially scientific. It is
indeed scarcely possible to express the conclusions of natural science without
borrowing the language of these conceptions. Nor is there necessarily any practical
inconvenience arising from this source. They who believe, and they who
refuse to believe, that there is more in the relation of cause and effect than an
invariable order of succession, agree in their interpretation of the conclusions
of physical astronomy. But they only agree because they recognise a common
element of scientific truth, which is independent of their particular views of the
nature of causation.
2. If this distinction is important in physical science, much more does it
deserve attention in connexion with the science of the intellectual powers. For
the questions which this science presents become, in expression at least, almost
necessarily mixed up with modes of thought and language, which betray a metaphysical
origin. The idealist would give to the laws of reasoning one form of
expression; the sceptic, if true to his principles, another. They who regard the
phænomena with which we are concerned in this inquiry as the mere successive
states of the thinking subject devoid of any causal connexion, and they
who refer them to the operations of an active intelligence, would, if consistent,
equally differ in their modes of statement. Like difference would also result
from a difference of classification of the mental faculties. Now the principle
28
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 29
which I would here assert, as affording us the only ground of confidence and
stability amid so much of seeming and of real diversity, is the following, viz.,
that if the laws in question are really deduced from observation, they have a
real existence as laws of the human mind, independently of any metaphysical
theory which may seem to be involved in the mode of their statement. They
contain an element of truth which no ulterior criticism upon the nature, or even
upon the reality, of the mind’s operations, can essentially affect. Let it even
be granted that the mind is but a succession of states of consciousness, a series
of fleeting impressions uncaused from without or from within, emerging out of
nothing, and returning into nothing again,—the last refinement of the sceptic
intellect,—still, as laws of succession, or at least of a past succession, the results
to which observation had led would remain true. They would require to be
interpreted into a language from whose vocabulary all such terms as cause and
effect, operation and subject, substance and attribute, had been banished; but
they would still be valid as scientific truths.
Moreover, as any statement of the laws of thought, founded upon actual
observation, must thus contain scientific elements which are independent of
metaphysical theories of the nature of the mind, the practical application of
such elements to the construction of a system or method of reasoning must
also be independent of metaphysical distinctions. For it is upon the scientific
elements involved in the statement of the laws, that any practical application
will rest, just as the practical conclusions of physical astronomy are independent
of any theory of the cause of gravitation, but rest only on the knowledge of
its phænomenal effects. And, therefore, as respects both the determination of
the laws of thought, and the practical use of them when discovered, we are,
for all really scientific ends, unconcerned with the truth or falsehood of any
metaphysical speculations whatever.
3. The course which it appears to me to be expedient, under these circumstances,
to adopt, is to avail myself as far as possible of the language of common
discourse, without regard to any theory of the nature and powers of the mind
which it may be thought to embody. For instance, it is agreeable to common
usage to say that we converse with each other by the communication of ideas,
or conceptions, such communication being the office of words; and that with
reference to any particular ideas or conceptions presented to it, the mind possesses
certain powers or faculties by which the mental regard maybe fixed upon
some ideas, to the exclusion of others, or by which the given conceptions or
ideas may, in various ways, be combined together. To those faculties or powers
different names, as Attention, Simple Apprehension, Conception or Imagination,
Abstraction, &c., have been given,—names which have not only furnished
the titles of distinct divisions of the philosophy of the human mind, but passed
into the common language of men. Whenever, then, occasion shall occur to use
these terms, I shall do so without implying thereby that I accept the theory
that the mind possesses such and such powers and faculties as distinct elements
of its activity. Nor is it indeed necessary to inquire whether such powers of the
understanding have a distinct existence or not. We may merge these different
titles under the one generic name of Operations of the human mind, define these
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 30
operations so far as is necessary for the purposes of this work, and then seek to
express their ultimate laws. Such will be the general order of the course which
I shall pursue, though reference will occasionally be made to the names which
common agreement has assigned to the particular states or operations of the
mind which may fall under our notice.
It will be most convenient to distribute the more definite results of the
following investigation into distinct Propositions.
Proposition I.
4. To deduce the laws of the symbols of Logic from a consideration of those
operations of the mind which are implied in the strict use of language as an
instrument of reasoning.
In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts,
or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed
limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most
unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the
widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive
with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less
spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing
the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions
that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men
under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of
the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may
properly be termed the universe of discourse.
5. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate
subject of the discourse. The office of any name or descriptive term
employed under the limitations supposed is not to raise in the mind the conception
of all the beings or objects to which that name or description is applicable,
but only of those which exist within the supposed universe of discourse. If that
universe of discourse is the actual universe of things, which it always is when
our words are taken in their real and literal sense, then by men we mean all
men that exist; but if the universe of discourse is limited by any antecedent
implied understanding, then it is of men under the limitation thus introduced
that we speak. It is in both cases the business of the word men to direct a
certain operation of the mind, by which, from the proper universe of discourse,
we select or fix upon the individuals signified.
6. Exactly of the same kind is the mental operation implied by the use of
an adjective. Let, for instance, the universe of discourse be the actual Universe.
Then, as the word men directs us to select mentally from that Universe all the
beings to which the term “men” is applicable; so the adjective “good,” in the
combination “good men,” directs us still further to select mentally from the
class of men all those who possess the further quality “good;” and if another
adjective were prefixed to the combination “good men,” it would direct a further
operation of the same nature, having reference to that further quality which it
might be chosen to express.
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 31
It is important to notice carefully the real nature of the operation here
described, for it is conceivable, that it might have been different from what it is.
Were the adjective simply attributive in its character, it would seem, that when a
particular set of beings is designated by men, the prefixing of the adjective good
would direct us to attach mentally to all those beings the quality of goodness.
But this is not the real office of the adjective. The operation which we really
perform is one of selection according to a prescribed principle or idea. To what
faculties of the mind such an operation would be referred, according to the
received classification of its powers, it is not important to inquire, but I suppose
that it would be considered as dependent upon the two faculties of Conception
or Imagination, and Attention. To the one of these faculties might be referred
the formation of the general conception; to the other the fixing of the mental
regard upon those individuals within the prescribed universe of discourse which
answer to the conception. If, however, as seems not improbable, the power
of Attention is nothing more than the power of continuing the exercise of any
other faculty of the mind, we might properly regard the whole of the mental
process above described as referrible to the mental faculty of Imagination or
Conception, the first step of the process being the conception of the Universe
itself, and each succeeding step limiting in a definite manner the conception
thus formed. Adopting this view, I shall describe each such step, or any definite
combination of such steps, as a definite act of conception. And the use of this
term I shall extend so as to include in its meaning not only the conception of
classes of objects represented by particular names or simple attributes of quality,
but also the combination of such conceptions in any manner consistent with the
powers and limitations of the human mind; indeed, any intellectual operation
short of that which is involved in the structure of a sentence or proposition.
The general laws to which such operations of the mind are subject are now to
be considered.
7. Now it will be shown that the laws which in the preceding chapter have
been determined `a posteriori from the constitution of language, for the use
of the literal symbols of Logic, are in reality the laws of that definite mental
operation which has just been described. We commence our discourse with a
certain understanding as to the limits of its subject, i.e. as to the limits of its
Universe. Every name, every term of description that we employ, directs him
whom we address to the performance of a certain mental operation upon that
subject. And thus is thought communicated. But as each name or descriptive
term is in this view but the representative of an intellectual operation, that
operation being also prior in the order of nature, it is clear that the laws of the
name or symbol must be of a derivative character,—must, in fact, originate in
those of the operation which they represent. That the laws of the symbol and
of the mental process are identical in expression will now be shown.
8. Let us then suppose that the universe of our discourse is the actual
universe, so that words are to be used in the full extent of their meaning, and
let us consider the two mental operations implied by the words “white” and
“men.” The word “men” implies the operation of selecting in thought from its
subject, the universe, all men; and the resulting conception, men, becomes the
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 32
subject of the next operation. The operation implied by the word “white” is that
of selecting from its subject, “men,” all of that class which are white. The final
resulting conception is that of “white men.” Now it is perfectly apparent that
if the operations above described had been performed in a converse order, the
result would have been the same. Whether we begin by forming the conception
of “men,” and then by a second intellectual act limit that conception to “white
men,” or whether we begin by forming the conception of “white objects,” and
then limit it to such of that class as are “men,” is perfectly indifferent so far
as the result is concerned. It is obvious that the order of the mental processes
would be equally indifferent if for the words “white” and “men” we substituted
any other descriptive or appellative terms whatever, provided only that their
meaning was fixed and absolute. And thus the indifference of the order of two
successive acts of the faculty of Conception, the one of which furnishes the
subject upon which the other is supposed to operate, is a general condition of
the exercise of that faculty. It is a law of the mind, and it is the real origin of
that law of the literal symbols of Logic which constitutes its formal expression
(1) Chap. II.
9. It is equally clear that the mental operation above described is of such
a nature that its effect is not altered by repetition. Suppose that by a definite
act of conception the attention has been fixed upon men, and that by another
exercise of the same faculty we limit it to those of the race who are white. Then
any further repetition of the latter mental act, by which the attention is limited
to white objects, does not in any way modify the conception arrived at, viz.,
that of white men. This is also an example of a general law of the mind, and it
has its formal expression in the law ((2) Chap, II.) of the literal symbols.
10. Again, it is manifest that from the conceptions of two distinct classes
of things we can form the conception of that collection of things which the two
classes taken together compose; and it is obviously indifferent in what order of
position or of priority those classes are presented to the mental view. This is
another general law of the mind, and its expression is found in (3) Chap. II.
11. It is not necessary to pursue this course of inquiry and comparison. Sufficient
illustration has been given to render manifest the two following positions,
viz.:
First, That the operations of the mind, by which, in the exercise of its
power of imagination or conception, it combines and modifies the simple ideas
of things or qualities, not less than those operations of the reason which are
exercised upon truths and propositions, are subject to general laws.
Secondly, That those laws are mathematical in their form, and that they are
actually developed in the essential laws of human language. Wherefore the laws
of the symbols of Logic are deducible from a consideration of the operations of
the mind in reasoning.
12. The remainder of this chapter will be occupied with questions relating
to that law of thought whose expression is x
2 = x (II. 9), a law which, as has
been implied (II. 15), forms the characteristic distinction of the operations of the
mind in its ordinary discourse and reasoning, as compared with its operations
when occupied with the general algebra of quantity. An important part of the
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 33
following inquiry will consist in proving that the symbols 0 and 1 occupy a place,
and are susceptible of an interpretation, among the symbols of Logic; and it may
first be necessary to show how particular symbols, such as the above, may with
propriety and advantage be employed in the representation of distinct systems
of thought.
The ground of this propriety cannot consist in any community of interpretation.
For in systems of thought so truly distinct as those of Logic and Arithmetic
(I use the latter term in its widest sense as the science of Number), there is,
properly speaking, no community of subject. The one of them is conversant with
the very conceptions of things, the other takes account solely of their numerical
relations. But inasmuch as the forms and methods of any system of reasoning
depend immediately upon the laws to which the symbols are subject, and only
mediately, through the above link of connexion, upon their interpretation, there
may be both propriety and advantage in employing the same symbols in different
systems of thought, provided that such interpretations can be assigned to
them as shall render their formal laws identical, and their use consistent. The
ground of that employment will not then be community of interpretation, but
the community of the formal laws, to which in their respective systems they
are subject. Nor must that community of formal laws be established upon any
other ground than that of a careful observation and comparison of those results
which are seen to flow independently from the interpretations of the systems
under consideration.
These observations will explain the process of inquiry adopted in the following
Proposition. The literal symbols of Logic are universally subject to the law
whose expression is x
2 = x. Of the symbols of Number there are two only, 0
and 1, which satisfy this law. But each of these symbols is also subject to a
law peculiar to itself in the system of numerical magnitude, and this suggests
the inquiry, what interpretations must be given to the literal symbols of Logic,
in order that the same peculiar and formal laws may be realized in the logical
system also.
Proposition II
13. To determine the logical value and significance of the symbols 0 and 1.
The symbol 0, as used in Algebra, satisfies the following formal law,
0 × y = 0, or 0y = 0, (1)
whatever number y may represent. That this formal law may be obeyed in
the system of Logic, we must assign to the symbol 0 such an interpretation
that the class represented by 0y may be identical with the class represented
by 0, whatever the class y may be. A little consideration will show that this
condition is satisfied if the symbol 0 represent Nothing. In accordance with a
previous definition, we may term Nothing a class. In fact, Nothing and Universe
are the two limits of class extension, for they are the limits of the possible
interpretations of general names, none of which can relate to fewer individuals
than are comprised in Nothing, or to more than are comprised in the Universe.
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 34
Now whatever the class y may be, the individuals which are common to it and to
the class “Nothing” are identical with those comprised in the class “Nothing,”
for they are none. And thus by assigning to 0 the interpretation Nothing, the law
(1) is satisfied; and it is not otherwise satisfied consistently with the perfectly
general character of the class y.
Secondly, The symbol 1 satisfies in the system of Number the following law,
viz.,
1 × y = y, or 1y = y,
whatever number y may represent. And this formal equation being assumed as
equally valid in the system of this work, in which 1 and y represent classes, it
appears that the symbol 1 must represent such a class that all the individuals
which are found in any proposed class y are also all the individuals 1y that are
common to that class y and the class represented by 1. A little consideration
will here show that the class represented by 1 must be “the Universe,” since this
is the only class in which are found all the individuals that exist in any class.
Hence the respective interpretations of the symbols 0 and 1 in the system of
Logic are Nothing and Universe.
14. As with the idea of any class of objects as “men,” there is suggested
to the mind the idea of the contrary class of beings which are not men; and
as the whole Universe is made up of these two classes together, since of every
individual which it comprehends we may affirm either that it is a man, or that
it is not a man, it becomes important to inquire how such contrary names are
to be expressed. Such is the object of the following Proposition.
Proposition III.
If x represent any class of objects, then will 1 - x represent the contrary or
supplementary class of objects., i.e. the class including all objects which are not
comprehended in the class x.
For greater distinctness of conception let x represent the class men, and let
us express, according to the last Proposition, the Universe by 1; now if from the
conception of the Universe, as consisting of “men” and “not-men,” we exclude
the conception of “men,” the resulting conception is that of the contrary class,
“not-men.” Hence the class “not-men” will be represented by 1 - x. And, in
general, whatever class of objects is represented by the symbol x, the contrary
class will be expressed by 1 - x.
15. Although the following Proposition belongs in strictness to a future
chapter of this work, devoted to the subject of maxims or necessary truths, yet,
on account of the great importance of that law of thought to which it relates,
it has been thought proper to introduce it here.
Proposition IV.
That axiom of metaphysicians which is termed the principle of contradiction,
and which affirms that it is impossible for any being to possess a quality, and
at the same time not to possess it, is a consequence of the fundamental law of
thought, whose expression is x
2 = x.
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 35
Let us write this equation in the form
x - x
2 = 0,
whence we have
x (1 - x) = 0; (1)
both these transformations being justified by the axiomatic laws of combination
and transposition (II. 13). Let us, for simplicity of conception, give to the
symbol x the particular interpretation of men, then 1 - x will represent the
class: of “not-men” (Prop. III.) Now the formal product of the expressions of
two classes represents that class of individuals which is common to them both
(II. 6). Hence x (1 - x) will represent the class whose members are at once
“men,” and “not men,” and the equation (1) thus express the principle, that
a class whose members are at the same time men and not men does not exist.
In other words, that it is impossible for the same individual to be at the same
time a man and not a man. Now let the meaning of the symbol x be extended
from the representing of “men,” to that of any class of beings characterized by
the possession of any quality whatever; and the equation (1) will then express
that it is impossible for a being to possess a quality and not to possess that
quality at the same time. But this is identically that “principle of contradiction”
which Aristotle has described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy. “It
is impossible that the same quality should both belong and not belong to the
same thing.. . . This is the most certain of all principles.. . .Wherefore they who
demonstrate refer to this as an ultimate opinion. For it is by nature the source
of all the other axioms.”1
The above interpretation has been introduced not on account of its immediate
value in the present system, but as an illustration of a significant fact in
the philosophy of the intellectual powers, viz., that what has been commonly
regarded as the fundamental axiom of metaphysics is but the consequence of a
law of thought, mathematical in its form. I desire to direct attention also to the
circumstance that the equation (1) in which that fundamental law of thought
is expressed is an equation of the second degree.2 Without speculating at all

2Should it here be said that the existence of the equation x
2 = x necessitates also the
existence of the equation x
3 = x, which is of the third degree, and then inquired whether that
equation does not indicate a process of trichotomy; the answer is, that the equation x
3 = x
is not interpretable in the system of logic. For writing it in either of the forms
x (1 - x) (1 + x) = 0, (2)
x (1 - x) (-1 - x) = 0, (3)
we see that its interpretation, if possible at all, must involve that of the factor 1 + x, or of the
factor -1 - x. The former is not interpretable, because we cannot conceive of the addition
of any class x to the universe 1; the latter is not interpretable, because the symbol -1 is not
subject to the law x(1 - x) = 0, to which all class symbols are subject. Hence the equation
x
3 = x admits of no interpretation analogous to that of the equation x
2 = x. Were the former
equation, however, true independently of the latter, i.e. were that act of the mind which is
CHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 36
in this chapter upon the question, whether that circumstance is necessary in
its own nature, we may venture to assert that if it had not existed, the whole
procedure of the understanding would have been different from what it is. Thus
it is a consequence of the fact that the fundamental equation of thought is of
the second degree, that we perform the operation of analysis and classification,
by division into pairs of opposites, or, as it is technically said, by dichotomy.
Now if the equation in question had been of the third degree, still admitting
of interpretation as such, the mental division must have been threefold in character,
and we must have proceeded by a species of trichotomy, the real nature
of which it is impossible for us, with our existing faculties, adequately to conceive,
but the laws of which we might still investigate as an object of intellectual
speculation.
16. The law of thought expressed by the equation (1) will, for reasons which
are made apparent by the above discussion, be occasionally referred to as the
“law of duality.”
denoted by the symbol x, such that its second repetition should reproduce the result of a
single operation, but not its first or mere repetition, it is presumable that we should be able
to interpret one of the forms (1), (2), which under the actual conditions of thought we cannot
do. There exist operations, known to the mathematician, the law of which may be adequately
expressed by the equation x
3 = x. But they are of a nature altogether foreign to the province
of general reasoning.
In saying that it is conceivable that the law of thought might have been different from what
it is, I mean only that we can frame such an hypothesis, and study its consequences. The
possibility of doing this involves no such doctrine as that the actual law of human reason is
the product either of chance or of arbitrary will.
Chapter IV
OF THE DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS INTO THE
TWO CLASSES OF “PRIMARY” AND
“SECONDARY;” OF THE CHARACTERISTIC
PROPERTIES OF THOSE CLASSES, AND OF THE
LAWS OF THE EXPRESSION OF PRIMARY
PROPOSITIONS.
1. The laws of those mental operations which are concerned in the processes of
Conception or Imagination having been investigated, and the corresponding laws
of the symbols by which they are represented explained, we are led to consider
the practical application of the results obtained: first, in the expression of the
complex terms of propositions; secondly, in the expression of propositions; and
lastly, in the construction of a general method of deductive analysis. In the
present chapter we shall be chiefly concerned with the first of these objects, as
an introduction to which it is necessary to establish the following Proposition:
Proposition I.
All logical propositions may be considered as belonging to one or the other
of two great classes, to which the respective names of “Primary” or “Concrete
Propositions,” and “Secondary” or “Abstract Propositions,” may be given.
Every assertion that we make may be referred to one or the other of the two
following kinds. Either it expresses a relation among things, or it expresses, or
is equivalent to the expression of, a relation among propositions. An assertion
respecting the properties of things, or the phænomena which they manifest, or
the circumstances in which they are placed, is, properly speaking, the assertion
of a relation among things. To say that “snow is white,” is for the ends of
logic equivalent to saying, that “snow is a white thing.” An assertion respecting
facts or events, their mutual connexion and dependence, is, for the same ends,
generally equivalent to the assertion, that such and such propositions concerning
those events have a certain relation to each other as respects their mutual
truth or falsehood. The former class of propositions, relating to things, I call
“Primary;” the latter class, relating to propositions, I call “Secondary.” The
37
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 38
distinction is in practice nearly but not quite co-extensive with the common
logical distinction of propositions as categorical or hypothetical.
For instance, the propositions, “The sun shines,” “The earth is warmed,” are
primary; the proposition, “If the sun shines the earth is warmed,” is secondary.
To say, “The sun shines,” is to say, “The sun is that which shines,” and it
expresses a relation between two classes of things, viz., “the sun” and “things
which shine.” The secondary proposition, however, given above, expresses a
relation of dependence between the two primary propositions, “The sun shines,”
and “The earth is warmed.” I do not hereby affirm that the relation between
these propositions is, like that which exists between the facts which they express,
a relation of causality, but only that the relation among the propositions so
implies, and is so implied by, the relation among the facts, that it may for the
ends of logic be used as a fit representative of that relation.
2. If instead of the proposition, “The sun shines,” we say, “It is true that
the sun shines,” we then speak not directly of things, but of a proposition
concerning things, viz., of the proposition, “The sun shines.” And, therefore,
the proposition in which we thus speak is a secondary one. Every primary
proposition may thus give rise to a secondary proposition, viz., to that secondary
proposition which asserts its truth, or declares its falsehood.
It will usually happen, that the particles if, either, or, will indicate that
a proposition is secondary; but they do not necessarily imply that such is the
case. The proposition, “Animals are either rational or irrational,” is primary. It
cannot be resolved into “Either animals are rational or animals are irrational,”
and it does not therefore express a relation of dependence between the two
propositions connected together in the latter disjunctive sentence. The particles,
either, or, are in fact no criterion of the nature of propositions, although it
happens that they are more frequently found in secondary propositions. Even
the conjunction if may be found in primary propositions. “Men are, if wise,
then temperate,” is an example of the kind. It cannot be resolved into “If all
men are wise, then all men are temperate.”
3. As it is not my design to discuss the merits or defects of the ordinary
division of propositions, I shall simply remark here, that the principle upon
which the present classification is founded is clear and definite in its application,
that it involves a real and fundamental distinction in propositions, and that it
is of essential importance to the development of a general method of reasoning.
Nor does the fact that a primary proposition may be put into a form in which
it becomes secondary at all conflict with the views here maintained. For in the
case thus supposed, it is not of the things connected together in the primary
proposition that any direct account is taken, but only of the proposition itself
considered as true or as false.
4. In the expression both of primary and of secondary propositions, the
same symbols, subject, as it will appear, to the same laws, will be employed
in this work. The difference between the two cases is a difference not of form
but of interpretation. In both cases the actual relation which it is the object
of the proposition to express will be denoted by the sign =. In the expression
of primary propositions, the members thus connected will usually represent the
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 39
“terms” of a proposition, or, as they are more particularly designated, its subject
and predicate.
Proposition II.
5. To deduce a general method, founded upon the enumeration of possible
varieties, for the expression of any class or collection of things, which may
constitute a “term” of a Primary Proposition.
First, If the class or collection of things to be expressed is defined only
by names or qualities common to all the individuals of which it consists, its
expression will consist of a single term, in which the symbols expressive of those
names or qualities will be combined without any connecting sign, as if by the
algebraic process of multiplication. Thus, if x represent opaque substances, y
polished substances, z stones, we shall have,
xyz = opaque polished stones;
xy(1 - z) = opaque polished substances which are not stones;
x(1 - y)(1 - z) = opaque substances which are not polished, and are not
stones;
and so on for any other combination. Let it be observed, that each of these
expressions satisfies the same law of duality, as the individual symbols which it
contains. Thus,
xyz × xyz = xyz;
xy(1 - z) × xy(1 - z) = xy(1 - z);
and so on. Any such term as the above we shall designate as a “class term,”
because it expresses a class of things by means of the common properties or
names of the individual members of such class.
Secondly, If we speak of a collection of things, different portions of which are
defined by different properties, names, or attributes, the expressions for those
different portions must be separately formed, and then connected by the sign +.
But if the collection of which we desire to speak has been formed by excluding
from some wider collection a defined portion of its members, the sign - must
be prefixed to the symbolical expression of the excluded portion. Respecting
the use of these symbols some further observations may be added.
6. Speaking generally, the symbol + is the equivalent of the conjunctions
“and,” “or,” and the symbol -, the equivalent of the preposition “except.” Of
the conjunctions “and” and “or,” the former is usually employed when the collection
to be described forms the subject, the latter when it forms the predicate,
of a proposition. “The scholar and the man of the world desire happiness,” may
be taken as an illustration of one of these cases. “Things possessing utility are
either productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,” may exemplify the other.
Now whenever an expression involving these particles presents itself in a primary
proposition, it becomes very important to know whether the groups or
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 40
classes separated in thought by them are intended to be quite distinct from
each other and mutually exclusive, or not. Does the expression, “Scholars and
men of the world,” include or exclude those who are both? Does the ex-pression,
“Either productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,” include or exclude things
which possess both these qualities? I apprehend that in strictness of meaning
the conjunctions “and,” “or,” do possess the power of separation or exclusion
here referred to; that the formula, “All x’s are either y’s or z’s,” rigorously
interpreted, means, “All x’s are either y’s, but not z’s,” or, “z’s but not y’s.”
But it must at the same time be admitted, that the “jus et norma loquendi”
seems rather to favour an opposite interpretation. The expression, “Either y’s
or z’s,” would generally be understood to include things that are y’s and z’s
at the same time, together with things which come under the one, but not the
other. Remembering, however, that the symbol + does possess the separating
power which has been the subject of discussion, we must resolve any disjunctive
expression which may come before us into elements really separated in thought,
and then connect their respective expressions by the symbol +.
And thus, according to the meaning implied, the expression, “Things which
are either x’s or y’s,” will have two different symbolical equivalents. If we mean,
“Things which are x’s, but not y’s, or y’s, but not x’s,” the expression will be
x(1 - y) + y(1 - x);
the symbol x standing for x’s, y for y’s. If, however, we mean, “Things which
are either x’s, or, if not x’s, then y’s,” the expression will be
x + y(1 - x).
This expression supposes the admissibility of things which are both x’s and y’s
at the same time. It might more fully be expressed in the form
xy + x(1 - y) + y(1 - x);
but this expression, on addition of the two first terms, only reproduces the
former one.
Let it be observed that the expressions above given satisfy the fundamental
law of duality (III. 16). Thus we have
{x(1 - y) + y(1 - x)}
2 = x(1 - y) + y(1 - x),
{x + (1 - x)}
2 = x + y(1 - x).
It will be seen hereafter, that this is but a particular manifestation of a general
law of expressions representing “classes or collections of things.”
7. The results of these investigations may be embodied in the following rule
of expression.
Rule.—Express simple names or qualities by the symbols x, y, z, &c., their
contraries by 1 - x, 1 - y, 1 - z, &c.; classes of things defined by common
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 41
names or qualities, by connecting the corresponding symbols as in multiplication;
collections of things, consisting of portions different from each other, by
connecting the expressions of those portions by the sign +. In particular, let
the expression, “Either x’s or y’s,” be expressed by x(1 - y) + y(1 - x), when
the classes denoted by x and y are exclusive, by x + y(1 - x) when they are not
exclusive. Similarly let the expression, “Either x’s, or y’s, or z’s,” be expressed
by x(1-y)(1-z)+y(1-x)(1-z)+z(1-x)(1-y), when the classes denoted by x,
y, and z, are designed to be mutually exclusive, by x+y(1-x)+z(1-x)(1-y),
when they are not meant to be exclusive, and so on.
8. On this rule of expression is founded the converse rule of interpretation.
Both these will be exemplified with, perhaps, sufficient fulness in the following
instances. Omitting for brevity the universal subject “things,” or “beings,” let
us assume
x = hard, y = elastic, z = metals;
and we shall have the following results:
“Non-elastic metals,” will be expressed by z(1 - y);
“Elastic substances with non-elastic metals,” by y + z(1 - y);
“Hard substances, except metals,” by x - z;
“Metallic substances, except those which are neither hard nor elastic,” by
z - z(1 - x)(1 - y), or by z{1 - (1 - x)(1 - y)}, vide (6), Chap. II.
In the last example, what we had really to express was “Metals, except not
hard, not elastic, metals.” Conjunctions used between adjectives are usually
superfluous, and, therefore, must not be expressed symbolically.
Thus, “Metals hard and elastic,” is equivalent to “Hard elastic metals,” and
expressed by xyz.
Take next the expression, “Hard substances, except those which are metallic
and non-elastic, and those which are elastic and non-metallic.” Here the
word those means hard substances, so that the expression really means, Hard
substances except hard substances, metallic, non-elastic, and hard substances
non-metallic, elastic; the word except extending to both the classes which follow
it. The complete expression is
x - {xz(1 - y) + xy(1 - z)};
or, x - xz(1 - y) - xy(1 - z).
9. The preceding Proposition, with the different illustrations which have
been given of it, is a necessary preliminary to the following one, which will
complete the design of the present chapter.
Proposition III.
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 42
To deduce from an examination of their possible varieties a general method
for the expression of Primary or Concrete Propositions.
A primary proposition, in the most general sense, consists of two terms,
between which a relation is asserted to exist. These terms are not necessarily
single-worded names, but may represent any collection of objects, such as we
have been engaged in considering in the previous sections. The mode of expressing
those terms is, therefore, comprehended in the general precepts above
given, and it only remains to discover how the relations between the terms are
to be expressed. This will evidently depend upon the nature of the relation,
and more particularly upon the question whether, in that relation, the terms
are understood to be universal or particular, i.e. whether we speak of the whole
of that collection of objects to which a term refers, or indefinitely of the whole
or of a part of it, the usual signification of the prefix, “some.”
Suppose that we wish to express a relation of identity between the two
classes, “Fixed Stars” and “Suns,” i.e. to express that “All fixed stars are
suns,” and “All suns are fixed stars.” Here, if x stand for fixed stars, and y for
suns, we shall have
x = y
for the equation required.
In the proposition, “All fixed stars are suns,” the term “all fixed stars” would
be called the subject, and “ suns” the predicate. Suppose that we extend the
meaning of the terms subject and predicate in the following manner. By subject
let us mean the first term of any affirmative proposition, i. e. the term which
precedes the copula is or are; and by predicate let us agree to mean the second
term, i.e. the one which follows the copula; and let us admit the assumption
that either of these may be universal or particular, so that, in either case, the
whole class may be implied, or only a part of it. Then we shall have the following
Rule for cases such as the one in the last example:–
10. Rule.—When both Subject and Predicate of a Proposition are universal,
form the separate expressions for them, and connect them by the sign =.
This case will usually present itself in the expression of the definitions of
science, or of subjects treated after the manner of pure science. Mr. Senior’s
definition of wealth affords a good example of this kind, viz.:
“Wealth consists of things transferable, limited in supply, and either productive
of pleasure or preventive of pain.”
Before proceeding to express this definition symbolically, it must be remarked
that the conjunction and is superfluous. Wealth is really defined by its possession
of three properties or qualities, not by its composition out of three classes
or collections of objects. Omitting then the conjunction and, let us make
w = wealth.
t = things transferable.
s = limited in supply.
p = productive of pleasure.
r = preventive of pain.
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 43
Now it is plain from the nature of the subject, that the expression, “Either
productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,” in the above definition, is meant
to be equivalent to “Either productive of pleasure; or, if not productive of pleasure,
preventive of pain.” Thus the class of things which the above expression,
taken alone, would define, would consist of all things productive of pleasure,
together with all things not productive of pleasure, but preventive of pain, and
its symbolical expression would be
p + (1 - p)r.
If then we attach to this expression placed in brackets to denote that both
its terms are referred to, the symbols s and t limiting its application to things
“transferable” and “limited in supply,” we obtain the following symbolical equivalent
for the original definition, viz.:
w = st{p + r(1 - p)}. (1)
If the expression, “Either productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,” were
intended to point out merely those things which are productive of pleasure
without being preventive of pain, p(1 - r), or preventive of pain, without being
productive of pleasure, r(1-p) (exclusion being made of those things which are
both productive of pleasure and preventive of pain), the expression in symbols
of the definition would be
w = st{p(1 - r) + r(1 - p)}. (2)
All this agrees with what has before been more generally stated. The reader
may be curious to inquire what effect would be produced if we literally translated
the expression, “Things productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,” by p + r,
making the symbolical equation of the definition to be
w = st(p + r). (3)
The answer is, that this expression would be equivalent to (2), with the
additional implication that the classes of things denoted by stp and str are
quite distinct, so that of things transferable and limited in supply there exist
none in the universe which are at the same time both productive of pleasure and
preventive of pain. How the full import of any equation may be determined will
be explained hereafter. What has been said may show that before attempting to
translate our data into the rigorous language of symbols, it is above all things
necessary to ascertain the intended import of the words we are using. But
this necessity cannot be regarded as an evil by those who value correctness of
thought, and regard the right employment of language as both its instrument
and its safeguard.
11. Let us consider next the case in which the predicate of the proposition
is particular, e.g. “All men are mortal.”
In this case it is clear that our meaning is, “All men are some mortal beings,”
and we must seek the expression of the predicate, “some mortal beings.”
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 44
Represent then by v, a class indefinite in every respect but this, viz., that some
of its members are mortal beings, and let x stand for “mortal beings,” then
will vx represent “some mortal beings.” Hence if y represent men, the equation
sought will be
y = vx.
From such considerations we derive the following Rule, for expressing an
affirmative universal proposition whose predicate is particular:
Rule.—Express as before the subject and the predicate, attach to the latter
the indefinite symbol v, and equate the expressions.
It is obvious that v is a symbol of the same kind as x, y, &c., and that it is
subject to the general law,
v
2 = v, orv(1 - v) = 0.
Thus, to express the proposition, “The planets are either primary or secondary,”
we should, according to the rule, proceed thus:
Let x represent planets (the subject);
y = primary bodies;
z = secondary bodies;
then, assuming the conjunction “or” to separate absolutely the class of “primary”
from that of “secondary” bodies, so far as they enter into our consideration
in the proposition given, we find for the equation of the proposition
x = v {y (1 - z) + z (1 - y)} . (4)
It may be worth while to notice, that in this case the literal translation of the
premises into the form
x = v(y + z) (5)
would be exactly equivalent, v being an indefinite class symbol. The form
(4) is, however, the better, as the expression
y (1 - z) + z (1 - y)
consists of terms representing classes quite distinct from each other, and
satisfies the fundamental law of duality.
If we take the proposition, “The heavenly bodies are either suns, or planets,
or comets,” representing these classes of things by w, x, y, z, respectively, its
expression, on the supposition that none of the heavenly bodies belong at once
to two of the divisions above mentioned, will be
w = v {x (1 - y) (1 - z) + y (1 - x) (1 - z) + z (1 - x) (1 - y)}
If, however, it were meant to be implied that the heavenly bodies were
either suns, or, if not suns, planets, or, if neither, suns nor planets, fixed stars,
a meaning which does not exclude the supposition of some of them belonging at
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 45
once to two or to all three of the divisions of suns, planets, and fixed stars,—the
expression required would be
w = v {x + y (1 - x) + z (1 - x) (1 - y)} . (6)
The above examples belong to the class of descriptions, not definitions. Indeed
the predicates of propositions are usually particular. When this is not the
case, either the predicate is a singular term, or we employ, instead of the copula
“is” or “are,” some form of connexion, which implies that the predicate is to be
taken universally.
12. Consider next the case of universal negative propositions, e.g. “No men
are perfect beings.”
Now it is manifest that in this case we do not speak of a class termed “no
men,” and assert of this class that all its members are “perfect beings.” But
we virtually make an assertion about “all men” to the effect that they are “not
perfect beings.” Thus the true meaning of the proposition is this:
“All men (subject) are (copula) not perfect (predicate);” whence, if y represent
“men,” and x “perfect beings,” we shall have
y = v (1 - x),
and similarly in any other case. Thus we have the following Rule:
Rule.—To express any proposition of the form “No x’s are y’s,” convert it
into the form “All x’s are not y’s,” and then proceed as in the previous case.
13. Consider, lastly, the case in which the subject of the proposition is
particular, e.g. “Some men are not wise.” Here, as has been remarked, the
negative not may properly be referred, certainly, at least, for the ends of Logic,
to the predicate wise; for we do not mean to say that it is not true that “Some
men are wise,” but we intend to predicate of “some men” a want of wisdom. The
requisite form of the given proposition is, therefore, “Some men are not-wise.”
Putting, then, y for “men,” x for “wise,” i. e. “wise beings,” and introducing v
as the symbol of a class indefinite in all respects but this, that it contains some
individuals of the class to whose expression it is prefixed, we have
vy = v (1 - x).
14. We may comprise all that we have determined in the following general
Rule:
general rule for the symbolical expression of primary
propositions.
1st. If the proposition is affirmative, form the expression of the subject
and that of the predicate. Should either of them be particular, attach to it the
indefinite symbol v, and then equate the resulting expressions.
2ndly. If the proposition is negative, express first its true meaning by attaching
the negative particle to the predicate, then proceed as above.
One or two additional examples may suffice for illustration.
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 46
Ex.—“No men are placed in exalted stations, and free from envious regards.”
Let y represent “men,” x, “placed in exalted stations,” z, “free from envious
regards.”
Now the expression of the class described as “placed in exalted station,” and
“free from envious regards,” is xz. Hence the contrary class, i.e. they to whom
this description does not apply, will be represented by 1 - xz, and to this class
all men are referred. Hence we have
y = v (1 - xz).
If the proposition thus expressed had been placed in the equiva- lent form, “Men
in exalted stations are not free from envious regards,” its expression would have
been
yx = v (1 - z).
It will hereafter appear that this expression is really equivalent to the previous
one, on the particular hypothesis involved, viz., that v is an indefinite class
symbol.
Ex.—“No men are heroes but those who unite self-denial to courage.”
Let x = “men,” y = “heroes,” z = “those who practise self-denial,” w, “those
who possess courage.”
The assertion really is, that “men who do not possess courage and practise
self-denial are not heroes.”
Hence we have
x (1 - zw) = v (1 - y)
for the equation required.
15. In closing this Chapter it may be interesting to compare together the
great leading types of propositions symbolically expressed. If we agree to represent
by X and Y the symbolical expressions of the “terms,” or things related,
those types will be
X = vY,
X = Y,
vX = vY.
In the first, the predicate only is particular; in the second, both terms are
universal; in the third, both are particular. Some minor forms are really included
under these. Thus, if Y = 0, the second form becomes
X = 0;
and if Y = 1 it becomes
X = 1;
both which forms admit of interpretation. It is further to be noticed, that
the expressions X and Y , if founded upon a sufficiently careful analysis of the
CHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 47
meaning of the “terms” of the proposition, will satisfy the fundamental law of
duality which requires that we have
X2 = X or X (1 - X) = 0,
Y
2 = Y or Y (1 - Y ) = 0.
Chapter V
OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF
SYMBOLICAL REASONING, AND OF THE
EXPANSION OR DEVELOPMENT OF EXPRESSIONS
INVOLVING LOGICAL SYMBOLS.
1. The previous chapters of this work have been devoted to the investigation of
the fundamental laws of the operations of the mind in reasoning; of their development
in the laws of the symbols of Logic; and of the principles of expression,
by which that species of propositions called primary may be represented in the
language of symbols. These inquiries have been in the strictest sense preliminary.
They form an indispensable introduction to one of the chief objects of
this treatise—the construction of a system or method of Logic upon the basis
of an exact summary of the fundamental laws of thought. There are certain
considerations touching the nature of this end, and the means of its attainment,
to which I deem it necessary here to direct attention.
2. I would remark in the first place that the generality of a method in Logic
must very much depend upon the generality of its elementary processes and
laws. We have, for instance, in the previous sections of this work investigated,
among other things, the laws of that logical process of addition which is symbolized
by the sign +. Now those laws have been determined from the study of
instances, in all of which it has been a necessary condition, that the classes or
things added together in thought should be mutually exclusive. The expression
x + y seems indeed uninterpretable, unless it be assumed that the things represented
by x and the things represented by y are entirely separate; that they
embrace no individuals in common. And conditions analogous to this have been
involved in those acts of conception from the study of which the laws of the
other symbolical operations have been ascertained. The question then arises,
whether it is necessary to restrict the application of these symbolical laws and
processes by the same conditions of interpretability under which the knowledge
of them was obtained. If such restriction is necessary, it is manifest that no
such thing as a general method in Logic is possible. On the other hand, if such
restriction is unnecessary, in what light are we to contemplate processes which
appear to be uninterpretable in that sphere of thought which they are designed
to aid? These questions do not belong to the science of Logic alone. They are
48
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 49
equally pertinent to every developed form of human reasoning which is based
upon the employment of a symbolical language.
3. I would observe in the second place, that this apparent failure of correspondency
between process and interpretation does not manifest itself in the
ordinary applications of human reason. For no operations are there performed
of which the meaning and the application are not seen; and to most minds
it does not suffice that merely formal reasoning should connect their premises
and their conclusions; but every step of the connecting train, every mediate
result which is established in the course of demonstration, must be intelligible
also. And without doubt, this is both an actual condition and an important
safeguard, in the reasonings and discourses of common life.
There are perhaps many who would be disposed to extend the same principle
to the general use of symbolical language as an instrument of reasoning. It
might be argued, that as the laws or axioms which govern the use of symbols are
established upon an investigation of those cases only in which interpretation is
possible, we have no right to extend their application to other cases in which interpretation
is impossible or doubtful, even though (as should be admitted) such
application is employed in the intermediate steps of demonstration only. Were
this objection conclusive, it must be acknowledged that slight advantage would
accrue from the use of a symbolical method in Logic. Perhaps that advantage
would be confined to the mechanical gain of employing short and convenient
symbols in the place of more cumbrous ones. But the objection itself is fallacious.
Whatever our `a priori anticipations might be, it is an unquestionable fact
that the validity of a conclusion arrived at by any symbolical process of reasoning,
does not depend upon our ability to interpret the formal results which have
presented themselves in the different stages of the investigation. There exist, in
fact, certain general principles relating to the use of symbolical methods, which,
as pertaining to the particular subject of Logic, I shall first state, and I shall
then offer some remarks upon the nature and upon the grounds of their claim
to acceptance.
4. The conditions of valid reasoning, by the aid of symbols, are—
1st, That a fixed interpretation be assigned to the symbols employed in the
expression of the data; and that the laws of the combination of those symbols
be correctly determined from that interpretation.
2nd, That the formal processes of solution or demonstration be conducted
throughout in obedience to all the laws determined as above, without regard to
the question of the interpretability of the particular results obtained.
3rd, That the final result be interpretable in form, and that it be actually
interpreted in accordance with that system of interpretation which has been employed
in the expression of the data. Concerning these principles, the following
observations may be made.
5. The necessity of a fixed interpretation of the symbols has already been
sufficiently dwelt upon (II. 3). The necessity that the fixed result should be in
such a form as to admit of that interpretation being applied, is founded on the
obvious principle, that the use of symbols is a means towards an end, that end
being the knowledge of some intelligible fact or truth. And that this end may
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 50
be attained, the final result which expresses the symbolical conclusion must be
in an interpretable form. It is, however, in connexion with the second of the
above general principles or conditions (V. 4), that the greatest difficulty is likely
to be felt, and upon this point a few additional words are necessary.
I would then remark, that the principle in question may be considered as
resting upon a general law of the mind, the knowledge of which is not given
to us `a priori, i.e. antecedently to experience, but is derived, like the knowledge
of the other laws of the mind, from the clear manifestation of the general
principle in the particular instance. A single example of reasoning, in which
symbols are employed in obedience to laws founded upon their interpretation,
but without any sustained reference to that interpretation, the chain of demonstration
conducting us through intermediate steps which are not interpretable,
to a final result which is interpretable, seems not only to establish the validity
of the particular application, but to make known to us the general law manifested
therein. No accumulation of instances can properly add weight to such
evidence. It may furnish us with clearer conceptions of that common element
of truth upon which the application of the principle depends, and so prepare
the way for its reception. It may, where the immediate force of the evidence is
not felt, serve as a verification, `a posteriori, of the practical validity of the principle
in question. But this does not affect the position affirmed, viz., that the
general principle must be seen in the particular instance,—seen to be general
in application as well as true in the special example. The employment of the
uninterpretable symbol v
-1, in the intermediate processes of trigonometry, furnishes
an illustration of what has been said. I apprehend that there is no mode
of explaining that application which does not covertly assume the very principle
in question. But that principle, though not, as I conceive, warranted by formal
reasoning based upon other grounds, seems to deserve a place among those axiomatic
truths which constitute, in some sense, the foundation of the possibility
of general knowledge, and which may properly be regarded as expressions of the
mind’s own laws and constitution.
6. The following is the mode in which the principle above stated will be applied
in the present work. It has been seen, that any system of propositions may
be expressed by equations involving symbols x, y, z, which, whenever interpretation
is possible, are subject to laws identical in form with the laws of a system
of quantitative symbols, susceptible only of the values 0 and 1 (II. 15). But as
the formal processes of reasoning depend only upon the laws of the symbols,
and not upon the nature of their interpretation, we are permitted to treat the
above symbols, x, y, z, as if they were quantitative symbols of the kind above
described. We may in fact lay aside the logical interpretation of the symbols
in the given equation; convert them into quantitative symbols, susceptible only
of the values 0 and 1; perform upon them as such all the requisite processes of
solution; and finally restore to them their logical interpretation. And this is the
mode of procedure which will actually be adopted, though it will be deemed
unnecessary to restate in every instance the nature of the transformation employed.
The processes to which the symbols x, y, z, regarded as quantitative
and of the species above described, are subject, are not limited by those condi-
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 51
tions of thought to which they would, if performed upon purely logical symbols,
be subject, and a freedom of operation is given to us in the use of them, without
which, the inquiry after a general method in Logic would be a hopeless quest.
Now the above system of processes would conduct us to no intelligible result,
unless the final equations resulting therefrom were in a form which should render
their interpretation, after restoring to the symbols their logical significance,
possible. There exists, however, a general method of reducing equations to such
a form, and the remainder of this chapter will be devoted to its consideration.
I shall say little concerning the way in which the method renders interpretation
possible,—this point being reserved for the next chapter,—but shall chiefly confine
myself here to the mere process employed, which may be characterized as a
process of “development.” As introductory to the nature of this process, it may
be proper first to make a few observations.
7. Suppose that we are considering any class of things with reference to this
question, viz., the relation in which its members stand as to the possession or
the want of a certain property x. As every individual in the proposed class either
possesses or does not possess the property in question, we may divide the class
into two portions, the former consisting of those individuals which possess, the
latter of those which do not possess, the property. This possibility of dividing
in thought the whole class into two constituent portions, is antecedent to all
knowledge of the constitution of the class derived from any other source; of
which knowledge the effect can only be to inform us, more or less precisely, to
what further conditions the portions of the class which possess and which do
not possess the given property are subject. Suppose, then, such knowledge is
to the following effect, viz., that the members of that portion which possess the
property x, possess also a certain property u, and that these conditions united
are a sufficient definition of them. We may then represent that portion of the
original class by the expression ux (II. 6). If, further, we obtain information
that the members of the original class which do not possess the property x, are
subject to a condition v, and are thus defined, it is clear, that those members
will be represented by the expression v (1 - x). Hence the class in its totality
will be represented by
ux + v (1 - x) ;
which may be considered as a general developed form for the expression of any
class of objects considered with reference to the possession or the want of a
given property x.
The general form thus established upon purely logical grounds may also be
deduced from distinct considerations of formal law, applicable to the symbols
x, y, z, equally in their logical and in their quantitative interpretation already
referred to (V. 6).
8. Definition.—Any algebraic expression involving a symbol x is termed a
function of x, and may be represented under the abbreviated general form f (x).
Any expression involving two symbols, x and y, is similarly termed a function
of x and y, and may be represented under the general form f (x, y), and so on
for any other case.
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 52
Thus the form f (x) would indifferently represent any of the following functions,
viz., x, 1 - x,
1+x
1-x
, &c.; and f (x, y) would equally represent any of the
forms x + y, x - 2y,
x+y
x-2y
, &c.
On the same principles of notation, if in any function f (x) we change x into
1, the result will be expressed by the form f (1); if in the same function we
change x into 0, the result will be expressed by the form f (0). Thus, if f (x)
represent the function a+x
a-2x
, f (1) will represent a+1
a-2
, and f (0) will represent
a
a
.
9. Definition.—Any function f (x), in which x is a logical symbol, or a
symbol of quantity susceptible only of the values 0 and 1, is said to be developed,
when it is reduced to the form ax + b (1 - x), a and b being so determined as
to make the result equivalent to the function from which it was derived.
This definition assumes, that it is possible to represent any function f (x) in
the form supposed. The assumption is vindicated in the following Proposition.
Proposition I.
10. To develop any function f (x) in which x is a logical symbol.
By the principle which has been asserted in this chapter, it is lawful to treat
x as a quantitative symbol, susceptible only of the values 0 and 1.
Assume then,
f (x) = ax + b (1 - x),
and making x = 1, we have
f (1) = a.
Again, in the same equation making x = 0, we have
f (0) = b.
Hence the values of a and b are determined, and substituting them in the first
equation, we have
f (x) = f (1) x + f (0) (1 - x) ; (1)
as the development sought.1 The second member of the equation adequately
represents the function f (x), whatever the form of that function may be. For
1To some it may be interesting to remark, that the development of f (x) obtained in this
chapter, strictly holds, in the logical system, the place of the expansion of f (x) in ascending
powers of x in the system of ordinary algebra. Thus it may be obtained by introducing into
the expression of Taylor’s well-known theorem, viz.:
f (x) = f (0) + f
0
(0) x + f
00 (0) x
2
1 · 2
+ f
000 (0) x
3
1 · 2 · 3
, &c. (1)
the condition x(1 - x) = 0, whence we find x
2 = x, x
3 = x, &c., and
f (x) = f (0) + 
f
0
(0) + f
00 (0)
1 · 2
+
f
000 (0)
1 · 2 · 3
+ &c.
x. (2)
But making in (1), x = 1, we get
f(1) = f(0) + f
0
(0) + f
00(0)
1 · 2
+
f
000(0)
1 · 2 · 3
+ &c.
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 53
x regarded as a quantitative symbol admits only of the values 0 and 1, and for
each of these values the development
f (1) x + f (0) (1 - x),
assumes the same value as the function f (x).
As an illustration, let it be required to develop the function 1+x
1+2x
. Here,
when x = 1, we find f (1) = 2
3
, and when x = 0, we find f (0) = 1
1
, or 1. Hence
the expression required is
1 + x
1 + 2x
=
2
3
x + 1 - x ;
and this equation is satisfied for each of the values of which the symbol x is
susceptible.
Proposition II.
To expand or develop a function involving any number of logical symbols.
Let us begin with the case in which there are two symbols, x and y, and let
us represent the function to be developed by f (x, y).
First, considering f (x, y) as a function of x alone, and expanding it by the
general theorem (1), we have
f (x, y) = f (1, y) x + f (0, y) (1 - x) ; (2)
wherein f (1, y) represents what the proposed function becomes, when in it
for x; we write 1, and f (0, y) what the said function becomes, when in it for x
we write 0.
Now, taking the coefficient f (1, y), and regarding it as a function of y, and
expanding it accordingly, we have
f (1, y) = f (1, 1) y + f (1, 0) (1 - y), (3)
wherein f (1, 1) represents what f (1, y) becomes when y is made equal to 1, and
f (1, 0) what f (1, y) becomes when y is made equal to 0.
In like manner, the coefficient f (0, y) gives by expansion,
f (0, y) = f (0, 1) y + f (0, 0) (1 - y). (4)
whence
f
0
(0) + f
00(0)
1 · 2
+ &c. = f(1) - f(0),
and (2) becomes, on substitution,
f(x) = f(0) + {f(1) - f(0)}x,
= f(1)x + f(0)(1 - x),
the form in question. This demonstration in supposing f (x) to be developable in a series of
ascending powers of x is less general than the one in the text.
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 54
Substitute in (2) for f (1, y), f (0, y), their values given in (3) and (4), and we
have
f (x, y) = f (1, 1) xy + f (1, 0) x (1 - y) + f (0, 1) (1 - x) y (5)
+f (0, 0) (1 - x) (1 - y), (6)
for the expansion required. Here f (1, 1) represents what f (x, y) becomes when
we make therein x = 1, y = 1; f (1, 0) represents what f (x, y) becomes when
we make therein x = 1, y = 0, and so on for the rest.
Thus, if f (x, y) represent the function 1-x
1-y
, we find
f (1, 1) = 0
0
, f (1, 0) = 0
1
, f (0, 1) = 1
0
, f (0, 0) = 1
whence the expansion of the given function is
0
0
xy + 0x (1 - y) + 1
0
(1 - x) y + (1 - x) (1 - y).
It will in the next chapter be seen that the forms 0
0
and 1
0
, the former of which
is known to mathematicians as the symbol of indeterminate quantity, admit, in
such expressions as the above, of a very important logical interpretation.
Suppose, in the next place, that we have three symbols in the function
to be expanded, which we may represent under the general form f (x, y, z).
Proceeding as before, we get
f (x, y, z) = f (1, 1, 1) xyz + f (1, 1, 0) xy (1 - z) + f (1, 0, 1) x (1 - y) z
+ f (1, 0, 0) x (1 - y) (1 - z) + f (0, 1, 1) (1 - x) yz
+ f (0, 1, 0) (1 - x) y (1 - z) + f (0, 0, 1) (1 - x) (1 - y) z
+ f (0, 0, 0) (1 - x) (1 - y) (1 - z)
in which f (1, 1, 1) represents what the function f (x, y, z) becomes when we
make therein x = 1, y = 1, z = 1, and so on for the rest.
11. It is now easy to see the general law which determines the expansion
of any proposed function, and to reduce the method of effecting the expansion
to a rule. But before proceeding to the expression of such a rule, it will be
convenient to premise the following observations:—
Each form of expansion that we have obtained consists of certain terms,
into which the symbols x, y, &c. enter, multiplied by coefficients, into which
those symbols do not enter. Thus the expansion of f (x) consists of two terms,
x and 1 - x, multiplied by the coefficients f (1) and f (0) respectively. And
the expansion of f (x, y) consists of the four terms xy, x (1 - y), (1 - x) y, and
(1 - x), (1 - y), multiplied by the coefficients f (1, 1), f (1, 0), f (0, 1), f (0, 0),
respectively. The terms x, 1-x, in the former case, and the terms xy, x (1 - y),
&c., in the latter, we shall call the constituents of the expansion. It is evident
that they are in form independent of the form of the function to be expanded.
Of the constituent xy, x and y are termed the factors.
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 55
The general rule of development will therefore consist of two parts, the first
of which will relate to the formation of the constituents of the expansion, the
second to the determination of their respective coefficients. It is as follows:
1st. To expand any function of the symbols x, y, z.—Form a series of constituents
in the following manner: Let the first constituent be the product of
the symbols; change in this product any symbol z into 1 - z, for the second
constituent. Then in both these change any other symbol y into 1 - y, for
two more constituents. Then in the four constituents thus obtained change any
other symbol x into 1-x, for four new constituents, and so on until the number
of possible changes is exhausted.
2ndly. To find the coefficient of any constituent.—If that constituent involves
x as a factor, change in the original function x into 1; but if it involves 1 - x
as a factor, change in the original function x into 0. Apply the same rule with
reference to the symbols y, z, &c.: the final calculated value of the function
thus transformed will be the coefficient sought.
The sum of the constituents, multiplied each by its respective coefficient,
will be the expansion required.
12. It is worthy of observation, that a function may be developed with
reference to symbols which it does not explicitly contain. Thus if, proceeding
according to the rule, we seek to develop the function 1 - x, with reference to
the symbols x and y, we have,
When x = 1 and y = 1 the given function = 0.
x = 1 ” y = 0 ” ” = 0.
x = 0 ” y = 1 ” ” = 1.
x = 0 ” y = 0 ” ” = 1.
Whence the development is
1 - x = 0xy + 0x (1 - y) + (1 - x) y + (1 - x) (1 - y) ;
and this is a true development. The addition of the terms (1 - x) y and
(1 - x) (1 - y) produces the function 1 - x.
The symbol 1 thus developed according to the rule, with respect to the
symbol x, gives
x + 1 - x.
Developed with respect to x and y, it gives
xy + x (1 - y) + (1 - x) y + (1 - x) (1 - y).
Similarly developed with respect to any set of symbols, it produces a series
consisting of all possible constituents of those symbols.
13. A few additional remarks concerning the nature of the general expansions
may with propriety be added. Let us take, for illustration, the general theorem
(5), which presents the type of development for functions of two logical symbols.
In the first place, that theorem is perfectly true and intelligible when x and
y are quantitative symbols of the species considered in this chapter, whatever
algebraic form may be assigned to the function f (x, y), and it may therefore be
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 56
intelligibly employed in any stage of the process of analysis intermediate between
the change of interpretation of the symbols from the logical to the quantitative
system above referred to, and the final restoration of the logical interpretation.
Secondly. The theorem is perfectly true and intelligible when x and y are
logical symbols, provided that the form of the function f (x, y) is such as to
represent a class or collection of things, in which case the second member is
always logically interpretable. For instance, if f (x, y) represent the function
1 - x + xy, we obtain on applying the theorem
1 - x + xy = xy + 0x (1 - y) + (1 - x) y + (1 - x) (1 - y),
= xy + (1 - x) y + (1 - x) (1 - y),
and this result is intelligible and true.
Thus we may regard the theorem as true and intelligible for quantitative
symbols of the species above described, always; for logical symbols, always when
interpretable. Whensoever therefore it is employed in this work it must be
understood that the symbols x, y are quantitative and of the particular species
referred to, if the expansion obtained is not interpretable.
But though the expansion is not always immediately interpretable, it always
conducts us at once to results which are interpretable. Thus the expression x-y
gives on development the form
x (1 - y) - y (1 - x),
which is not generally interpretable. We cannot take, in thought, from the class
of things which are x’s and not y’s, the class of things which are y’s and not x’s,
because the latter class is not contained in the former. But if the form x - y
presented itself as the first member of an equation, of which the second member
was 0, we should have on development
x (1 - y) - y (1 - x) = 0.
Now it will be shown in the next chapter that the above equation, x and y being
regarded as quantitative and of the species described, is resolvable at once into
the two equations
x (1 - y) = 0, y (1 - x) = 0,
and these equations are directly interpretable in Logic when logical interpretations
are assigned to the symbols x and y. And it may be remarked, that
though functions do not necessarily become interpretable upon development,
yet equations are always reducible by this process to interpretable forms.
14. The following Proposition establishes some important properties of constituents.
In its enunciation the symbol t is employed to represent indifferently
any constituent of an expansion. Thus if the expansion is that of a function of
two symbols x and y, t represents any of the four forms xy, x (1 - y), (1 - x) y,
and (1 - x) (1 - y). Where it is necessary to represent the constituents of an
expansion by single symbols, and yet to distinguish them from each other, the
distinction will be marked by suffixes. Thus t1 might be employed to represent
xy, t2 to represent x (1 - y), and so on.
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 57
Proposition III.
Any single constituent t of an expansion satisfies the law of duality whose
expression is
t(1 - t) = 0.
The product of any two distinct constituents of an expansion is equal to 0, and
the sum of all the constituents is equal to 1.
1st. Consider the particular constituent xy. We have
xy × xy = x
2
y
2
.
But x
2 = x, y
2 = y, by the fundamental law of class symbols; hence
xy × xy = xy.
Or representing xy by t,
t × t = t,
or
t(1 - t) = 0.
Similarly the constituent x (1 - y) satisfies the same law. For we have
x
2 = x,(1 - y)
2 = 1 - y,
? {x (1 - y)}
2 = x (1 - y), or t(1 - t) = 0.
Now every factor of every constituent is either of the form x or of the form 1-x.
Hence the square of each factor is equal to that factor, and therefore the square
of the product of the factors, i.e. of the constituent, is equal to the constituent;
wherefore t representing any constituent, we have
t
2 = t, or t(1 - t) = 0.
2ndly. The product of any two constituents is 0. This is evident from the
general law of the symbols expressed by the equation x (1 - x) = 0; for whatever
constituents in the same expansion we take, there will be at least one factor x
in the one, to which will correspond a factor 1 - x in the other.
3rdly. The sum of all the constituents of an expansion is unity. This is
evident from addition of the two constituents x and 1 - x, or of the four constituents,
xy, x(1-y), (1-x)y, (1-x)(1-y). But it is also, and more generally,
proved by expanding 1 in terms of any set of symbols (V. 12). The constituents
in this case are formed as usual, and all the coefficients are unity.
15. With the above Proposition we may connect the following.
Proposition IV.
CHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 58
If V represent the sum of any series of constituents, the separate coefficients
of which are 1, then is the condition satisfied,
V (1 - V ) = 0
Let t1, t2 . . .tn be the constituents in question, then
V = t1 + t2 · · · + tn.
Squaring both sides, and observing that t
2
1 = t1, t1t2, = 0, &c., we have
V
2 = t1 + t2 · · · + tn;
whence
V = V
2
.
Therefore
V (1 - V ) = 0.
Chapter VI
OF THE GENERAL INTERPRETATION OF LOGICAL
EQUATIONS, AND THE RESULTING ANALYSIS OF
PROPOSITIONS. ALSO, OF THE CONDITION OF
INTERPRETABILITY OF LOGICAL FUNCTIONS.
1. It has been observed that the complete expansion of any function by the
general rule demonstrated in the last chapter, involves two distinct sets of elements,
viz., the constituents of the expansion, and their coefficients. I propose
in the present chapter to inquire, first, into the interpretation of constituents,
and afterwards into the mode in which that interpretation is modified by the
coefficients with which they are connected.
The terms “logical equation,” “logical function,” &c., will be employed generally
to denote any equation or function involving the symbols x, y, &c., which
may present itself either in the expression of a system of premises, or in the train
of symbolical results which intervenes between the premises and the conclusion.
If that function or equation is in a form not immediately interpretable in Logic,
the symbols x, y, &c., must be regarded as quantitative symbols of the species
described in previous chapters (II. 15), (V. 6), as satisfying the law,
x (1 - x) = 0.
By the problem, then, of the interpretation of any such logical function or
equation, is meant the reduction of it to a form in which, when logical values are
assigned to the symbols x, y, &c., it shall become interpretable, together with
the resulting interpretation. These conventional definitions are in accordance
with the general principles for the conducting of the method of this treatise,
laid down in the previous chapter.
Proposition I.
2. The constituents of the expansion of any function of the logical symbols
x, y, &c., are interpretable, and represent the several exclusive divisions of the
universe of discourse, formed by the predication and denial in every possible way
of the qualities denoted by the symbols x, y, &c.
59
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 60
For greater distinctness of conception, let it be supposed that the function
expanded involves two symbols x and y, with reference to which the expansion
has been effected. We have then the following constituents, viz.:
xy, x (1 - y), (1 - x) y, (1 - x) (1 - y).
Of these it is evident, that the first xy represents that class of objects which
at the same time possess both the elementary qualities expressed by x and y,
and that the second x (1 - y) represents the class possessing the property x, but
not the property y. In like manner the third constituent represents the class of
objects which possess the property represented by y, but not that represented
by x; and the fourth constituent (1 - x) (1 - y), represents that class of objects,
the members of which possess neither of the qualities in question.
Thus the constituents in the case just considered represent all the four classes
of objects which can be described by affirmation and denial of the properties
expressed by x and y. Those classes are distinct from each other. No member
of one is a member of another, for each class possesses some property or quality
contrary to a property or quality possessed by any other class. Again, these
classes together make up the universe, for there is no object which may not be
described by the presence or the absence of a proposed quality, and thus each
individual thing in the universe may be referred to some one or other of the four
classes made by the possible combination of the two given classes x and y, and
their contraries.
The remarks which have here been made with reference to the constituents
of f (x, y) are perfectly general in character. The constituents of any expansion
represent classes—those classes are mutually distinct, through the possession of
contrary qualities, and they together make up the universe of discourse.
3. These properties of constituents have their expression in the theorems
demonstrated in the conclusion of the last chapter, and might thence have been
deduced. From the fact that every constituent satisfies the fundamental law of
the individual symbols, it might have been conjectured that each constituent
would represent a class. From the fact that the product of any two constituents
of an expansion vanishes, it might have been concluded that the classes they
represent are mutually exclusive. Lastly, from the fact that the sum of the
constituents of an expansion is unity, it might have been inferred, that the
classes which they represent, together make up the universe.
4. Upon the laws of constituents and the mode of their interpretation above
determined, are founded the analysis and the interpretation of logical equations.
That all such equations admit of interpretation by the theorem of development
has already been stated. I propose here to investigate the forms of possible
solution which thus present themselves in the conclusion of a train of reasoning,
and to show how those forms arise. Although, properly speaking, they are but
manifestations of a single fundamental type or principle of expression, it will
conduce to clearness of apprehension if the minor varieties which they exhibit
are presented separately to the mind.
The forms, which are three in number, are as follows:
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 61
form i.
5. The form we shall first consider arises when any logical equation V = 0
is developed, and the result, after resolution into its component equations, is
to be interpreted. The function is supposed to involve the logical symbols x, y,
&c., in combinations which are not fractional. Fractional combinations indeed
only arise in the class of problems which will be considered when we come to
speak of the third of the forms of solution above referred to.
Proposition II.
To interpret the logical equation V = 0.
For simplicity let us suppose that V involves but two symbols, x and y, and
let us represent the development of the given equation by
axy + bx (1 - y) + c (1 - x) y + d (1 - x) (1 - y) = 0; (1)
a, b, c, and d being definite numerical constants.
Now, suppose that any coefficient, as a, does not vanish. Then multiplying
each side of the equation by the constituent xy, to which that coefficient is
attached, we have
axy = 0,
whence, as a does not vanish,
xy = 0,
and this result is quite independent of the nature of the other coefficients of the
expansion. Its interpretation, on assigning to x and y their logical significance,
is “No individuals belonging at once to the class represented by x, and the class
represented by y, exist.”
But if the coefficient a does vanish, the term axy does not appear in the
development (1), and, therefore, the equation xy = 0 cannot thence be deduced.
In like manner, if the coefficient b does not vanish, we have
x (1 - y) = 0,
which admits of the interpretation, “There are no individuals which at the same
time belong to the class x, and do not belong to the class y.”
Either of the above interpretations may, however, as will subsequently be
shown, be exhibited in a different form.
The sum of the distinct interpretations thus obtained from the several terms
of the expansion whose coefficients do not vanish, will constitute the complete
interpretation of the equation V = 0. The analysis is essentially independent of
the number of logical symbols involved in the function V , and the object of the
proposition will, therefore, in all instances, be attained by the following Rule: –
Rule.—Develop the function V , and equate to 0 every constituent whose
coefficient does not vanish. The interpretation of these results collectively will
constitute the interpretation of the given equation.
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 62
6. Let us take as an example the definition of “clean beasts,” laid down in
the Jewish law, viz., “Clean beasts are those which both divide the hoof and
chew the cud,” and let us assume
x = clean beasts;
y = beasts dividing the hoof;
z = beasts chewing the cud;
Then the given proposition will be represented
by the equation
x = yz
which we shall reduce to the form
x - yz = 0,
and seek that form of interpretation to which the present method leads. Fully
developing the first member, we have
0xyz + xy (1 - z) + x (1 - y) z + x (1 - y) (1 - z)
- (1 - x) yz + 0 (1 - x) y (1 - z) + 0 (1 - x) (1 - y) z + 0 (1 - x) (1 - y) (1 - z).
Whence the terms, whose coefficients do not vanish, give
xy (1 - z) = 0, xz (1 - y) = 0, x (1 - y) (1 - z) = 0, (1 - x) yz = 0.
These equations express a denial of the existence of certain classes of objects,
viz.:
1st. Of beasts which are clean, and divide the hoof, but do not chew the
cud.
2nd. Of beasts which are clean, and chew the cud, but do not divide the
hoof.
3rd. Of beasts which are clean, and neither divide the hoof nor chew the
cud.
4th. Of beasts which divide the hoof, and chew the cud, and are not clean.
Now all these several denials are really involved in the original proposition.
And conversely, if these denials be granted, the original proposition will follow as
a necessary consequence. They are, in fact, the separate elements of that proposition.
Every primary proposition can thus be resolved into a series of denials
of the existence of certain defined classes of things, and may, from that system
of denials, be itself reconstructed. It might here be asked, how it is possible
to make an assertive proposition out of a series of denials or negations? From
what source is the positive element derived? I answer, that the mind assumes
the existence of a universe not `a priori as a fact independent of experience,
but either `a posteriori as a deduction from experience, or hypothetically as a
foundation of the possibility of assertive reasoning. Thus from the Proposition,
“There are no men who are not fallible,” which is a negation or denial of the
existence of “infallible men,” it may be inferred either hypothetically, “All men
(if men exist) are fallible,” or absolutely, (experience having assured us of the
existence of the race), “All men are fallible.”
The form in which conclusions are exhibited by the method of this Proposition
may be termed the form of “Single or Conjoint Denial.”
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 63
form ii.
7. As the previous form was derived from the development and interpretation
of an equation whose second member is 0, the present form, which is
supplementary to it, will be derived from the development and interpretation
of an equation whose second member is 1. It is, however, readily suggested by
the analysis of the previous Proposition.
Thus in the example last discussed we deduced from the equation
x - yz = 0
the conjoint denial of the existence of the classes represented by the constituents
xy (1 - z), xz (1 - y), x (1 - y) (1 - z), (1 - x) yz,
whose coefficients were not equal to 0. It follows hence that the remaining
constituents represent classes which make up the universe. Hence we shall have
xyz + (1 - x) y (1 - z) + (1 - x) (1 - y) z + (1 - x) (1 - y) (1 - z) = 1.
This is equivalent to the affirmation that all existing things belong to some one
or other of the following classes, viz.:
1st. Clean beasts both dividing the hoof and chewing the cud.
2nd. Unclean beasts dividing the hoof, but not chewing the cud.
3rd. Unclean beasts chewing the cud, but not dividing the hoof.
4th. Things which are neither clean beasts, nor chewers of the cud, nor
dividers of the hoof.
This form of conclusion may be termed the form of “Single or Disjunctive
Affirmation,”—single when but one constituent appears in the final equation;
disjunctive when, as above, more constituents than one are there found.
Any equation, V = 0, wherein V satisfies the law of duality, may also be
made to yield this form of interpretation by reducing it to the form 1 - V = 1,
and developing the first member. The case, however, is really included in the
next general form. Both the previous forms are of slight importance compared
with the following one.
form iii.
8. In the two preceding cases the functions to be developed were equated to
0 and to 1 respectively. In the present case I shall suppose the corresponding
function equated to any logical symbol w. We are then to endeavour to interpret
the equation V = w, V being a function of the logical symbols x, y, z, &c. In
the first place, however, I deem it necessary to show how the equation V = w,
or, as it will usually present itself, w = V , arises.
Let us resume the definition of “clean beasts,” employed in the previous
examples, viz., “Clean beasts are those which both divide the hoof and chew
the cud,” and suppose it required to determine the relation in which “beasts
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 64
chewing the cud” stand to “clean beasts” and “beasts dividing the hoof.” The
equation expressing the given proposition is
x = yz,
and our object will be accomplished if we can determine z as an interpretable
function of x and y.
Now treating x, y, z as symbols of quantity subject to a peculiar law, we
may deduce from the above equation, by solution,
z =
x
y
.
But this equation is not at present in an interpretable form. If we can reduce
it to such a form it will furnish the relation required.
On developing the second member of the above equation, we have
z = xy +
1
0
x (1 - y) + 0 (1 - x) y +
0
0
(1 - x) (1 - y),
and it will be shown hereafter (Prop. 3) that this admits of the following
interpretation:
“Beasts which chew the cud consist of all clean beasts (which also divide
the hoof), together with an indefinite remainder (some, none, or all) of unclean
beasts which do not divide the hoof.”
9. Now the above is a particular example of a problem of the utmost generality
in Logic, and which may thus be stated:—“Given any logical equation
connecting the symbols x, y, z, w, required an interpretable expression for the
relation of the class represented by w to the classes represented by the other
symbols x, y, z, &c.”
The solution of this problem consists in all cases in determining, from the
equation given, the expression of the above symbol w, in terms of the other
symbols, and rendering that expression interpretable by development. Now the
equation given is always of the first degree with respect to each of the symbols
involved. The required expression for w can therefore always be found. In fact,
if we develop the given equation, whatever its form may be with respect to w,
we obtain an equation of the form
Ew + E
0
(1 - w) = 0, (1)
E and E0 being functions of the remaining symbols. From the above we have
E
0 = (E
0 - E) w.
Therefore
w =
E0
E0 - E
(2)
and expanding the second member by the rule of development, it will only
remain to interpret the result in logic by the next proposition.
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 65
If the fraction E
0
E0-E
has common factors in its numerator and denominator,
we are not permitted to reject them, unless they are mere numerical constants.
For the symbols x, y, &c., regarded as quantitative, may admit of such values 0
and 1 as to cause the common factors to become equal to 0, in which case the
algebraic rule of reduction fails. This is the case contemplated in our remarks on
the failure of the algebraic axiom of division (II. 14). To express the solution in
the form (2), and without attempting to perform any unauthorized reductions,
to interpret the result by the theorem of development, is a course strictly in
accordance with the general principles of this treatise.
If the relation of the class expressed by 1 - w to the other classes, x, y, &c.
is required, we deduce from (1), in like manner as above,
1 - w =
E
E - E0
,
to the interpretation of which also the method of the following Proposition is
applicable:
Proposition III.
10. To determine the interpretation of any logical equation of the form w =
V , in which w is a class symbol, and V a function of other class symbols quite
unlimited in its form.
Let the second member of the above equation be fully expanded. Each
coefficient of the result will belong to some one of the four classes, which, with
their respective interpretations, we proceed to discuss.
1st. Let the coefficient be 1. As this is the symbol of the universe, and
as the product of any two class symbols represents those individuals which are
found in both classes, any constituent which has unity for its coefficient must
be interpreted without limitation, i.e. the whole of the class which it represents
is implied.
2nd. Let the coefficient be 0. As in Logic, equally with Arithmetic, this is
the symbol of Nothing, no part of the class represented by the constituent to
which it is prefixed must be taken.
3rd. Let the coefficient be of the form 0
0
. Now, as in Arithmetic, the symbol
0
0
represents an indefinite number, except when otherwise determined by some
special circumstance, analogy would suggest that in the system of this work the
same symbol should represent an indefinite class. That this is its true meaning
will be made clear from the following example:
Let us take the Proposition, “Men not mortal do not exist;” represent this
Proposition by symbols; and seek, in obedience to the laws to which those
symbols have been proved to be subject, a reverse definition of “mortal beings,”
in terms of “men.”
Now if we represent “men” by y, and “mortal beings” by x, the Proposition,
“Men who are not mortals do not exist,” will be expressed by the equation
y (1 - x) = 0,
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 66
from which we are to seek the value of x. Now the above equation gives
y - yx = 0, or yx = y.
Were this an ordinary algebraic equation, we should, in the next place, divide
both sides of it by y. But it has been remarked in Chap. 11. that the operation
of division cannot be performed with the symbols with which we are now
engaged. Our resource, then, is to express the operation, and develop the result
by the method of the preceding chapter. We have, then, first,
x =
y
y
,
and, expanding the second member as directed,
x = y +
0
0
(1 - y).
This implies that mortals (x) consist of all men (y), together with such a remainder
of beings which are not men (1 - y), as be indicated by the coefficient
0
0
. Now let us inquire what remainder of “not men” is implied by the premiss. It
might happen that the remainder included all the beings who are not men, or it
might include only some of them, and not others, or it might include none, and
any one of these assumptions would be in perfect accordance with our premiss.
In other words, whether those beings which are not men are all, or some, or
none, of them mortal, the truth of the premiss which virtually asserts that all
men are mortal, will be equally unaffected, and therefore the expression 0
0
here
indicates that all, some, or none of the class to whose expression it is affixed
must be taken.
Although the above determination of the significance of the symbol 0
0
is
founded only upon the examination of a particular case, yet the principle involved
in the demonstration is general, and there are no circumstances under
which the symbol can present itself to which the same mode of analysis is inapplicable.
We may properly term 0
0
an indefinite class symbol, and may, if
convenience should require, replace it by an uncompounded symbol v, subject
to the fundamental law, v(1 - v) = 0.
4th. It may happen that the coefficient of a constituent in an expansion does
not belong to any of the previous cases. To ascertain its true interpretation when
this happens, it will be necessary to premise the following theorem:
11. Theorem.—If a function V , intended to represent any class or collection
of objects, w, be expanded, and if the numerical coefficient, a, of any
constituent in its development, do not satisfy the law.
a (1 - a) = 0,
then the constituent in question must be made equal to 0.
To prove the theorem generally, let us represent the expansion given, under
the form
w = a1t1 + a2t2 + a3t3 + &c., (1)
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 67
in which t1, t2, t3, &c. represent the constituents, and a1, a2, a3, &c. the
coefficients; let us also suppose that a1 and a2 do not satisfy the law
a1 (1 - a1) = 0, a2 (1 - a2) = 0;
but that the other coefficients are subject to the law in question, so that we
have
a3
2 = a3, &c.
Now multiply each side of the equation (1) by itself. The result will be
w = a1
2
t1 + a2
2
t2 + &c. (2)
This is evident from the fact that it must represent the development of the
equation
w = V
2
,
but it may also be proved by actually squaring (1), and observing that we have
t1
2 = t1, t2
2 = t2, t1t2 = 0, &c.
by the properties of constituents. Now subtracting (2) from (1), we have

a1 - a1
2

t1 +

a2 - a2
2

t2 = 0.
Or,
a1 (1 - a1)t1 + a2 (1 - a2)t2 = 0.
Multiply the last equation by t1; then since t1t2 = 0, we have
a1 (1 - a1)t1 = 0, whence t2 = 0.
In like manner multiplying the same equation by t2, we have
a2 (1 - a2)t2 = 0, whence t2 = 0.
Thus it may be shown generally that any constituent whose coefficient is
not subject to the same fundamental law as the symbols themselves must be
separately equated to 0. The usual form under which such coefficients occur
is 1
0
. This is the algebraic symbol of infinity. Now the nearer any number
approaches to infinity (allowing such an expression), the more does it depart
from the condition of satisfying the fundamental law above referred to.
The symbol 0
0
, whose interpretation was previously discussed, does not necessarily
disobey the law we are here considering, for it admits of the numerical
values 0 and 1 indifferently. Its actual interpretation, however, as an indefinite
class symbol, cannot, I conceive, except upon the ground of analogy, be deduced
from its arithmetical properties, but must be established experimentally.
12. We may now collect the results to which we have been led, into the
following summar
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 68
1st. The symbol 1, as the coefficient of a term in a development, indicates
that the whole of the class which that constituent represents, is to be taken.
2nd. The coefficient 0 indicates that none of the class are to be taken.
3rd. The symbol 0
0
indicates that a perfectly indefinite portion of the class,
i.e. some, none, or all of its members are to be taken.
4th. Any other symbol as a coefficient indicates that the constituent to
which it is prefixed must be equated to 0.
It follows hence that if the solution of a problem, obtained by development,
be of the form
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D,
that solution may be resolved into the two following equations, viz.,
w = A + vC, (3)
D = O, (4)
v being an indefinite class symbol. The interpretation of (3) shows what elements
enter, or may enter, into the composition of w, the class of things whose
definition is required; and the interpretation of (4) shows what relations exist
among the elements of the original problem, in perfect independence of w.
Such are the canons of interpretation. It may be added, that they are universal
in their application, and that their use is always unembarrassed by exception
or failure.
13. Corollary.–If V be an independently interpretable logical function, it
will satisfy the symbolical law, V (1 - V ) = 0.
By an independently interpretable logical function, I mean one which is
interpretable, without presupposing any relation among the things represented
by the symbols which it involves. Thus x(1 - y) is independently interpretable,
but x - y is not so. The latter function presupposes, as a condition of its
interpretation, that the class represented by y is wholly contained in the class
represented by x; the former function does not imply any such requirement.
Now if V be independently interpretable, and if w represent the collection
of individuals which it contains, the equation w = V will hold true without
entailing as a consequence the vanishing of any of the constituents in the development
of V ; since such vanishing of constituents would imply relations among
the classes of things denoted by the symbols in V . Hence the development of V
will be of the form
a1t1 + a2t2 + &c.
the coefficients a1, a2, &c. all satisfying the condition
a1(1 - a1) = 0, a2(1 - a2) = 0, &c.
Hence by the reasoning of Prop. 4, Chap. v. the function V will be subject
to the law
V (1 - V ) = 0.
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 69
This result, though evident `a priori from the fact that V is supposed to
represent a class or collection of things, is thus seen to follow also from the
properties of the constituents of which it is composed. The condition V (1-V ) =
0 may be termed “the condition of interpretability of logical functions.”
14. The general form of solutions, or logical conclusions developed in the
last Proposition, may be designated as a “Relation between terms.” I use, as
before, the word “terms” to denote the parts of a proposition, whether simple
or complex, which are connected by the copula “is” or “are.” The classes of
things represented by the individual symbols may be called the elements of the
proposition.
15. Ex. 1.–Resuming the definition of “clean beasts,” (VI.6), required a
description of “unclean beasts.”
Here, as before, x standing for “ clean beasts,” y for “beasts dividing the
hoof,” z for “beasts chewing the cud,” we have
x = yz; (5)
whence
1 - x = 1 - yz;
and developing the second member,
1 - x = y(1 - z) + z(1 - y) + (1 - y)(1 - z);
which is interpretable into the following Proposition: Unclean beasts are all
which divide the hoof without chewing the cud, all which chew the cud without
dividing the hoof, and all which neither divide the hoof nor chew the cud.
Ex. 2.–The same definition being given, required a description of beasts
which do not divide the hoof.
From the equation x = yz we have
y =
x
z
;
therefore,
1 - y =
z - x
z
;
and developing the second member,
1 - y = 0 xz +
-1
0
x(1 - z) + (1 - x)z +
0
0
(1 - x)(1 - z).
s Here, according to the Rule, the term whose coefficients is -1
0
, must be separately
equated to 0, whence we have
1 - y = (1 - x)z + v(1 - x)(1 - z),
x(1 - z) = 0;
whereof the first equation gives by interpretation the Proposition: Beasts which
do not divide the hoof consist of all unclean beasts which chew the cud, and an
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 70
indefinite remainder (some, none, or all) of unclean beasts which do not chew
the cud.
The second equation gives the Proposition: There are no clean beasts which
do not chew the cud. This is one of the independent relations above referred to.
We sought the direct relation of “Beasts not dividing the hoof,” to “Clean beasts
and beasts which chew the cud.” It happens, however, that independently of
any relation to beasts not dividing the hoof, there exists, in virtue of the premiss,
a separate relation between clean beasts and beasts which chew the cud. This
relation is also necessarily given by the process.
Ex. 3.–Let us take the following definition, viz.: “Responsible beings are all
rational beings who are either free to act, or have voluntarily sacrificed their
freedom,” and apply to it the preceding analysis.
Let x stand for responsible beings.
y ” rational beings.
z ” those who are free to act,
w ” those who have voluntarily sacrificed their
freedom of action.
In the expression of this definition I shall assume, that the two alternatives
which it presents, viz.: “Rational beings free to act,” and “Rational beings
whose freedom of action has been voluntarily sacrificed,” are mutually exclusive,
so that no individuals are found at once in both these divisions. This will permit
us to interpret the proposition literally into the language of symbols, as follows:
x = yz + yw. (6)
Let us first determine hence the relation of “rational beings” to responsible
beings, beings free to act, and beings whose freedom of action has been voluntarily
abjured. Perhaps this object will be better stated by saying, that we desire
to express the relation among the elements of the premiss in such a form as will
enable us to determine how far rationality may be inferred from responsibility,
freedom of action, a voluntary sacrifice of freedom, and their contraries.
From (6) we have
y =
x
(z + w)
,
and developing the second member, but rejecting terms whose coefficients
are 0,
y =
1
2
xzw + xz(1 - w) + x(1 - z)w +
1
0
x(1 - z)(1 - w)
+
0
0
(1 - x)(1 - z)(1 - w),
whence, equating to 0 the terms whose coefficients are 1
2
and 1
0
, we have
y = xz(1 - w) + xw(1 - z) + v(1 - x)(1 - z)(1 - w); (7)
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 71
xzw = 0; (8)
x(1 - z)(1 - w) = 0; (9)
whence by interpretation—
Direct Conclusion.—Rational beings are all responsible beings who are
either free to act, not having voluntarily sacrificed their freedom, or not free
to act, having voluntarily sacrificed their freedom, together with an indefinite
remainder (some, none, or all) of beings not responsible, not free, and not having
voluntarily sacrificed their freedom.
First Independent Relation.—No responsible beings are at the same
time free to act, and in the condition of having voluntarily sacrificed their freedom.
Second.–No responsible beings are not free to act, and at the same time in
the condition of not having sacrificed their freedom.
The independent relations above determined may, however, be put in another
and more convenient form. Thus (8) gives
xw =
0
z
= 0z +
0
0
(1 - z), on development;
or,
xw = v(1 - z); (10)
and in like manner (9) gives
x(1 - w) = 0
1 - z
=
0
0
z + 0(1 - z);
or,
x(1 - w) = vz; (11)
and (10) and (11) interpreted give the following Propositions:
1st. Responsible beings who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not
free.
2nd. Responsible beings who have not voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are
free.
These, however, are merely different forms of the relations before determined.
16. In examining, these results, the reader must bear in mind, that the sole
province of a method of inference or analysis, is to determine those relations
which are necessitated by the connexion of the terms in the original proposition.
Accordingly, in estimating the completeness with which this object is
effected, we have nothing whatever to do with those other relations which may
be suggested to our minds by the meaning of the terms employed, as distinct
from their expressed connexion. Thus it seems obvious to remark, that “They
who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not free,” this being a relation
implied in the very meaning of the terms. And hence it might appear, that
the first of the two independent relations assigned by the method is on the one
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 72
hand needlessly limited, and on the other hand superfluous. However, if regard
be had merely to the connexion of the terms in the original premiss, it will be
seen that the relation in question is not liable to either of these charges. The
solution, as expressed in the direct conclusion and the independent relations,
conjointly, is perfectly complete, without being in any way superfluous.
If we wish to take into account the implicit relation above referred to, viz.,
“They who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not free,” we can do so
by making this a distinct proposition, the proper expression of which would be
w = v(1 - z).
This equation we should have to employ together with that expressive of the
original premiss. The mode in which such an examination must be conducted
will appear when we enter upon the theory of systems of propositions in a future
chapter. The sole difference of result to which the analysis leads is, that the
first of the independent relations deduced above is superseded.
17. Ex. 4. – Assuming the same definition as in Example 2, let it be required
to obtain a description of irrational persons.
We have
1 - y = l -
x
z + w
=
z + w - x
z + w
=
1
2
xzw + 0xz(1 - w) + 0x(1 - z)w -
1
0
x(1 - z)(1 - w)
+ (1 - x)zw + (1 - x)z(1 - w) + (1 - x)(1 - z)w +
0
0
(1 - x)(1 - z)(1 - w)
= (1 - x)zw + (1 - x)z(1 - w) + (1 - x)(1 - z)w + v(1 - x)(1 - z)(1 - w)
= (1 - x)z + (1 - x)(1 - z)w + v(1 - x)(1 - z)(1 - w),
with xzw = 0, x(1 - z)(1 - w) = 0.
The independent relations here given are the same as we before arrived at,
as they evidently ought to be, since whatever relations prevail independently
of the existence of a given class of objects y, prevail independently also of the
existence of the contrary class 1 - y.
The direct solution afforded by the first equation is:–Irrational persons consist
of all irresponsible beings who are either free to act, or have voluntarily
sacrificed their liberty, and are not free to act; together with an indefinite remainder
of irresponsible beings who have not sacrificed their liberty, and are not
free to act.
18. The propositions analyzed in this chapter have been of that species
called definitions. I have discussed none of which the second or predicate term
is particular, and of which the general type is Y = vX, Y and X being functions
of the logical symbols x, y, z, &c., and v an indefinite class symbol. The analysis
CHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 73
of such propositions is greatly facilitated (though the step is not an essential one)
by the elimination of the symbol v, and this process depends upon the method
of the next chapter. I postpone also the consideration of another important
problem necessary to complete the theory of single propositions, but of which
the analysis really depends upon the method of the reduction of systems of
propositions to be developed in a future page of this work.
Chapter VII
ON ELIMINATION.
1. In the examples discussed in the last chapter, all the elements of the original
premiss re-appeared in the conclusion, only in a different order, and with a
different connexion. But it more usually happens in common reasoning, and
especially when we have more than one premiss, that some of the elements
are required not to appear in the conclusion. Such elements, or, as they are
commonly called, “middle terms,” may be considered as introduced into the
original propositions only for the sake of that connexion which they assist to
establish among the other elements, which are alone designed to enter into the
expression of the conclusion.
2. Respecting such intermediate elements, or middle terms, some erroneous
notions prevail. It is a general opinion, to which, however, the examples contained
in the last chapter furnish a contradiction, that inference consists peculiarly
in the elimination of such terms, and that the elementary type of this
process is exhibited in the elimination of one middle term from two premises, so
as to produce a single resulting conclusion into which that term does not enter.
Hence it is commonly held, that syllogism is the basis, or else the common type,
of all inference, which may thus, however complex its form and structure, be
resolved into a series of syllogisms. The propriety of this view will be considered
in a subsequent chapter. At present I wish to direct attention to an important,
but hitherto unnoticed, point of difference between the system of Logic, as expressed
by symbols, and that of common algebra, with reference to the subject
of elimination. In the algebraic system we are able to eliminate one symbol from
two equations, two symbols from three equations, and generally n - 1 symbols
from n equations. There thus exists a definite connexion between the number of
independent equations given, and the number of symbols of quantity which it is
possible to eliminate from them. But it is otherwise with the system of Logic.
No fixed connexion there prevails between the number of equations given representing
propositions or premises, and the number of typical symbols of which
the elimination can be effected. From a single equation an indefinite number of
such symbols may be eliminated. On the other hand, from an indefinite number
of equations, a single class symbol only may be eliminated. We may affirm,
that in this peculiar system, the problem of elimination is resolvable under all
74
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 75
circumstances alike. This is a consequence of that remarkable law of duality
to which the symbols of Logic are subject. To the equations furnished by the
premises given, there is added another equation or system of equations drawn
from the fundamental laws of thought itself, and supplying the necessary means
for the solution of the problem in question. Of the many consequences which
flow from the law of duality, this is perhaps the most deserving of attention.
3. As in Algebra it often happens, that the elimination of symbols from a
given system of equations conducts to a mere identity in the form 0 = 0, no
independent relations connecting the symbols which remain; so in the system
of Logic, a like result, admitting of a similar interpretation, may present itself.
Such a circumstance does not detract from the generality of the principle before
stated. The object of the method upon which we are about to enter is to
eliminate any number of symbols from any number of logical equations, and to
exhibit in the result the actual relations which remain. Now it may be, that no
such residual relations exist. In such a case the truth of the method is shown
by its leading us to a merely identical proposition.
4. The notation adopted in the following Propositions is similar to that of
the last chapter. By f(x) is meant any expression involving the logical symbol
x, with or without other logical symbols. By f(1) is meant what f(x) becomes
when x is therein changed into 1; by f(0) what the same function becomes when
x is changed into 0.
Proposition I.
5. If f(x) = 0 be any logical equation involving the class symbol x, with or
without other class symbols, then will the equation
f(1)f(0) = 0
be true, independently of the interpretation of x; and it will be the complete
result of the elimination of x from the above equation.
In other words, the elimination of x from any given equation, f(x) = 0, will
be effected by successively changing in that equation x into 1, and x into 0, and
multiplying the two resulting equations together.
Similarly the complete result of the elimination of any class symbols, x,
y, etc.,from any equation of the form V = 0, will be obtained by completely
expanding the first member of that equation in constituents of the given symbols,
and multiplying together all the coefficients of those constituents, and equating
the product to 0.
Developing the first member of the equation f(x) = 0, we have (V. 10),
f(1)x + f(0)(1 - x) = 0;
or, [f(1) - f(0)]x + f(0) = 0. ? x =
f(0)
f(0) - f(1);
and 1 - x = -
f(1)
f(0) - f(1).
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 76
Substitute these expressions for x and 1 - x in the fundamental equation
x(1 - x) = 0,
and there results
-
f(0)f(1)
[f(0) - f(1)]2
= 0;
or, f(1)f(0) = 0, (1)
the form required.
6. It is seen in this process, that the elimination is really effected between
the given equation f(x) = 0 and the universally true equation x(1 - x) = 0,
expressing the fundamental law of logical symbols, qua logical. There exists,
therefore, no need of more than one premiss or equation, in order to render possible
the elimination of a term, the necessary law of thought virtually supplying
the other premiss or equation. And though the demonstration of this conclusion
may be exhibited in other forms, yet the same element furnished by the mind
itself will still be virtually present. Thus we might proceed as follows:
Multiply (1) by x, and we have
f(1)x = 0, (2)
and let us seek by the forms of ordinary algebra to eliminate x from this equation
and (1).
Now if we have two algebraic equations of the form
ax + b = 0,
a
0x + b
0 = 0;
it is well known that the result of the elimination of x is
ab0 - a
0
b = 0 (3)
But comparing the above pair of equations with (1) and (3) respectively, we
find
a = f(1) - f(0), b = f(0);
a
0 = f(1) b
0 = 0;
which, substituted in (4), give
f(1)f(0) = 0,
as before. In this form of the demonstration, the fundamental equation x(1 -
x) = 0, makes its appearance in the derivation of (3) from (1).
7. I shall add yet another form of the demonstration, partaking of a half logical
character, and which may set the demonstration of this important theorem
in a clearer light.
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 77
We have as before
f(1)x + f(0)(1 - x) = 0.
Multiply this equation first by x, and secondly by 1 - x, we get
f(1)x = 0 f(0)(1 - x) = 0.
From these we have by solution and development,
f(1) = 0
x
=
0
0
(1 - x), on development,
f(0) = 0
1 - x
=
0
0
x.
The direct interpretation of these equations is–
1st. Whatever individuals are included in the class represented by f(1), are
not x’s.
2nd. Whatever individuals are included in the class represented by f(0), are
x’s.
Whence by common logic, there are no individuals at once in the class f(1)
and in the class f(0), i.e. there are no individuals in the class f(1)f(0). Hence,
f(1)f(0) = 0. (4)
Or it would suffice to multiply together the developed equations, whence the
result would immediately follow.
8. The theorem (5) furnishes us with the following Rule :
TO ELIMINATE ANY SYMBOL FROM A PROPOSED EQUATION.
RULE.–The terms of the equation having been brought, by transposition if
necessary, to the first side, give to the symbol successively the values 1 and 0,
and multiply the resulting equations together.
The first part of the Proposition is now proved.
9. Consider in the next place the general equation
f(x, y) = 0;
the first member of which represents any function of x, y, and other symbols.
By what has been shown, the result of the elimination of y from this equation
will be
f(x, 1)f(x, 0) = 0;
for such is the form to which we are conducted by successively changing in the
given equation y into 1, and y into 0, and multiplying the results together.
Again, if in the result obtained we change successively x into 1, and x into
0, and multiply the results together, we have
f(1, 1)f(1, 0)f(0, 1)f(0, 0) = 0; (5)
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 78
as the final result of elimination. But the four factors of the first member of this
equation are the four coefficients of the complete expansion of f(x, y), the first
member of the original equation; whence the second part of the Proposition is
manifest.
examples.
10. Ex. 1. – Having given the Proposition, “All men are mortal,” and its
symbolical expression, in the equation,
y = vx,
in which y represents “men,” and x “mortals,” it is required to eliminate the
indefinite class symbol v, and to interpret the result.
Here bringing the terms to the first side, we have
y - vx = 0.
When v = 1 this becomes
y - x = 0;
and when v = 0 it becomes
y = 0;
and these two equations multiplied together, give
y - yx = 0,
or y(1 - x) = 0,
it being observed that y
2 = y.
The above equation is the required result of elimination, and its interpretation
is, Men who are not mortal do not exist, – an obvious conclusion.
If from the equation last obtained we seek a description of beings who are
not mortal, we have
x =
y
y
,
? 1 - x =
0
y
.
Whence, by expansion, 1 - x =
0
0
(1 - y), which interpreted gives, They who
are not mortal are not men. This is an example of what in the common logic is
called conversion by contraposition, or negative conversion. 1
Ex. 2.–Taking the Proposition, “No men are perfect,” as represented by the
equation
y = v(1 - x),
1Whately’s Logic, Book II. chap. II. sec. 4.
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 79
wherein y represents “men,” and x “perfect beings,” it is required to eliminate
v, and find from the result a description both of perfect beings and of imperfect
beings. We have
y - v(1 - x) = 0.
Whence, by the rule of elimination,
{y - (1 - x)} × y = 0,
or
y - y(1 - x) = 0,
or
yx = 0;
which is interpreted by the Proposition, Perfect men do not exist. From the
above equation we have
x =
0
y
=
0
0
(1 - y) by development;
whence, by interpretation, No perfect beings are men. Similarly,
1 - x = 1 -
0
y
=
y
y
= y +
0
0
(1 - y),
which, on interpretation, gives, Imperfect beings are all men with an indefinite
remainder of beings, which are not men.
11. It will generally be the most convenient course, in the treatment of
propositions, to eliminate first the indefinite class symbol v, wherever it occurs
in the corresponding equations. This will only modify their form, without impairing
their significance. Let us apply this process to one of the examples of
Chap. IV. For the Proposition, “No men are placed in exalted stations and free
from envious regards,” we found the expression
y = v(1 - xz),
and for the equivalent Proposition, “Men in exalted stations are not free from
envious regards,” the expression
yx = v(1 - z);
and it was observed that these equations, v being an indefinite class symbol,
were themselves equivalent. To prove this, it is only necessary to eliminate from
each the symbol v. The first equation is
y - v(1 - xz) = 0,
whence, first making v = 1, and then v = 0, and multiplying the results, we
have
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 80
(y - 1 + xz)y = 0,
or yxz = 0.
Now the second of the given equations becomes on transposition
yx - v(1 - z) - 0;
whence (x - 1 + z)yx = 0,
or yxz = 0,
as before. The reader will easily interpret the result.
12. Ex. 3.–As a subject for the general method of this chapter, we will
resume Mr. Senior’s definition of wealth, viz.: “Wealth consists of things transferable,
limited in supply, and either productive of pleasure or preventive of
pain.” We shall consider this definition, agreeably to a former remark, as including
all things which possess at once both the qualities expressed in the last
part of the definition, upon which assumption we have, as our representative
equation,
w = st{pr + p(1 - r) + r(1 - p)},
or w = st{p + r(1 - p)},
wherein
w stands for wealth.
s ” things limited in supply.
t ” things transferable.
p ” things productive of pleasure.
r ” things preventive of pain.
From the above equation we can eliminate any symbols that we do not
desire to take into account, and express the result by solution and development,
according to any proposed arrangement of subject and predicate.
Let us first consider what the expression for w, wealth, would be if the
element r, referring to prevention of pain, were eliminated. Now bringing the
terms of the equation to the first side, we get
w - st(p + r - rp) = 0.
Making r = 1, the first member becomes w-st, and making r = 0 it becomes
w - stp; whence we have by the Rule,
(w - st)(w - stp) = 0 (6)
or
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 81
w - wstp - wst + stp = 0; (7)
whence
w =
stp
st + stp - 1
;
the development of the second member of which equation gives
w = stp +
0
0
st(1 - p). (8)
Whence we have the conclusion,–Wealth consists of all things limited in supply,
transferable, and productive of pleasure, and an indefinite remainder of
things limited in supply, transferable, and not productive of pleasure. This is
sufficiently obvious.
Let it be remarked that it is not necessary to perform the multiplication
indicated in (7), and reduce that equation to the form (8), in order to determine
the expression of w in terms of the other symbols. The process of development
may in all cases be made to supersede that of multiplication. Thus if we develop
(7) in terms of w, we find
(1 - sf)(1 - stp)w + stp(1 - w) = 0,
whence
w =
stp
stp - (1 - st)(1 - stp)
;
and this equation developed will give, as before,
w = stp +
0
0
st(1 - p).
13. Suppose next that we seek a description of things limited in supply,
as dependent upon their relation to wealth, transferableness, and tendency to
produce pleasure, omitting all reference to the prevention of pain.
From equation (8), which is the result of the elimination of r from the original
equation, we have
w - s (wt + wtp - tp) = 0;
whence
s =
w
wt + wtp - tp
= wtp + wt(1 - p) + 1
0
w (1 - t) p +
1
0
w (1 - t) (1 - p)
+0 (1 - w)tp +
0
0
(1 - w)t(1 - p) + 0
0
(1 - w) (1 - t) p
+
0
0
(1 - w) (1 - t) (1 - p).
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 82
We will first give the direct interpretation of the above solution, term by term;
afterwards we shall offer some general remarks which it suggests; and, finally,
show how the expression of the conclusion may be somewhat abbreviated.
First, then, the direct interpretation is, Things limited in supply consist of
All wealth transferable and productive of pleasure–all wealth transferable, and not
productive of pleasure,–an indefinite amount of what is not wealth, but is either
transferable, and not productive of pleasure, or intransferable and productive of
pleasure, or neither transferable nor productive of pleasure.
To which the terms whose coefficients are 1
0
permit us to add the following
independent relations, viz.:
1st. Wealth that is intransferable, and productive of pleasure, does not exist.
2ndly. Wealth that is intransferable, and not productive of pleasure, does not
exist.
14. Respecting this solution I suppose the following remarks are likely to be
made.
First, it may be said, that in the expression above obtained for “things
limited in supply,” the term “All wealth transferable,” &c., is in part redundant;
since all wealth is (as implied in the original proposition, and directly asserted
in the independent relations) necessarily transferable.
I answer, that although in ordinary speech we should not deem it necessary to
add to “wealth” the epithet “transferable,” if another part of our reasoning had
led us to express the conclusion, that there is no wealth which is not transferable,
yet it pertains to the perfection of this method that it in all cases fully defines the
objects represented by each term of the conclusion, by stating the relation they
bear to each quality or element of distinction that we have chosen to employ.
This is necessary in order to keep the different parts of the solution really distinct
and independent, and actually prevents redundancy. Suppose that the pair of
terms we have been considering had not contained the word “transferable,”
and had unitedly been “All wealth,” we could then logically resolve the single
term “All wealth” into the two terms “All wealth transferable,” and “All wealth
intransferable.” But the latter term is shown to disappear by the “independent
relations.” Hence it forms no part of the description required, and is therefore
redundant. The remaining term agrees with the conclusion actually obtained.
Solutions in which there cannot, by logical divisions, be produced any superfluous
or redundant terms, may be termed pure solutions. Such are all the solutions
obtained by the method of development and elimination above explained.
It is proper to notice, that if the common algebraic method of elimination were
adopted in the cases in which that method is possible in the present system,
we should not be able to depend upon the purity of the solutions obtained. Its
want of generality would not be its only defect.
15. In the second place, it will be remarked, that the conclusion contains
two terms, the aggregate significance of which would be more conveniently expressed
by a single term. Instead of “All wealth productive of pleasure, and
transferable,” and “All wealth not productive of pleasure, and transferable,” we
might simply say, “All wealth transferable.” This remark is quite just. But it
must be noticed that whenever any such simplifications are possible, they are
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 83
immediately suggested by the form of the equation we have to interpret; and if
that equation be reduced to its simplest form, then the interpretation to which
it conducts will be in its simplest form also. Thus in the original solution the
terms wtp and wt(1-p), which have unity for their coefficient, give, on addition,
wt; the terms w (1 - t) p and w (1 - t) (1 - p), which have 1
0
for their coefficient
give w (1 - t); and the terms (1 - w) (1 - t) p and (1 - w) (1 - t) (1 - p), which
have 0
0
for their coefficient, give (1 - w) (1 - t). Whence the complete solution
is
s = wt +
0
0
(1 - w) (1 - t) + 0
0
(1 - w)t(1 - p),
with the independent relation,
w (1 - t) = 0, or w =
0
0
t.
The interpretation would now stand thus:–
1st. Things limited in supply consist of all wealth transferable, with an indefinite
remainder of what is not wealth and not transferable, and of transferable
articles which are not wealth, and are not productive of pleasure.
2nd. All wealth is transferable.
This is the simplest form under which the general conclusion, with its attendant
condition, can be put.
16. When it is required to eliminate two or more symbols from a proposed
equation we can either employ (6) Prop. I., or eliminate them in succession, the
order of the process being indifferent. From the equation
w = st(p + r - pr),
we have eliminated r, and found the result,
w - wst - wstp + stp = 0.
Suppose that it had been required to eliminate both r and t, then taking the
above as the first step of the process, it remains to eliminate from the last
equation t. Now when t = 1 the first member of that equation becomes
w - ws - wsp + sp,
and when t = 0 the same member becomes w. Whence we have
w (w - ws - wsp + sp) = 0,
or
w - ws = 0,
for the required result of elimination.
If from the last result we determine w, we have
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 84
w =
0
1 - s
=
0
0
s,
whence “All wealth is limited in supply.” As p does not enter into the equation,
it is evident that the above is true, irrespectively of any relation which the
elements of the conclusion bear to the quality “productive of pleasure.”
Resuming the original equation, let it be required to eliminate s and t. We
have
w = st(p + r - pr).
Instead, however, of separately eliminating s and t according to the Rule, it
will suffice to treat st as a single symbol, seeing that it satisfies the fundamental
law of the symbols by the equation
st(1 - st) = 0.
Placing, therefore, the given equation under the form
w - st(p + r - pr) = 0;
and making st successively equal to 1 and to 0, and taking the product of
the results, we have
(w - p - r + pr)w = 0,
or w - wp - wr + wpr = 0,
for the result sought.
As a particular illustration, let it be required to deduce an expression for
“things productive of pleasure” (p), in terms of “wealth” (w), and “things preventive
of pain” (r).
We have, on solving the equation,
p =
w(1 - r)
w(1 - r)
=
0
0
wr + w(1 - r) + 0
0
(1 - w)r +
0
0
(1 - w)(1 - r)
= w(1 - r) + 0
0
wr +
0
0
(1 - w).
Whence the following conclusion:–Things productive of pleasure are, all
wealth not preventive of pain, an indefinite amount of wealth that is preventive
of pain, and an indefinite amount of what is not wealth.
From the same equation we get
1 - p = 1 -
w(1 - r)
w(1 - r)
=
0
w(1 - r)
,
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 85
which developed, gives
w(1 - p) = 0
0
wr +
0
0
(1 - w)·r +
0
0
(1 - w) · (1 - r)
=
0
0
wr +
0
0
(1 - w).
Whence, Things not productive of pleasure are either wealth, preventive of
pain, or what is not wealth.
Equally easy would be the discussion of any similar case.
17. In the last example of elimination, we have eliminated the compound
symbol st from the given equation, by treating it as a single symbol. The
same method is applicable to any combination of symbols which satisfies the
fundamental law of individual symbols. Thus the expression p + r - pr will, on
being multiplied by itself, reproduce itself, so that if we represent p + r - pr by
a single symbol as y, we shall have the fundamental law obeyed, the equation
y = y
2
, or y(1 - y) = 0,
being satisfied. For the rule of elimination for symbols is founded upon the
supposition that each individual symbol is subject to that law; and hence the
elimination of any function or combination of such symbols from an equation,
may be effected by a single operation, whenever that law is satisfied by the
function.
Though the forms of interpretation adopted in this and the previous chapter
show, perhaps better than any others, the direct significance of the symbols 1
and 0
0
, modes of expression more agreeable to those of common discourse may,
with equal truth and propriety, be employed. Thus the equation (9) may be
interpreted in the following manner: Wealth is either limited in supply, transferable,
and productive of pleasure, or limited in supply, transferable, and not
productive of pleasure. And reversely, Whatever is limited in supply, transferable,
and productive of pleasure, is wealth. Reverse interpretations, similar to
the above, are always furnished when the final development introduces terms
having unity as a coefficient.
18. NOTE.–The fundamental equation f(1)f(0) = 0, expressing the result
of the elimination of the symbol x from any equation f(x) = 0, admits of a
remarkable interpretation.
It is to be remembered, that by the equation f(x) = 0 is implied some
proposition in which the individuals represented by the class x, suppose “men,”
are referred to, together, it may be, with other individuals; and it is our object
to ascertain whether there is implied in the proposition any relation among
the other individuals, independently of those found in the class men. Now
the equation f(1) = 0 expresses what the original proposition would become
if men made up the universe, and the equation f(0) = 0 expresses what that
original proposition would become if men ceased to exist, wherefore the equation
f(1)f(0) = 0 expresses what in virtue of the original proposition would be
CHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 86
equally true on either assumption, i. e. equally true whether “men” were “all
things” or “nothing.” Wherefore the theorem expresses that what is equally
true, whether a given class of objects embraces the whole universe or disappears
from existence, is independent of that class altogether, and vice versˆa. Herein we
see another example of the interpretation of formal results, immediately deduced
from the mathematical laws of thought, into general axioms of philosophy.
Chapter VIII
ON THE REDUCTION OF SYSTEMS OF
PROPOSITIONS.
1. In the preceding chapters we have determined sufficiently for the most essential
purposes the theory of single primary propositions, or, to speak more
accurately, of primary propositions expressed by a single equation. And we
have established upon that theory an adequate method. We have shown how
any element involved in the given system of equations may be eliminated, and
the relation which connects the remaining elements deduced in any proposed
form, whether of denial, of affirmation, or of the more usual relation of subject
and predicate. It remains that we proceed to the consideration of systems of
propositions, and institute with respect to them a similar series of investigations.
We are to inquire whether it is possible from the equations by which
a system of propositions is expressed to eliminate, ad libitum, any number of
the symbols involved; to deduce by interpretation of the result the whole of the
relations implied among the remaining symbols; and to determine in particular
the expression of any single element, or of any interpretable combination
of elements, in terms of the other elements, so as to present the conclusion in
any admissible form that may be required. These questions will be answered
by showing that it is possible to reduce any system of equations, or any of the
equations involved in a system, to an equivalent single equation, to which the
methods of the previous chapters may be immediately applied. It will be seen
also, that in this reduction is involved an important extension of the theory
of single propositions, which in the previous discussion of the subject we were
compelled to forego. This circumstance is not peculiar in its nature. There are
many special departments of science which cannot be completely surveyed from
within, but require to be studied also from an external point of view, and to be
regarded in connexion with other and kindred subjects, in order that their full
proportions be understood.
This chapter will exhibit two distinct modes of reducing systems of equations
to equivalent single equations. The first of these rests upon the employment of
arbitrary constant multipliers. It is a method sufficiently simple in theory, but it
has the inconvenience of rendering the subsequent processes of elimination and
development, when they occur, somewhat tedious. It was, however, the method
87
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 88
of reduction first discovered, and partly on this account, and partly on account
of its simplicity, it has been thought proper to retain it. The second method
does not require the introduction of arbitrary constants, and is in nearly all
respects preferable to the preceding one. It will, therefore, generally be adopted
in the subsequent investigations of this work.
2. We proceed to the consideration of the first method.
Proposition I.
Any system of logical equations may be reduced to a single equivalent equation,
by multiplying each equation after the first by a distinct arbitrary constant
quantity, and adding all the results, including the first equation, together.
By Prop. 2, Chap, VI., the interpretation of any single equation, f(x, y..) = 0
is obtained by equating to 0 those constituents of the development of the first
member, whose coefficients do not vanish. And hence, if there be given two
equations, f(x, y..) = 0, and F(x, y..) = 0, their united import will be contained
in the system of results formed by equating to 0 all those constituents which
thus present themselves in both, or in either, of the given equations developed
according to the Rule of Chap. VI. Thus let it be supposed, that we have the
two equations
xy - 2x = 0, (1)
x - y = 0; (2)
The development of the first gives
-xy - 2x(1 - y) = 0;
whence, xy = 0, x(1 - y) = 0. (3)
The development of the second equation gives
x(1 - y) - y(1 - x) = 0;
whence, x(1 - y) = 0, y(1 - x) = 0. (4)
The constituents whose coefficients do not vanish in both developments are xy,
x(1 - y), and (1 - x)y, and these would together give the system
xy = 0, x(1 - y) = 0,(l - x)y = 0; (5)
which is equivalent to the two systems given by the developments separately,
seeing that in those systems the equation x(1 - y) = 0 is repeated. Confining
ourselves to the case of binary systems of equations, it remains then to determine
a single equation, which on development shall yield the same constituents with
coefficients which do not vanish, as the given equations produce. Now if we
represent by
V1 = 0, V2 = 0,
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 89
the given equations, V1 and V2 being functions of the logical symbols x, y, z,
&c.; then the single equation
V1 + cV2 = 0, (6)
c being an arbitrary constant quantity, will accomplish the required object. For
let At represent any term in the full development V , wherein t is a constituent
and A its numerical coefficient, and let Bt represent the corresponding term in
the full development of V2, then will the corresponding term in the development
of (6) be
(A + cB)t.
The coefficient of t vanishes if A and B both vanish, but not otherwise. For if
we assume that A and B do not both vanish, and at the same time make
A + cB = 0, (7)
the following cases alone can present themselves.
1st. That A vanishes and B does not vanish. In this case the above equation
becomes
cB = 0,
and requires that c = 0. But this contradicts the hypothesis that c is an
arbitrary constant.
2nd. That B vanishes and A does not vanish. This assumption reduces (7)
to
A = 0,
by which the assumption is itself violated.
3rd. That neither A nor B vanishes. The equation (7) then gives
c =
-A
B
which is a definite value, and, therefore, conflicts with the hypothesis that c is
arbitrary.
Hence the coefficient A + cB vanishes when A and B both vanish, but not
otherwise. Therefore, the same constituents will appear in the development of
(6), with coefficients which do not vanish, as in the equations V1 = 0, V2 = 0,
singly or together. And the equation V1 + cV2 = 0, will be equivalent to the
system V1 = 0, V2 = 0.
By similar reasoning it appears, that the general system of equations
V1 = 0, V2 = 0, V3 = 0, &c. ;
may be replaced by the single equation
V1 + cV2 + c
0V3 + &c. = 0 ,
c, c0
, &c., being arbitrary constants. The equation thus formed may be treated
in all respects as the ordinary logical equations of the previous chapters. The
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 90
arbitrary constants c1, c2, &c., are not logical symbols. They do not satisfy the
law,
c1(1 - c1) = 0, c2(1 - c2) = 0 .
But their introduction is justified by that general principle which has been stated
in (II. 15) and (V. 6), and exemplified in nearly all our subsequent investigations,
viz., that equations involving the symbols of Logic may be treated in all respects
as if those symbols were symbols of quantity, subject to the special law x(1-x) =
0, until in the final stage of solution they assume a form interpretable in that
system of thought with which Logic is conversant.
3. The following example will serve to illustrate the above method.
Ex. 1.–Suppose that an analysis of the properties of a particular class of
substances has led to the following general conclusions, viz.:
1st. That wherever the properties A and B are combined, either the property
C, or the property D, is present also; but they are not jointly present.
2nd. That wherever the properties B and C are combined, the properties A
and D are either both present with them, or both absent.
3rd. That wherever the properties A and B are both absent, the properties
C and D are both absent also; and vice versa, where the properties C and D
are both absent, A and B are both absent also.
Let it then be required from the above to determine what may be concluded
in any particular instance from the presence of the property A with respect to
the presence or absence of the properties B and C, paying no regard to the
property D.
Represent the property A by x;
” the property B by y;
” the property C by z;
” the property D by w.
Then the symbolical expression of the premises will be
xy-v(w(1-z)+z(1-w)); yz = v(xw+(1-x)(1-w)); (1-x)(1-y) = (1-z)(1-w).
From the first two of these equations, separately eliminating the indefinite
class symbol v, we have
xy(1 - w(1 - z) - z(1 - w)) = 0;
yz(1 - xw - (1 - x)(1 - w)) = 0.
Now if we observe that by development
1 - w(1 - z) - z(1 - w) = wz + (1 - w)(1 - z),
and
1 - xw - (1 - x)(1 - w) = x(1 - w) + w(1 - x),
and in these expressions replace, for simplicity,
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 91
1 - xbyx, ¯ 1 - ybyy, ¯ &c.,
we shall have from the three last equations,
xy(wz + ¯wz¯) = 0; (1)
yz(xw¯ + ¯xw) = 0; (2)
x¯y¯ = ¯wz¯; (3)
and from this system we must eliminate w.
Multiplying the second of the above equations by c, and the third by c
0
, and
adding the results to the first, we have
xy(wz + ¯wz¯) + cyz(xw¯ + ¯xw) + c
0
(¯xy¯ - w¯z¯) = 0.
When w is made equal to 1, and therefore ¯w to 0, the first member of the
above equation becomes
xyz + cxyz ¯ + c
0x¯y. ¯
And when in the same member w is made 0 and ¯w = 1, it becomes
xyz¯ + cxyz + c
0x¯y¯ - c
0
z. ¯
Hence the result of the elimination of w may be expressed in the form
(xyz + cxyz ¯ + c
0x¯y¯)(xyz¯ + cxyz + c
0x¯y¯ - c
0
z¯) = 0; (4)
and from this equation x is to be determined.
Were we now to proceed as in former instances, we should multiply together
the factors in the first member of the above equation ; but it may be well to
show that such a course is not at all necessary. Let us develop the first member
of (4) with reference to x, the symbol whose expression is sought, we find
yz(yz¯ + cyz - c
0
z¯)x + (cyz + c
0
y¯)(c
0
y¯ - c
0
z)(1 - x) = 0;
or, cyzx + (cyz + c
0
y¯)(c
0
y¯ - c
0
z¯)(1 - x) = 0;
whence we find,
x =
(cyz + c
0y¯)(c
0y¯ - c
0
z¯)
(cyz + c
0y¯)(c
0y¯ - c
0z¯) - cyz
;
and developing the second member with respect to y and z,
x = 0yz +
0
0
yz¯ +
c
02
c
02
yz¯ +
0
0
y¯z¯;
or,
x = (1 - y) z +
0
0
y (1 - z) + 0
0
(1 - y) (1 - z) ;
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 92
or,
x = (1 - y) z +
0
0
(1 - z) ;
the interpretation of which is, Wherever the property A is present, there either
C is present and B absent, or C is absent. And inversely, Wherever the property
C is present, and the property B absent, there the property A is present.
These results may be much more readily obtained by the method next to
be explained. It is, however, satisfactory to possess different modes, serving for
mutual verification, of arriving at the same conclusion.
4. We proceed to the second method.
Proposition II.
If any equations, V1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c., are such that the developments of
their first members consist only of constituents with positive coefficients, those
equations may be combined together into a single equivalent equation by addition.
For, as before, let At represent any term in the development of the function
V1, Bt the corresponding term in the development of V2 and so on. Then will
the corresponding term in the development of the equation
V1 + V2 + &c. = 0, (1)
formed by the addition of the several given equations, be
(A + B + &c.)t.
But as by hypothesis the coefficients A, B, &c. are none of them negative,
the aggregate coefficient A + B, &c. in the derived equation will only vanish
when the separate coefficients A, B, &c. vanish together. Hence the same
constituents will appear in the development of the equation (1) as in the several
equations V1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c. of the original system taken collectively, and
therefore the interpretation of the equation (1) will be equivalent to the collective
interpretations of the several equations from which it is derived.
Proposition III.
5. If V1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c. represent any system of equations, the terms of
which have by transposition been brought to like first side, then the combined
interpretation of the system will be involved in the single equation,
V
2
1 + V
2
2 + &c. = 0,
formed by adding together the squares of the given equations.
For let any equation of the system, as V1 = 0, produce on development an
equation
a1t1 + a2t2 + &c. = 0
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 93
in which t1, t2, &c. are constituents, and a1, a2, &c. their corresponding coefficients.
Then the equation V
2
1 = 0 will produce on development an equation
a
2
1
t1 + a
2
2
t2 + &c. = 0,
as may be proved either from the law of the development or by squaring the
function a1t1 + a2t2, &c. in subjection to the conditions
t
2
1 = t1, t
2
2 = t2, , t1t2 = 0
assigned in Prop. 3, Chap. v. Hence the constituents which appear in
the expansion of the equation V
2
1 = 0, are the same with those which appear
in the expansion of the equation V1 = 0, and they have positive coefficients.
And the same remark applies to the equations V2 = 0, &c. Whence, by the last
Proposition, the equation
V
2
1 + V
2
2 + &c. = 0
will be equivalent in interpretation to the system of equations
V1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c.
Corollary.–Any equation, V = 0, of which the first member already satisfies
the condition
V
2 = V , or V (1 - V ) = 0,
does not need (as it would remain unaffected by) the process of squaring.
Such equations are, indeed, immediately developable into a series of constituents,
with coefficients equal to 1, Chap. v. Prop. 4.
Proposition IV.
6. Whenever the equations of a system have by the above process of squaring,
or by any other process, been reduced to a form such that all the constituents
exhibited in their development have positive coefficients, any derived equations
obtained by elimination will possess the same character, and may be combined
with the other equations by addition.
Suppose that we have to eliminate a symbol x from any equation V = 0,
which is such that none of the constituents, in the full development of its first
member, have negative coefficients. That expansion may be written in the form
V1x + V0(1 - x) = 0
V1 and V0 being each of the form
a1t1 + a2t2... + antn,
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 94
in which t1t2...tn are constituents of the other symbols, and a1a2...an in each
case positive or vanishing quantities. The result of elimination is
V1V2 = 0;
and as the coefficients in V1 and V2, are none of them negative, there can be no
negative coefficients in the product V1V2. Hence the equation V1V2 = 0 may be
added to any other equation, the coefficients of whose constituents are positive,
and the resulting equation will combine the full significance of those from which
it was obtained.
Proposition V.
7. To deduce from the previous Propositions a practical rule or method for
the reduction of systems of equations expressing propositions in Logic.
We have by the previous investigations established the following points, viz.:
1st. That any equations which are of the form V = 0, V satisfying the
fundamental law of duality V (1 - V ) = 0, may be combined together by simple
addition.
2ndly. That any other equations of the form V = 0 may be reduced, by the
process of squaring, to a form in which the same principle of combination by
mere addition is applicable.
It remains then only to determine what equations in the actual expression
of propositions belong to the former, and what to the latter, class.
Now the general types of propositions have been set forth in the conclusion
of Chap. IV. The division of propositions which they represent is as follows:
1st. Propositions, of which the subject is universal, and the predicate particular.
The symbolical type (IV. 15) is
X = vY,
X and Y satisfying the law of duality. Eliminating v, we have
X(1 - Y ) = 0, (1)
and this will be found also to satisfy the same law. No further reduction by
the process of squaring is needed.
2nd. Propositions of which both terms are universal, and of which the symbolical
type is
X = Y,
X and Y separately satisfying the law of duality. Writing the equation in
the form X - Y = 0, and squaring, we have
X - 2XY + Y = 0,
or, X(1 - Y ) + Y (1 - X) = 0. (2)
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 95
The first member of this equation satisfies the law of duality, as is evident
from its very form.
We may arrive at the same equation in a different manner. The equation
X = Y
is equivalent to the two equations
X = vY , Y = vX,
(for to affirm that X’s are identical with Y ’s is to affirm both that All X’s
are Y ’s, and that All Y ’s are X’s). Now these equations give, on elimination of
v,
X(1 - Y ) = 0, Y (1 - X) = 0,
which added, produce (2).
3rd. Propositions of which both terms are particular. The form of such
propositions is
vX = vY,
but v is not quite arbitrary, and therefore must not be eliminated. For v is the
representative of some, which, though it may include in its meaning all, does
not include none. We must therefore transpose the second member to the first
side, and square the resulting equation according to the rule. The result will
obviously be
vX(1 - Y ) + vY (l - X) = 0.
The above conclusions it may be convenient to embody in a Rule, which will
serve for constant future direction.
8. Rule.— The equations being so expressed as that the terms X and Y in
the following typical forms obey the law of duality, change the equations
X = vY into X(1 - Y ) = 0,
X = Y into X(1 - Y ) + Y (1 - X) = 0.
vX = vY into vX(1 - Y ) + vY (1 - X) = 0.
Any equation which is given in the form X = 0 will not need transformation,
and any equation which presents itself in the form X = 1 may be replaced by
1 - X = 0, as appears from the second of the above transformations.
When the equations of the system have thus been reduced, any of them, as
well as any equations derived from them by the process of elimination, may be
combined by addition.
9. Note.–It has been seen in Chapter IV. that in literally translating the
terms of a proposition, without attending to its real meaning, into the language
of symbols, we may produce equations in which the terms X and Y do not
obey the law of duality. The equation w = st(p + r), given in (3) Prop. 3 of the
chapter referred to, is of this kind. Such equations, however, as it has been seen,
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 96
have a meaning. Should it, for curiosity, or for any other motive, be determined
to employ them, it will be best to reduce them by the Rule (VI. 5).
10. Ex. 2.–Let us take the following Propositions of Elementary Geometry:
1st. Similar figures consist of all whose corresponding angles are equal, and
whose corresponding sides are proportional.
2nd. Triangles whose corresponding angles are equal have their corresponding
sides proportional, and vice versˆa.
To represent these premises, let us make
s = similar.
t = triangles.
q = having corresponding angles equal.
r = having corresponding sides proportional.
Then the premises are expressed by the following equations:
s = qr, (1)
tq = tr. (2)
Reducing by the Rule, or, which amounts to the same thing, bringing the terms
of these equations to the first side, squaring each equation, and then adding, we
have
s + qr - 2qrs + tq + tr - 2tqr = 0. (3)
Let it be required to deduce a description of dissimilar figures formed out of the
elements expressed by the terms, triangles, having corresponding angles equal,
having corresponding sides proportional.
We have from (3),
s =
tq + qr + rt - 2tqr
2qr - 1
,
? 1 - s =
qr - tq - rt + 2tqr - 1
2qr - 1
. (4)
And fully developing the second member, we find
1 - s = 0tqr + 2tq(1 - r) + 2tr(1 - q) + t(1 - q)(1 - r)
+0(1 - t)qr + (1 - t)q(1 - r) + (1 - t)r(1 - q)
+(1 - t)(1 - q)(1 - r). (5)
In the above development two of the terms have the coefficient 2, these must
be equated to 0 by the Rule, then those terms whose coefficients are 0 being
rejected, we have
1 - s = t(1 - q)(1 - r) + (1 - t)q(1 - r) + (1 - t)r(1 - q)
+(1 - t)(1 - q)(1 - r); (6)
tq(1 - r) = 0; (7)
tr(1 - q) = 0; (8)
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 97
the direct interpretation of which is
1st. Dissimilar figures consist of all triangles which have not their corresponding
angles equal and sides proportional, and of all figures not being triangles
which have either their angles equal, and sides not proportional, or their
corresponding sides proportional, and angles not equal, or neither their corresponding
angles equal nor corresponding sides proportional.
2nd. There are no triangles whose corresponding angles are equal. and sides
not proportional.
3rd. There are no triangles whose corresponding sides are proportional and
angles not equal.
11. Such are the immediate interpretations of the final equation. It is seen, in
accordance with the general theory, that in deducing a description of a particular
class of objects, viz., dissimilar figures, in terms of certain other elements of the
original premises, we obtain also the independent relations which exist among
those elements in virtue of the same premises. And that this is not superfluous
information, even as respects the immediate object of inquiry, may easily be
shown. For example, the independent relations may always be made use of
to reduce, if it be thought desirable, to a briefer form, the expression of that
relation which is directly sought. Thus if we write (7) in the form
0 = tq(l - r),
and add it to (6), we get, since
t(1 - q)(1 - r) + tq(1 - r) = t(1 - r),
1 - s = t(1 - r) + (1 - t)q(1 - r) + (1 - t)r(1 - q)
+(1 - t)(1 - q)(1 - r),
which, on interpretation, would give for the first term of the description of
dissimilar figures, “Triangles whose corresponding sides are not proportional,”
instead of the fuller description originally obtained. A regard to convenience
must always determine the propriety of such reduction.
12. A reduction which is always advantageous (VII. 15) consists in collecting
the terms of the immediate description sought, as of the second member of (5)
or (6), into as few groups as possible. Thus the third and fourth terms of the
second member of (6) produce by addition the single term (1 - t)(1 - q). If this
reduction be combined with the last, we have
1 - s = t(1 - r) + (1 - t)q(1 - r) + (1 - t)(1 - q),
the interpretation of which is
Dissimilar figures consist of all triangles whose corresponding sides are not
proportional, and all figures not being triangles which have either their corresponding
angles unequal, or their corresponding angles equal, but sides not
proportional.
The fulness of the general solution is therefore not a superfluity. While it
gives us all the information that we seek, it provides us also with the means of
expressing that information in the mode that is most advantageous.
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 98
13. Another observation, illustrative of a principle which has already been
stated, remains to be made. Two of the terms in the full development of 1-s in
(5) have 2 for their coefficients, instead of 1
0
. It will hereafter be shown that this
circumstance indicates that the two premises were not independent. To verify
this, let us resume the equations of the premises in their reduced forms, viz.,
s(1 - qr) + qr(1 - s) = 0,
tq(1 - r) + tr(1 - q) = 0.
Now if the first members of these equations have any common constituents, they
will appear on multiplying the equations together. If we do this we obtain
stq(1 - r) + str(l - q) = 0.
Whence there will result
stq(1 - r) = 0, str(1 - q) = 0,
these being equations which are deducible from either of the primitive ones.
Their interpretations are—
Similar triangles which have their corresponding angles equal have their corresponding
sides proportional.
Similar triangles which have their corresponding sides proportional have their
corresponding angles equal.
And these conclusions are equally deducible from either premiss singly. In
this respect, according to the definitions laid down, the premises are not independent.
14. Let us, in conclusion, resume the problem discussed in illustration of the
first method of this chapter, and endeavour to ascertain, by the present method,
what may be concluded from the presence of the property C, with reference to
the properties A and B.
We found on eliminating the symbols v the following equations, viz.:
xy(wz + ¯wz¯) = 0, (1)
yz(xw¯ + ¯xw) = 0, (2)
x¯y¯ = ¯wz. ¯ (3)
From these we are to eliminate w and determine z. Now (1) and (2) already
satisfy the condition V (l - V ) = 0. The third equation gives, on bringing the
terms to the first side, and squaring
x¯y¯(1 - w¯z¯) + ¯wz¯(1 - x¯y¯) = 0. (4)
Adding (1) (2) and (4) together, we have
xy(wz + ¯wz¯) + yz(xw¯ + ¯xw) + ¯xy¯(1 - w¯z¯) + ¯wz¯(l - x¯y¯) = 0.
CHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 99
Eliminating w, we get
(xyz + yzx¯ + ¯xy¯){xyz¯ + yzx + ¯xyz¯ + ¯z(l - x¯y¯)} = 0.
Now, on multiplying the terms in the second factor by those in the first successively,
observing that
xx¯ = 0, yy¯ = 0, zz¯ = 0,
nearly all disappear, and we have only left
xyz + ¯xyz¯ = 0; (5)
whence
z =
0
xy + ¯xy¯
= 0xy +
0
0
xy¯ +
0
0
xy¯ + 0¯xy¯
=
0
0
xy¯ +
0
0
xy, ¯
furnishing the interpretation. Wherever the property C is found, either the
property A or the property B will be found with it, but not both of them together.
From the equation (5) we may readily deduce the result arrived at in the
previous investigation by the method of arbitrary constant multipliers, as well
as any other proposed forms of the relation between x, y, and z; e. g. If the
property B is absent, either A and C will be jointly present, or C will be absent.
And conversely, If A and C are jointly present, B will be absent. The converse
part of this conclusion is founded on the presence of a term xz with unity for
its coefficient in the developed value of ¯y.
Chapter IX
ON CERTAIN METHODS OF ABBREVIATION.
1. Though the three fundamental methods of development, elimination, and
reduction, established and illustrated in the previous chapters, are sufficient for
all the practical ends of Logic, yet there are certain cases in which they admit,
and especially the method of elimination, of being simplified in an important
degree; and to these I wish to direct attention in the present chapter. I shall
first demonstrate some propositions in which the principles of the above methods
of abbreviation are contained, and I shall afterwards apply them to particular
examples.
Let us designate as class terms any terms which satisfy the fundamental law
V (1-V ) = 0. Such terms will individually be constituents; but, when occurring
together, will not, as do the terms of a development, necessarily involve the
same symbols in each. Thus ax + bxy + cyz may be described as an expression
consisting of three class terms, x, xy, and yz, multiplied by the coefficients a,
b, c respectively. The principle applied in the two following Propositions, and
which, in some instances, greatly abbreviates the process of elimination, is that
of the rejection of superfluous class terms; those being regarded as superfluous
which do not add to the constituents of the final result.
Proposition I.
2. From any equation, V = 0, in which V consists of a series of class terms
having positive coefficients, we are permitted to reject any term which contains
another term as a factor, and to change every positive coefficient to unity.
For the significance of this series of positive terms depends only upon the
number and nature of the constituents of its final expansion, i.e. of its expansion
with reference to all the symbols which it involves, and not at all upon the actual
values of the coefficients (VI. 5). Now let x be any term of the series, and xy
any other term having x as a factor. The expansion of x with reference to the
symbols x and y will be
xy + x (1 - y),
and the expansion of the sum of the terms x and xy will be
2xy + x (1 - y).
100
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 101
But by what has been said, these expressions occurring in the first member
of an equation, of which the second member is 0, and of which all the coefficients
of the first member are positive, are equivalent; since there must exist simply
the two constituents xy and x (1 - y) in the final expansion, whence will simply
arise the resulting equations
xy = 0, x (1 - y) = 0.
And, therefore, the aggregate of terms x + xy may be replaced by the single
term x.
The same reasoning applies to all the cases contemplated in the Proposition.
Thus, if the term x is repeated, the aggregate 2x may be replaced by x, because
under the circumstances the equation x = 0 must appear in the final reduction.
Proposition II.
3. Whenever in the process of elimination we have to multiply together two
factors, each consisting solely of positive terms, satisfying the fundamental law
of logical symbols, it is permitted to reject from both factors any common term,
or from either factor any term which is divisible by a term in the other factor;
provided always, that the rejected term be added to the product of the resulting
factors.
In the enunciation of this Proposition, the word “divisible” is a term of
convenience, used in the algebraic sense, in which xy and x (1 - y) are said to
be divisible by x.
To render more clear the import of this Proposition, let it be supposed that
the factors to be multiplied together are x + y + z and x + yw + t. It is then
asserted, that from these two factors We may reject the term x, and that from
the second factor we may reject the term yw, provided that these terms be
transferred to the final product. Thus, the resulting factors being y + z and t,
if to their product yt + zt we add the terms x and yw, we have
x + yw + yt + zt,
as an expression equivalent to the product of the given factors x + y + z and
x + yw + t; equivalent namely in the process of elimination.
Let us consider, first, the case in which the two factors have a common term
x, and let us represent the factors by the expressions x+P, x+Q, supposing P
in the one case and Q in the other to be the sum of the positive terms additional
to x.
Now,
(x + P)(x + Q) = x + xP + xQ + P Q. (1)
But the process of elimination consists in multiplying certain factors together,
and equating the result to 0. Either then the second member of the above
equation is to be equated to 0, or it is a factor of some expression which is to
be equated to 0.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 102
If the former alternative be taken, then, by the last Proposition, we are
permitted to reject the terms xP and xQ, inasmuch as they are positive terms
having another term x as a factor. The resulting expression is
x + P Q,
which is what we should obtain by rejecting x from both factors, and adding it
to the product of the factors which remain.
Taking the second alternative, the only mode in which the second member
of (1) can affect the final result of elimination must depend upon the number
and nature of its constituents, both which elements are unaffected by the rejection
of the terms xP and xQ. For that development of x includes all possible
constituents of which x is a factor.
Consider finally the case in which one of the factors contains a term, as xy,
divisible by a term, x, in the other factor.
Let x + P and xy + Q be the factors. Now
(x + P)(xy + Q) = xy + xQ + xyP + P Q.
But by the reasoning of the last Proposition, the term xyP may be rejected as
containing another positive term xy as a factor, whence we have
xy + xQ + P Q
= xy + (x + P)Q.
But this expresses the rejection of the term xy from the second factor, and its
transference to the final product. Wherefore the Proposition is manifest.
Proposition III.
4. If t be any symbol which is retained in the final result of the elimination of
any other symbols from any system of equations, the result of such elimination
may be expressed in the form
Et + E (1 - t) = 0,
in which E is formed by making in the proposed system t = 1, and eliminating
the same other symbols; and E0
by making in the proposed system t = 0, and
eliminating the same other symbols.
For let f (t) = 0 represent the final result of elimination. Expanding this
equation, we have
f (1)t + f (0) (1 - t) = 0.
Now by whatever process we deduce the function f (t) from the proposed system
of equations, by the same process should we deduce f (1), if in those equations
t were changed into 1; and by the same process should we deduce f (0), if in the
same equations t were changed into 0. Whence the truth of the proposition is
manifest.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 103
5. Of the three propositions last proved, it may be remarked, that though
quite unessential to the strict development or application of the general theory,
they yet accomplish important ends of a practical nature. By Prop. 1 we can
simplify the results of addition; by Prop. 2 we can simplify those of multiplication;
and by Prop. 3 we can break up any tedious process of elimination into two
distinct processes, which will in general be of a much less complex character.
This method will be very frequently adopted, when the final object of inquiry is
the determination of the value of t, in terms of the other symbols which remain
after the elimination is performed.
6. Ex. 1.—Aristotle, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Book II. Cap. 3, having
determined that actions are virtuous, not as possessing in themselves a certain
character, but as implying a certain condition of mind in him who performs
them, viz., that he perform them knowingly, and with deliberate preference,
and for their own sakes, and upon fixed principles of conduct, proceeds in the
two following chapters to consider the question, whether virtue is to be referred
to the genus of Passions, or Faculties, or Habits, together with some other
connected points. He grounds his investigation upon the following premises,
from which, also, he deduces the general doctrine and definition of moral virtue,
of which the remainder of the treatise forms an exposition.
premises.
1. Virtue is either a passion (p????), or a faculty (d??aµ??), or a habit (????).
2. Passions are not things according to which we are praised or blamed, or
in which we exercise deliberate preference.
3. Faculties are not things according to which we are praised or blamed, and
which are accompanied by deliberate preference.
4. Virtue is something according to which we are praised or blamed, and
which is accompanied by deliberate preference.
5. Whatever art or science makes its work to be in a good state avoids extremes,
and keeps the mean in view relative to human nature (t? µ?s?? . . . p???
?µa? ˜ )
6. Virtue is more exact and excellent than any art or science. This is an
argument `a fortiori. If science and true art shun defect and extravagance alike,
much more does virtue pursue the undeviating line of moderation. If they cause
their work to be in a good state, much more reason have to we to say that
Virtue causeth her peculiar work to be “in a good state.” Let the final premiss
be thus interpreted. Let us also pretermit all reference to praise or blame, since
the mention of these in the premises accompanies only the mention of deliberate
preference, and this is an element which we purpose to retain. We may then
assume as our representative symbols–
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 104
v = virtue.
p = passions.
f = faculties.
h = habits.
d = things accompanied by deliberate preference.
g = things causing their work to be in a good state.
m = things keeping the mean in view relative to human nature.
Using, then, q as an indefinite class symbol, our premises will be expressed by
the following equations:
v = q {p (1 - f) (1 - h) + f (1 - p) (1 - h) + h (1 - p) (1 - f)} .
p = q (1 - d).
f = q (1 - d).
v = qd.
g = qm.
v = qg.
And separately eliminating from these the symbols q,
v{1 - p (1 - f) (1 - h) - f (1 - p) (1 - h) - h (1 - p) (1 - f)} = 0. (1)
pd = 0. (2)
f d = 0. (3)
v (1 - d) = 0. (4)
g (1 - m) = 0. (5)
v (1 - g) = 0. (6)
We shall first eliminate from (2), (3), and (4) the symbol d, and then determine
v in relation to p, f, and h. Now the addition of (2), (3), and (4) gives
(p + f) d + v (1 - d) = 0.
From which, eliminating d in the ordinary way, we find
(p + f) v = 0. (7)
Adding this to (1), and determining v, we find
v =
0
p + f + 1 - p (1 - f) (1 - h) - f (1 - p) (1 - h) - h (1 - f) (1 - p)
.
Whence by development,
v =
0
0
h (1 - f) (1 - p).
The interpretation of this equation is: Virtue is a habit, and not a faculty or a
passion.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 105
Next, we will eliminate f, p, and g from the original system of equations,
and then determine v in relation to h, d, and m. We will in this case eliminate
p and f together. On addition of (1), (2), and (3), we get
v{1 - p(1 - f)(1 - h) - f(1 - p)(1 - h) - h(1 - p)(1 - f)}
+pd + f d = 0.
Developing this with reference to p and f, we have
(v + 2d)pf + (vh + d)p(1 - f) + (vh + d)(1 - p)f
+v(1 - h)(1 - p)(1 - f) = 0.
Whence the result of elimination will be
(v + 2d)(vh + d)(vh + d)v(1 - h) = 0.
Now v + 2d = v + d + d, which by Prop. I. is reducible to v + d. The product
of this and the second factor is
(v + d)(vh + d),
which by Prop. II. reduces to d + v(vh) or vh + d.
In like manner, this result, multiplied by the third factor, gives simply vh+d.
Lastly, this multiplied by the fourth factor, v(1-h), gives, as the final equation,
vd(l - h) = 0 (8)
It remains to eliminate g from (5) and (6). The result is
v(1 - m) = 0 (9)
Finally, the equations (4), (8), and (9) give on addition
v(1 - d) + vd(1 - h) + v(1 - m) = 0
from which we have
v =
0
1 - d + d(1 - h) + 1 - m
.
And the development of this result gives
v =
0
0
hdm,
f which the interpretation is,–Virtue is a habit accompanied by deliberate preference,
and keeping in view the mean relative to human nature.
Properly speaking, this is not a definition, but a description of virtue. It is
all, however, that can be correctly inferred from the premises. Aristotle specially
connects with it the necessity of prudence, to determine the safe and middle line
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 106
of action; and there is no doubt that the ancient theories of virtue generally partook
more of an intellectual character than those (the theory of utility excepted)
which have most prevailed in modern days. Virtue was regarded as consisting in
the right state and habit of the whole mind, rather than in the single supremacy
of conscience or the moral facility. And to some extent those theories were undoubtedly
right. For though unqualified obedience to the dictates of conscience
is an essential element of virtuous conduct, yet the conformity of those dictates
with those unchanging principles of rectitude (a????a d??a?a)which are founded
in, or which rather are themselves the foundation of the constitution of things,
is another element. And generally this conformity, in any high degree at least,
is inconsistent with a state of ignorance and mental hebetude. Reverting to
the particular theory of Aristotle, it will probably appear to most that it is of
too negative a character, and that the shunning of extremes does not afford a
sufficient scope for the expenditure of the nobler energies of our being. Aristotle
seems to have been imperfectly conscious of this defect of his system, when in
the opening of his seventh book he spoke of an “heroic virtue”1
rising above the
measure of human nature.
7. I have already remarked (VIII. 1) that the theory of single equations or
propositions comprehends questions which cannot be fully answered, except in
connexion with the theory of systems of equations. This remark is exemplified
when it is proposed to determine from a given single equation the relation, not
of some single elementary class, but of some compound class, involving in its
expression more than one element, in terms of the remaining elements. The
following particular example, and the succeeding general problem, are of this
nature.
Ex. 2.—Let us resume the symbolical expression of the definition of wealth
employed in Chap, VII., viz.,
w = st {p + r (l - p)} ,
wherein, as before,
w = wealth,
s = things limited in supply,
t = things transferable,
p = things productive of pleasure,
r = things preventive of pain;
and suppose it required to determine hence the relation of things transferable
and productive of pleasure, to the other elements of the definition, viz., wealth,
things limited in supply, and things preventive of pain.
The expression for things transferable and productive of pleasure is tp. Let
us represent this by a new symbol y. We have then the equations
w = st {p + r (1 - p)} ,
y = tp,
1t?? ?p?? ?µ?? ??et?? ??????? t??a ?a? ?e?a?–Nic. Eth. Book vii.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 107
from which, if we eliminate t and p, we may determine y as a function of w, s,
and r. The result interpreted will give the relation sought.
Bringing the terms of these equations to the first side, we have
w - stp - str (1 - p) = 0.
y - tp = 0. (3)
And adding the squares of these equations together,
w + stp + str (1 - p) - 2wstp - 2wstr (1 - p) + y + tp - 2ytp = 0. (4)
Developing the first member with respect to t and p, in order to eliminate those
symbols, we have
(w + s - 2ws + 1 - y)tp + (w + sr - 2wsr + y)t(1 - p)
+ (w + y) (1 - t) p + (w + y) (1 - t) (1 - p) ; (5)
and the result of the elimination of t and p will be obtained by equating to 0
the product of the four coefficients of
tp, t(1 - p),(1 - t) p, and (1 - t) (1 - p).
Or, by Prop. 3, the result of the elimination of t and p from the above
equation will be of the form
Ey + E
0
(1 - y),
wherein E is the result obtained by changing in the given equation y into 1,
and then eliminating t and p; and E0
the result obtained by changing in the
same equation y into 0, and then eliminating t and p. And the mode in each
case of eliminating t and p is to multiply together the coefficients of the four
constituents tp, t(1 - p), &c.
If we make y = 1, the coefficients become–
1st. w (1 - s) + s (1 - w)
2nd. 1 + w (1 - sr) + s (1 - w) r, equivalent to 1 by Prop. I.
3rd and 4th. 1 + w, equivalent to 1 by Prop. I.
Hence the value of E will be
w (1 - s) + s (1 - w).
Again, in (5) making y = 0, we have for the coefficients–
1st. 1 + w (1 - s) + s (1 - w), equivalent to 1.
2nd. w (1 - sr) + sr (1 - w).
3rd and 4th. w.
The product of these coefficients gives
E
0 = w (1 - sr).
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 108
The equation from which y is to be determined, therefore, is
{w(1 - s) + s(1 - w)} y + w(1 - sr)(1 - y) = 0,
? y =
w(1 - sr)
w(1 - sr) - w(1 - s) - s(1 - w)
;
and expanding the second member,
y =
0
0wsr + ws(1 - r) + 1
0w(1 - s)r +
1
0w(1 - s)(1 - r)
+0(1 - w)sr + 0(1 - w)s(1 - r) + 0
0
(1 - w)(1 - s)r
+
0
0
(1 - w)(1 - s)(1 - r);
whence reducing.
y = ws(1 - r) + 0
0
wsr +
0
0
(1 - w)(1 - s), (6)
with w(1 - s) = 0. (7)
The interpretation of which is–
1st. Things transferable and productive of pleasure consist of all wealth (limited
in supply and) not preventive of pain, an indefinite amount of wealth (limited
in supply and) preventive of pain, and an indefinite amount of what is not
wealth and not limited in supply.
2nd. All wealth is limited in supply.
I have in the above solution written in parentheses that part of the full
description which is implied by the accompanying independent relation (7).
8. The following problem is of a more general nature, and will furnish an
easy practical rule for problems such as the last.
General Problem.
Given any equation connecting the symbols x, y..w, z..
Required to determine the logical expression of any class expressed in any
way by the symbols x, y.. in terms of the remaining symbols, w, z, &c.
Let us confine ourselves to the case in which there are but two symbols, x,
y, and two symbols, w, z, a case sufficient to determine the general Rule.
Let V = 0 be the given equation, and let f(x, y) represent the class whose
expression is to be determined.
Assume t = f(x, y), then, from the above two equations, x and y are to be
eliminated.
Now the equation V = 0 may be expanded in the form
Axy + Bx(1 - y) + C(1 - x)y + D(1 - x)(1 - y) = 0, (1)
A, B, C, and D being functions of the symbols w and z.
Again, as f(x, y) represents a class or collection of things, it must consist of
a constituent, or series of constituents, whose coefficients are 1.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 109
Wherefore if the full development of f(x, y) be represented in the form
axy + bx(l - y) + c(l - x)y + d(1 - x)(1 - y),
the coefficients a, b, c, d must each be 1 or 0.
Now reducing the equation t = f(x, y) by transposition and squaring, to the
form
t1 - f(x, y) + f(x, y)(1 - t) = 0;
and expanding with reference to x and y, we get
t(1 - a) + a(1 - t)xy + t(1 - b) + b(1 - t)x(1 - y)
+t(1 - c) + c(1 - t)(1 - x)y
+t(1 - d) + d(1 - t)(1 - x)(1 - y) = 0;
whence, adding this to (1), we have
A + t(1 - a) + a(1 - t)xy
+B + t(l - b) + b(l - t)x(1 - y) + &c. = 0.
Let the result of the elimination of x and y be of the form
Et + E
0
(1 - t) = 0,
then E will, by what has been said, be the reduced product of what the
coefficients of the above expansion become when t = 1 , and E0
the product of
the same factors similarly reduced by the condition t = 0.
Hence E will be the reduced product
(A + 1 - a)(B + 1 - b)(C + 1 - c)(D + 1 - d).
Considering any factor of this expression, as A + 1 - a, we see that when a = 1
it becomes A, and when a = 0 it becomes 1 + A, which reduces by Prop. I. to
1. Hence we may infer that E will be the product of the coefficients of those
constituents in the development of V whose coefficients in the development of
f(x, y) are 1.
Moreover E0 will be the reduced product
(A + a)(B + b)(C + c)(D + d).
Considering any one of these factors, as A + a, we see that this becomes A
when a = 0, and reduces to 1 when a = 1 ; and so on for the others. Hence E
will be the product of the coefficients of those constituents in the development
of y, whose coefficients in the development f(x, y) are 0. Viewing these cases
together, we may establish the following Rule:
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 110
9. To deduce from a logical equation the relation of any class expressed by
a given combination of the symbols x, y, &c, to the classes represented by any
other symbols involved in the given equation.
Rule.–Expand the given equation with reference to the symbols x, y. Then
form the equation
Et + E
0
(1 - t) = 0,
in which E is the product of the coefficients of all those constituents in the above
development, whose coefficients in the expression of the given class are 1, and
E0
the product of the coefficients of those constituents of the development whose
coefficients in the expression of the given class are 0. The value of t deduced
from the above equation by solution and interpretation will be the expression
required.
Note.–Although in the demonstration of this Rule V is supposed to consist
solely of positive terms, it may easily be shown that this condition is unnecessary,
and the Rule general, and that no preparation of the given equation is really
required.
10. Ex. 3.–The same definition of wealth being given as in Example 2,
required an expression for things transferable, but not productive of pleasure,
t(1 - p), in terms of the other elements represented by w, s, and r.
The equation
w - stp - str(1 - p) = 0,
gives, when squared,
w + stp + str(1 - p) - 2wstp - 2wstr(1 - p) = 0;
and developing the first member with respect to t and p,
(w + s - 2ws)tp + (w + sr - 2wsr)t(1 - p) + w(1 - t)p
+w(1 - t)(1 - p) = 0.
The coefficients of which it is best to exhibit as in the following equation;
w(1 - s) + s(1 - w)tp + w(1 - sr) + sr(1 - w)t(1 - p) + w(1 - t)p
+w(1 - t)(1 - p) = 0
Let the function t(1 - p) to be determined, be represented by z; then the
full development of z in respect of t and p is
z = 0tp + t(1 - p) + 0(1 - t)p + 0(1 - t)(1 - p).
Hence, by the last problem, we have
Ez + E
0
(1 - z) = 0;
where E = w(1 - sr) + sr(1 - w);
E
0 = w(1 - s) + s(1 - w) × w × w = w(1 - s);
? w(1 - sr) + sr(1 - w)z + w(1 - s)(1 - z) = 0.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 111
Hence,
z =
w(1 - s)
2wsr - ws - sr
=
0
0
wsr + 0ws(1 - r) + 1
0
w(1 - s)r +
1
0
w(1 - s)(1 - r),
+0(1 - w)sr +
0
0
(1 - w)s(1 - r) + 0
0
(1 - w)(1 - s)r
+
0
0
(1 - w)(1 - s)(1 - r).
Or, z =
0
0
wsr +
0
0
(1 - w)s(1 - r) + 0
0
(1 - w)(1 - s),
with w(1 - s) = 0.
Hence, Things transferable and not productive of pleasure are either wealth
(limited in supply and preventive of pain); or things which are not wealth, but
limited in supply and not preventive of pain; or things which are not wealth, and
are unlimited in supply.
The following results, deduced in a similar manner, will be easily verified:
Things limited in supply and productive of pleasure which are not wealth,–are
intransferable.
Wealth that is not productive of pleasure is transferable, limited in supply,
and preventive of pain.
Things limited in supply which are either wealth, or are productive of pleasure,
but not both,–are either transferable and preventive of pain, or intransferable.
11. From the domain of natural history a large number of curious examples
might be selected. I do not, however, conceive that such applications would
possess any independent value. They would, for instance, throw no light upon
the true principles of classification in the science of zoology. For the discovery
of these, some basis of positive knowledge is requisite,–some acquaintance with
organic structure, with teleological adaptation; and this is a species of knowledge
which can only be derived from the use of external means of observation and
analysis. Taking, however, any collection of propositions in natural history,
a great number of logical problems present themselves, without regard to the
system of classification adopted. Perhaps in forming such examples, it is better
to avoid, as superfluous, the mention of that property of a class or species which
is immediately suggested by its name, e.g. the ring-structure in the annelida, a
class of animals including the earth-worm and the leech.
Ex. 4.–1. The annelida are soft-bodied, and either naked or enclosed in a
tube.
2. The annelida consist of all invertebrate animals having red blood in a
double system of circulating vessels.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 112
Assume a = annelida;
s = soft-bodied animals;
n = naked;
t = enclosed in a tube;
i = invertebrate;
r = having red blood, &c.
Then the propositions given will be expressed by the equations
a = vsn(1 - t) + t(1 - n); (1)
a = ir; (2)
to which we may add the implied condition,
nt = 0. (3)
On eliminating v, and reducing the system to a single equation, we have
a[1 - sn(1 - t) - st(1 - n)] + a(1 - ir) + ir(1 - a) + nt = 0. (4)
Suppose that we wish to obtain the relation in which soft-bodied animals
enclosed in tubes arc placed (by virtue of the premises) with respect to the
following elements, viz., the possession of red blood, of an external covering,
and of a vertebral column.
We must first eliminate a. The result is
ir1 - sn(1 - t) - st(1 - n) + nt = 0.
Then (IX. 9) developing with respect to s and t, and reducing the first
coefficient by Prop. 1, we have
nst + ir(1 - n)s(1 - t) + (ir + n)(1 - s)t + ir(1 - s)(1 - t) = 0. (5)
Hence, if st = w, we find
nw + ir(1 - n) × (ir + n) × ir(1 - w) = 0;
or,
nw + ir(1 - n)(1 - w) = 0;
? w =
ir(1 - n)
ir(1 - n) - n
= 0irn + ir(1 - n) + 0i(1 - r)n +
0
0
i(1 - r)(1 - n)
+0(1 - i)rn +
0
0
(1 - i)r(1 - n) + 0(1 - i)(1 - r)n
+
0
0
(1 - i)(1 - r)(1 - n);
or, w = ir(1 - n) + 0
0
i(1 - r)(1 - n) + 0
0
(1 - i)(1 - n).
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 113
Hence, soft-bodied animals enclosed in tubes consist of all invertebrate animals
having red blood and not naked, and an indefinite remainder of invertebrate
animals not having red blood and not naked, and of vertebrate animals which
are not naked.
And in an exactly similar manner, the following reduced equations, the interpretation
of which is left to the reader, have been deduced from the development
(5).
s(1 - t) = irn +
0
0
i(1 - n) + 0
0
(1 - i)
(1 - s)t =

(1 - i)r(1 - n) + 0
0
(1 - r)(1 - n)
(1 - s)(1 - t) = 0
0
i(1 - r) + 0
0
(1 - i).
In none of the above examples has it been my object to exhibit in any special
manner the power of the method. That, I conceive, can only be fully displayed
in connexion with the mathematical theory of probabilities. I would, however,
suggest to any who may be desirous of forming a correct opinion upon this
point, that they examine by the rules of ordinary logic the following problem,
before inspecting its solution; remembering at the same time, that whatever
complexity it possesses might be multiplied indefinitely, with no other effect
than to render its solution by the method of this work more operose, but not
less certainly attainable.
Ex. 5. Let the observation of a class of natural productions be supposed to
have led to the following general results.
1st, That in whichsoever of these productions the properties A and C are
missing, the property E is found, together with one of the properties B and D,
but not with both.
2nd, That wherever the properties A and D are found while E is missing,
the properties B and C will either both be found, or both be missing.
3rd, That wherever the property A is found in conjunction with either B
or E, or both of them, there either the property C or the property D will be
found, but not both of them. And conversely, wherever the property C or D is
found singly, there the property A will be found in conjunction with either B
or E, or both of them.
Let it then be required to ascertain, first, what in any particular instance may
be concluded from the ascertained presence of the property A, with reference
to the properties B, C, and D; also whether any relations exist independently
among the properties B, C, and D. Secondly, what may be concluded in like
manner respecting the property B, and the properties A, C, and D.
It will be observed, that in each of the three data, the information conveyed
respecting the properties A, B, C, and D, is complicated with another element,
E, about which we desire to say nothing in our conclusion. It will hence be
requisite to eliminate the symbol representing the property E from the system
of equations, by which the given propositions will be expressed.
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 114
Let us represent the property A by x, B by y, C by z, D by w, E by v. The
data are
x¯z¯ = qv(yw¯ + wy¯); (1)
vxw ¯ = q(yz + ¯yz¯); (2)
xy + xvy¯ = wz¯ + zw¯; (3)
x¯ standing for 1-x, &c., and q being an indefinite class symbol. Eliminating
q separately from the first and second equations, and adding the results to the
third equation reduced by (5), Chap.VIII., we get
x¯z¯(1 - vyw¯ - vwy¯) + ¯vxw(yz¯ + zy¯) + (xy + xvy¯)(wz + ¯wz¯)
+ (wz¯ + zw¯)(1 - xy - xvy¯) = 0. (4)
From this equation v must be eliminated, and the value of x determined
from the result. For effecting this object, it will be convenient to employ the
method of Prop. 3 of the present chapter.
Let then the result of elimination be represented by the equation
Ex + E
0
(l - x) = 0.
To find E make x = 1 in the first member of (4), we find
vw¯ (yz¯ + zy¯) + (y + vy¯)(wz + ¯wz¯) + (wz¯ + zw¯)¯vy. ¯
Eliminating v, we have
(wz + ¯wz¯) {w(yz¯ + zy¯) + y(wz + ¯wz¯) + ¯y(wz¯ + zw¯)} ;
which, on actual multiplication, in accordance with the conditions ww¯ = 0,
zz¯ = 0, &c., gives
E = wz + yw¯z¯
Next, to find E0 make x = 0 in (4), we have
z(1 - vyw¯ - vyw¯ ) + wz¯ + zw. ¯
whence, eliminating v, and reducing the result by Propositions 1 and 2, we
find
E
0 = wz¯ + zw¯ + ¯yw¯z¯;
and, therefore, finally we have
(wz + yw¯z¯)x + (wz¯ + zw¯ + ¯yw¯z¯)¯x = 0; (5)
from which
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 115
x =
wz¯ + zw¯ + ¯yw¯z¯
wz¯ + zw¯ + ¯yw¯z¯ - wz - yw¯z¯
wherefore, by development,
x = 0yzw + yzw¯ + yzw¯ + 0yz¯w¯
+0¯yzw + ¯yzw¯ + ¯yzw¯ + ¯yz¯x¯;
or, collecting the terms in vertical columns,
x = zw¯ + ¯zw + ¯yz¯w¯; (6)
the interpretation of which is–
In whatever substances the property A is found, there will also be found
either the property C or the property D, but not both, or else the properties B,
C, and D, will all be wanting. And conversely, where either the property C
or the property D is found singly, or the properties B, C, and D, are together
missing, there the property A will be found.
It also appears that there is no independent relation among the properties
B, C, and D.
Secondly, we are to find y. Now developing (5) with respect to that symbol,
(xwz + xw¯z¯ + ¯xwz¯ + ¯xzw¯)y + (xwz + ¯xwz¯ + ¯xzw¯ + ¯xz¯w¯)¯y = 0;
whence, proceeding as before,
y = ¯xw¯z¯ +
0
0
(¯xwz + xwz¯ + xzw¯), (7)
xzw = 0; (8)
xz¯ zw¯ = 0; (9)
xz¯ w¯ = 0; (10)
From (10) reduced by solution to the form
xz¯ =
0
0
w;
we have the independent relation,–If the property A is absent and C present,
D is present. Again, by addition and solution (8) and (9) give
xz + ¯xz¯ =
0
0
w. ¯
Whence we have for the general solution and the remaining independent
relation:
CHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 116
1st. If the property B be present in one of the productions, either the properties
A, C, and D, are all absent, or some one alone of them is absent. And
conversely, if they are all absent it may be concluded that the property A is
present (7).
2nd. If A and C are both present or both absent, D will be absent, quite
independently of the presence or absence of B (8) and (9).
I have not attempted to verify these conclusions.
Chapter X
OF THE CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD.
1. The subject of Primary Propositions has been discussed at length, and we are
about to enter upon the consideration of Secondary Propositions. The interval
of transition between these two great divisions of the science of Logic may afford
a fit occasion for us to pause, and while reviewing some of the past steps of our
progress, to inquire what it is that in a subject like that with which we have
been occupied constitutes perfection of method. I do not here speak of that
perfection only which consists in power, but of that also which is founded in the
conception of what is fit and beautiful. It is probable that a careful analysis
of this question would conduct us to some such conclusion as the following,
viz., that a perfect method should not only be an efficient one, as respects the
accomplishment of the objects for which it is designed, but should in all its parts
and processes manifest a certain unity and harmony. This conception would be
most fully realized if even the very forms of the method were suggestive of
the fundamental principles, and if possible of the one fundamental principle,
upon which they are founded. In applying these considerations to the science
of Reasoning, it may be well to extend our view beyond the mere analytical
processes, and to inquire what is best as respects not only the mode or form of
deduction, but also the system of data or premises from which the deduction is
to be made.
2. As respects mere power, there is no doubt that the first of the methods
developed in Chapter VIII. is, within its proper sphere, a perfect one. The
introduction of arbitrary constants makes us independent of the forms of the
premises, as well as of any conditions among the equations by which they are
represented. But it seems to introduce a foreign element, and while it is a more
laborious, it is also a less elegant form of solution than the second method of
reduction demonstrated in the same chapter. There are, however, conditions
under which the latter method assumes a more perfect form than it otherwise
bears. To make the one fundamental condition expressed by the equation
x(1 - x) = 0,
the universal type of form, would give a unity of character to both processes
and results, which would not else be attainable. Were brevity or convenience the
117
CHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 118
only valuable quality of a method, no advantage would flow from the adoption
of such a principle. For to impose upon every step of a solution the character
above described, would involve in some instances no slight labour of preliminary
reduction. But it is still interesting to know that this can be done, and it is even
of some importance to be acquainted with the conditions under which such a
form of solution would spontaneously present itself. Some of these points will
be considered in the present chapter.
Proposition I.
3. To reduce any equation among logical symbols to the form V = 0, in which
V satisfies the law of duality,
V (1 - V ) = 0.
It is shown in Chap. V. Prop. 4, that the above condition is satisfied whenever
V is the sum of a series of constituents. And it is evident from Prop. 2,
Chap. VI. that all equations are equivalent which, when reduced by transposition
to the form V = 0, produce, by development of the first member, the
same series of constituents with coefficients which do not vanish; the particular
numerical values of those coefficients being immaterial.
Hence the object of this Proposition may always be accomplished by bringing
all the terms of an equation to the first side, fully expanding that member, and
changing in the result all the coefficients which do not vanish into unity, except
such as have already that value.
But as the development of functions containing many symbols conducts us
to expressions inconvenient from their great length, it is desirable to show how,
in the only cases which do practically offer themselves to our notice, this source
of complexity may be avoided.
The great primary forms of equations have already been discussed in Chapter
VIII. They are–
X = vY,
X = Y,
vX = vY.
Whenever the conditions X(1- X) = 0, Y (1-Y ) = 0, are satisfied, we have
seen that the two first of the above equations conduct us to the forms
X(1 - Y ) = 0, (1)
X(1 - Y ) + Y (1 - X) = 0; (2)
and under the same circumstances it may be shown that the last of them
gives
CHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 119
v(X(1 - Y ) + Y (1 - X)) = 0; (3)
all which results obviously satisfy, in their first members, the condition
V (1 - V ) = 0.
Now as the above are the forms and conditions under which the equations
of a logical system properly expressed do actually present themselves, it is always
possible to reduce them by the above method into subjection to the law
required. Though, however, the separate equations may thus satisfy the law,
their equivalent sum (VIII. 4) may not do so, and it remains to show how upon
it also the requisite condition may be imposed.
Let us then represent the equation formed by adding the several reduced
equations of the system together, in the form
v + v
0 + v
00
, &c. = 0, (4)
this equation being singly equivalent to the system from which it was obtained.
We suppose v, v0
, v00, &c. to be class terms (IX. 1) satisfying the conditions
v(1 - v) = 0, v0
(1 - v
0
) = 0, &c.
Now the full interpretation of (4) would be found by developing the first
member with respect to all the elementary symbols x, y, &c. which it contains,
and equating to 0 all the constituents whose coefficients do not vanish; in other
words, all the constituents which are found in either v, v
0
, v
00, &c. But those
constituents consist of–1st, such as are found in v; 2nd, such as are not found in
v, but are found in v
0
; 3rd, such as are neither found in v nor v
0
, but are found
in v
00, and so on. Hence they will be such as are found in the expression
v + (1 - v)v
0 + (1 - v)(1 - v)v
00 + &c., (5)
an expression in which no constituents are repeated, and which obviously satisfies
the law V (1 - V ) = 0.
Thus if we had the expression
(1 - t) + v + (1 - z) + tzw,
in which the terms 1 - t, 1 - z are bracketed to indicate that they are to be
taken as single class terms, we should, in accordance with (5), reduce it to an
expression satisfying the condition V (1 - V ) = 0, by multiplying all the terms
after the first by t, then all after the second by 1 - v; lastly, the term which
remains after the third by z; the result being
1 - t + tv + t(1 - v)(1 - z) + t(1 - v)zw. (6)
4. All logical equations then are reducible to the form V = 0, V satisfying
the law of duality. But it would obviously be a higher degree of perfection
CHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 120
if equations always presented themselves in such a form, without preparation
of any kind, and not only exhibited this form in their original statement, but
retained it unimpaired after those additions which are necessary in order to
reduce systems of equations to single equivalent forms. That they do not spontaneously
present this feature is not properly attributable to defect of method,
but is a consequence of the fact that our premises are not always complete, and
accurate, and independent. They are not complete when they involve material
(as distinguished from formal) relations, which are not expressed. They are not
accurate when they imply relations which are not intended. But setting aside
these points, with which, in the present instance, we are less concerned, let it
be considered in what sense they may fail of being independent.
5. A system of propositions may be termed independent, when it is not
possible to deduce from any portion of the system a conclusion deducible from
any other portion of it. Supposing the equations representing those propositions
all reduced to the form
V = 0,
then the above condition implies that no constituent which can be made to
appear in the development of a particular function V of the system, can be made
to appear in the development of any other function V
0 of the same system. When
this condition is not satisfied, the equations of the system are not independent.
This may happen in various cases. Let all the equations satisfy in their first
members the law of duality, then if there appears a positive term x in the
expansion of one equation, and a term xy in that of another, the equations are
not independent, for the term x is further developable into xy + x(1 - y), and
the equation
xy = 0
is thus involved in both the equations of the system. Again, let a term xy appear
in one equation, and a term xz in another. Both these may be developed so as
to give the common constituent xyz. And other cases may easily be imagined
in which premises which appear at first sight to be quite independent are not
really so. Whenever equations of the form V = 0 are thus not truly independent,
though individually they may satisfy the law of duality,
V (1 - V ) = 0,
the equivalent equation obtained by adding them together will not satisfy that
condition, unless sufficient reductions by the method of the present chapter
have been performed. When, on the other hand, the equations of a system both
satisfy the above law, and are independent of each other, their sum will also
satisfy the same law. I have dwelt upon these points at greater length than
would otherwise have been necessary, because it appears to me to be important
to endeavour to form to ourselves, and to keep before us in all our investigations,
the pattern of an ideal perfection,—the object and the guide of future efforts. In
the present class of inquiries the chief aim of improvement of method should be
to facilitate, as far as is consistent with brevity, the transformation of equations,
so as to make the fundamental condition above adverted to universal.
CHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 121
In connexion with this subject the following Propositions are deserving of
attention.
Proposition II.
If the first member of any equation V = 0 satisfy the condition V (1 - V ) =
0, and if the expression of any symbol t of that equation be determined as a
developed function of the other symbols, the coefficients of the expansion can
only assume the forms 1, 0,
0
0
,
1
0
.
For if the equation be expanded with reference to t, we obtain as the result,
Et + E
0
(1 - t), (1)
E and E0 being what V becomes when t is successively changed therein into 1
and 0. Hence E and E0 will themselves satisfy the conditions
E(1 - E) = 0, E0
(1 - E
0
) = 0. (2)
Now (1) gives
t =
E0
E0 - E
,
the second member of which is to be expanded as a function of the remaining
symbols. It is evident that the only numerical values which E and E0
can receive
in the calculation of the coefficients will be 1 and 0. The following cases alone
can therefore arise:
1st. E0 = 1, E = 1, then E0
E0 - E
=
1
0
.
2nd. E0 = 1, E = 0, then E0
E0 - E
= 1.
3rd. E0 = 0, E = 1, then E0
E0 - E
= 0.
4th. E0 = 0, E = 0, then E0
E0 - E
=
0
0
.
Whence the truth of the Proposition is manifest.
6. It may be remarked that the forms 1, 0, and 0
0
appear in the solution of
equations independently of any reference to the condition V (1 - V ) = 0. But it
is not so with the coefficient 1
0
. The terms to which this coefficient is attached
when the above condition is satisfied may receive any other value except the
three values 1, 0, and 0
0
, when that condition is not satisfied. It is permitted,
and it would conduce to uniformity, to change any coefficient of a development
not presenting itself in any of the four forms referred to in this Proposition into
1
0
, regarding this as the symbol proper to indicate that the coefficient to which
it is attached should be equated to 0. This course I shall frequently adopt.

7. The result of the elimination of any symbols x, y, &c. from an equation
V = 0, of which the first member identically satisfies the law of duality,
V (1 - V ) = 0,
may be obtained by developing the given equation with reference to the other
symbols, and equating to 0 the sum of those constituents whose coefficients in
the expansion are equal to unity.
Suppose that the given equation V = 0 involves but three symbols, x, y, and
t, of which x and y are to be eliminated. Let the development of the equation,
with respect to t, be
At + B(1 - t) = 0, (1)
A and B being free from the symbol t.
By Chap. IX. Prop. 3, the result of the elimination of x and y from the
given equation will be of the form
Et + E
0
(1 - t) = 0, (2)
in which E is the result obtained by eliminating the symbols x and y from the
equation A = 0, E0
the result obtained by eliminating from the equation B = 0.
Now A and B must satisfy the condition
A(1 - A) = 0, B(1 - B) = 0
Hence A (confining ourselves for the present to this coefficient) will either
be 0 or 1, or a constituent, or the sum of a part of the constituents which
involve the symbols x and y. If A = 0 it is evident that E = 0; if A is a single
constituent, or the sum of a part of the constituents involving x and y, E will
be 0. For the full development of A, with respect to x and y, will contain terms
with vanishing coefficients, and E is the product of all the coefficients. Hence
when A = 1, E is equal to A, but in other cases E is equal to 0. Similarly, when
B = 1, E is equal to B, but in other cases E vanishes. Hence the expression (2)
will consist of that part, if any there be, of (1) in which the coefficients A, B
are unity. And this reasoning is general. Suppose, for instance, that V involved
the symbols x, y, z, t, and that it were required to eliminate x and y. Then if
the development of V , with reference to z and t, were
zt + xz(1 - t) + y(1 - z)t + (1 - z)(1 - t),
the result sought would be
zt + (1 - z)(1 - t) = 0,
this being that portion of the development of which the coefficients are unity.
Hence, if from any system of equations we deduce a single equivalent equation
V = 0, V satisfying the condition
V (1 - V ) = 0,
CHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 123
the ordinary processes of elimination may be entirely dispensed with, and
the single process of development made to supply their place.
8. It may be that there is no practical advantage in the method thus pointed
out, but it possesses a theoretical unity and completeness which render it deserving
of regard, and I shall accordingly devote a future chapter (XIV.) to its
illustration. The progress of applied mathematics has presented other and signal
examples of the reduction of systems of problems or equations to the dominion
of some central but pervading law.
9. It is seen from what precedes that there is one class of propositions
to which all the special appliances of the above methods of preparation are
unnecessary. It is that which is characterized by the following conditions:
First, That the propositions are of the ordinary kind, implied by the use of
the copula is or are, the predicates being particular.
Secondly, That the terms of the proposition are intelligible without the supposition
of any understood relation among the elements which enter into the
expression of those terms.
Thirdly, That the propositions are independent.
We may, if such speculation is not altogether vain, permit ourselves to conjecture
that these are the conditions which would be obeyed in the employment
of language as an instrument of expression and of thought, by unerring beings,
declaring simply what they mean, without suppression on the one hand, and
without repetition on the other. Considered both in their relation to the idea
of a perfect language, and in their relation to the processes of an exact method,
these conditions are equally worthy of the attention of the student.
Chapter XI
OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS, AND OF THE
PRINCIPLES OF THEIR SYMBOLICAL EXPRESSION.
1. The doctrine has already been established in Chap. IV., that every logical
proposition may be referred to one or the other of two great classes, viz., Primary
Propositions and Secondary Propositions. The former of these classes has been
discussed in the preceding chapters of this work, and we are now led to the
consideration of Secondary Propositions, i.e. of Propositions concerning, or
relating to, other propositions regarded as true or false. The investigation upon
which we are entering will, in its general order and progress, resemble that
which we have already conducted. The two inquiries differ as to the subjects
of thought which they recognise, not as to the formal and scientific laws which
they reveal, or the methods or processes which are founded upon those laws.
Probability would in some measure favour the expectation of such a result. It
consists with all that we know of the uniformity of Nature, and all that we
believe of the immutable constancy of the Author of Nature, to suppose, that
in the mind, which has been endowed with such high capabilities, not only
for converse with surrounding scenes, but for the knowledge of itself, and for
reflection upon the laws of its own constitution, there should exist a harmony
and uniformity not less real than that which the study of the physical sciences
makes known to us. Anticipations such as this are never to be made the primary
rule of our inquiries, nor are they in any degree to divert us from those labours
of patient research by which we ascertain what is the actual constitution of
things within the particular province submitted to investigation. But when the
grounds of resemblance have been properly and independently determined, it
is not inconsistent, even with purely scientific ends, to make that resemblance
a subject of meditation, to trace its extent, and to receive the intimations of
truth, yet undiscovered, which it may seem to us to convey. The necessity of
a final appeal to fact is not thus set aside, nor is the use of analogy extended
beyond its proper sphere,–the suggestion of relations which independent inquiry
must either verify or cause to be rejected.
2. Secondary Propositions are those which concern or relate to Propositions
considered as true or false. The relations of things we express by primary propositions.
But we are able to make Propositions themselves also the subject of
124
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 125
thought, and to express our judgments concerning them. The expression of any
such judgment constitutes a secondary proposition. There exists no proposition
whatever of which a competent degree of knowledge would not enable us to
make one or the other of these two assertions, viz., either that the proposition is
true, or that it is false; and each of these assertions is a secondary proposition.
“It is true that the sun shines;” “It is not true that the planets shine by their
own light;” are examples of this kind. In the former example the Proposition
“The sun shines,” is asserted to be true. In the latter, the Proposition, “The
planets shine by their own light,” is asserted to be false. Secondary propositions
also include all judgments by which we express a relation or dependence among
propositions. To this class or division we may refer conditional propositions,
as, “If the sun shine the day will be fair.” Also most disjunctive propositions,
as, “Either the sun will shine, or the enterprise will be postponed.” In the former
example we express the dependence of the truth of the Proposition, “The
day will be fair,” upon the truth of the Proposition, “The sun will shine.” In
the latter we express a relation between the two Propositions, “The sun will
shine,” “The enterprise will be postponed,” implying that the truth of the one
excludes the truth of the other. To the same class of secondary propositions
we must also refer all those propositions which assert the simultaneous truth or
falsehood of propositions, as, “It is not true both that ‘the sun will shine’ and
that ‘the journey will be postponed.’ ” The elements of distinction which we
have noticed may even be blended together in the same secondary proposition.
It may involve both the disjunctive element expressed by either, or, and the
conditional element expressed by if ; in addition to which, the connected propositions
may themselves be of a compound character. If “the sun shine,” and
“leisure permit,” then either “the enterprise shall be commenced,” or “some
preliminary step shall be taken.” In this example a number of propositions are
connected together, not arbitrarily and unmeaningly, but in such a manner as
to express a definite connexion between them,–a connexion having reference to
their respective truth or falsehood. This combination, therefore, according to
our definition, forms a Secondary Proposition.
The theory of Secondary Propositions is deserving of attentive study, as well
on account of its varied applications, as for that close and harmonious analogy,
already referred to, which it sustains with the theory of Primary Propositions.
Upon each of these points I desire to offer a few further observations.
3. I would in the first place remark, that it is in the form of secondary
propositions, at least as often as in that of primary propositions, that the reasonings
of ordinary life are exhibited. The discourses, too, of the moralist and
the metaphysician are perhaps less often concerning things and their qualities,
than concerning principles and hypotheses, concerning truths and the mutual
connexion and relation of truths. The conclusions which our narrow experience
suggests in relation to the great questions of morals and society yet unsolved,
manifest, in more ways than one, the limitations of their human origin; and
though the existence of universal principles is not to be questioned, the partial
formulae which comprise our knowledge of their application are subject to
conditions, and exceptions, and failure. Thus, in those departments of inquiry
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 126
which, from the nature of their subject-matter, should be the most interesting of
all, much of our actual knowledge is hypothetical. That there has been a strong
tendency to the adoption of the same forms of thought in writers on speculative
philosophy, will hereafter appear. Hence the introduction of a general method
for the discussion of hypothetical and the other varieties of secondary propositions,
will open to us a more interesting field of applications than we have before
met with.
4. The discussion of the theory of Secondary Propositions is in the next
place interesting, from the close and remarkable analogy which it bears with
the theory of Primary Propositions. It will appear, that the formal laws to
which the operations of the mind are subject, are identical in expression in
both cases. The mathematical processes which are founded on those laws are,
therefore, identical also. Thus the methods which have been investigated in the
former portion of this work will continue to be available in the new applications
to which we are about to proceed. But while the laws and processes of the
method remain unchanged, the rule of interpretation must be adapted to new
conditions. Instead of classes of things, we shall have to substitute propositions,
and for the relations of classes and individuals, we shall have to consider the
connexions of propositions or of events. Still, between the two systems, however
differing in purport and interpretation, there will be seen to exist a pervading
harmonious relation, an analogy which, while it serves to facilitate the conquest
of every yet remaining difficulty, is of itself an interesting subject of study, and
a conclusive proof of that unity of character which marks the constitution of
the human faculties.
Proposition I.
5. To investigate the nature of the connexion of Secondary Propositions with
the idea of Time.
It is necessary, in entering upon this inquiry, to state clearly the nature of
the analogy which connects Secondary with Primary Propositions.
Primary Propositions express relations among things, viewed as component
parts of a universe within the limits of which, whether coextensive with the
limits of the actual universe or not, the matter of our discourse is confined.
The relations expressed are essentially substantive. Some, or all, or none, of the
members of a given class, are also members of another class. The subjects to
which primary propositions refer–the relations among those subjects which they
express–are all of the above character.
But in treating of secondary propositions, we find ourselves concerned with
another class both of subjects and relations. For the subjects with which we have
to do are themselves propositions, so that the question may be asked,–Can we
regard these subjects also as things, and refer them, by analogy with the previous
case, to a universe of their own? Again, the relations among these subject
propositions are relations of coexistent truth or falsehood, not of substantive
equivalence. We do not say, when expressing the connexion of two distinct
propositions, that the one is the other, but use some such forms of speech as
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 127
the following, according to the meaning which we desire to convey: “Either the
proposition X is true, or the proposition Y is true;” “If the proposition X is
true, the proposition Y is true;” “The propositions X and Y are jointly true;”
and so on.
Now, in considering any such relations as the above, we are not called upon
to inquire into the whole extent of their possible meaning (for this might involve
us in metaphysical questions of causation, which are beyond the proper limits of
science); but it suffices to ascertain some meaning which they undoubtedly possess,
and which is adequate for the purposes of logical deduction. Let us take,
as an instance for examination, the conditional proposition, “If the proposition
X is true, the proposition Y is true.” An undoubted meaning of this proposition
is, that the time in which the proposition X is true, is time in which the
proposition Y is true. This indeed is only a relation of coexistence, and may
or may not exhaust the meaning of the proposition, but it is a relation really
involved in the statement of the proposition, and further, it suffices for all the
purposes of logical inference.
The language of common life sanctions this view of the essential connexion
of secondary propositions with the notion of time. Thus we limit the application
of a primary proposition by the word “some,” but that of a secondary proposition
by the word “sometimes.” To say, “Sometimes injustice triumphs,” is
equivalent to asserting that there are times in which the proposition “Injustice
now triumphs,” is a true proposition. There are indeed propositions, the truth
of which is not thus limited to particular periods or conjunctures; propositions
which are true throughout all time, and have received the appellation of “eternal
truths.” The distinction must be familiar to every reader of Plato and Aristotle,
by the latter of whom, especially, it is employed to denote the contrast between
the abstract verities of science, such as the propositions of geometry which are
always true, and those contingent or phænomenal relations of things which are
sometimes true and sometimes false. But the forms of language in which both
kinds of propositions are expressed manifest a common dependence upon the
idea of time; in the one case as limited to some finite duration, in the other as
stretched out to eternity.
6. It may indeed be said, that in ordinary reasoning we are often quite
unconscious of this notion of time involved in the very language we are using.
But the remark, however just, only serves to show that we commonly reason by
the aid of words and the forms of a well-constructed language, without attending
to the ulterior grounds upon which those very forms have been established. The
course of the present investigation will afford an illustration of the very same
principle. I shall avail myself of the notion of time in order to determine the laws
of the expression of secondary propositions, as well as the laws of combination
of the symbols by which they are expressed. But when those laws and those
forms are once determined, this notion of time (essential, as I believe it to be,
to the above end) may practically be dispensed with. We may then pass from
the forms of common language to the closely analogous forms of the symbolical
instrument of thought here developed, and use its processes, and interpret its
results, without any conscious recognition of the idea of time whatever.
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 128
Proposition II.
7. To establish a system of notation for the expression of Secondary Propositions,
and to show that the symbols which it involves are subject to the same
laws of combination as the corresponding symbols employed in the expression of
Primary Propositions.
Let us employ the capital letters X, Y , Z, to denote the elementary propositions
concerning which we desire to make some assertion touching their truth
or falsehood, or among which we seek to express some relation in the form of
a secondary proposition. And let us employ the corresponding small letters x,
y, z, considered as expressive of mental operations, in the following sense, viz.:
Let x represent an act of the mind by which we fix our regard upon that portion
of time for which the proposition X is true; and let this meaning be understood
when it is asserted that x denotes the time for which the proposition X is true.
Let us further employ the connecting signs +, -, =, &c., in the following sense,
viz.: Let x + y denote the aggregate of those portions of time for which the
propositions X and Y are respectively true, those times being entirely separated
from each other. Similarly let x - y denote that remainder of time which
is left when we take away from the portion of time for which X is true, that
(by supposition) included portion for which Y is true. Also, let x = y denote
that the time for which the proposition X is true, is identical with the time for
which the proposition Y is true. We shall term x; the representative symbol of
the proposition X, &c.
From the above definitions it will follow, that we shall always have
x + y = y + x,
for either member will denote the same aggregate of time.
Let us further represent by xy the performance in succession of the two operations
represented by y and x, i.e. the whole mental operation which consists
of the following elements, viz., 1st, The mental selection of that portion of time
for which the proposition Y is true. 2ndly, The mental selection, out of that
portion of time, of such portion as it contains of the time in which the proposition
X is true,–the result of these successive processes being the fixing of the
mental regard upon the whole of that portion of time for which the propositions
X and Y are both true.
From this definition it will follow, that we shall always have
xy = yx. (1)
For whether we select mentally, first that portion of time for which the
proposition Y is true, then out of the result that contained portion for which X
is true; or first, that portion of time for which the proposition X is true, then
out of the result that contained portion of it for which the proposition Y is true;
we shall arrive at the same final result, viz., that portion of time for which the
propositions X and Y are both true.
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 129
By continuing this method of reasoning it may be established, that the laws
of combination of the symbols x, y, z, &c., in the species of interpretation here
assigned to them, are identical in expression with the laws of combination of
the same symbols, in the interpretation assigned to them in the first part of this
treatise. The reason of this final identity is apparent. For in both cases it is
the same faculty, or the same combination of faculties, of which we study the
operations; operations, the essential character of which is unaffected, whether we
suppose them to be engaged upon that universe of things in which all existence
is contained, or upon that whole of time in which all events are realized, and to
some part, at least, of which all assertions, truths, and propositions, refer.
Thus, in addition to the laws above stated, we shall have by (4), Chap, II.,
the law whose expression is
x(y + z) = xy + xz; (2)
and more particularly the fundamental law of duality (2) Chap, II., whose
expression is
x
2 = x, or, x(1 - x) = 0; (3)
a law, which while it serves to distinguish the system of thought in Logic
from the system of thought in the science of quantity, gives to the processes
of the former a completeness and a generality which they could not otherwise
possess.
8. Again, as this law (3) (as well as the other laws) is satisfied by the
symbols 0 and 1, we are led, as before, to inquire whether those symbols do not
admit of interpretation in the present system of thought. The same course of
reasoning which we before pursued shows that they do, and warrants us in the
two following positions, viz.:
1st, That in the expression of secondary propositions, 0 represents nothing
in reference to the element of time.
2nd, That in the same system 1 represents the universe, or whole of time,
to which the discourse is supposed in any manner to relate.
As in primary propositions the universe of discourse is sometimes limited to
a small portion of the actual universe of things, and is sometimes co-extensive
with that universe; so in secondary propositions, the universe of discourse may
be limited to a single day or to the passing moment, or it may comprise the whole
duration of time. It may, in the most literal sense, be “eternal.” Indeed, unless
there is some limitation expressed or implied in the nature of the discourse, the
proper interpretation of the symbol 1 in secondary propositions is “eternity;”
even as its proper interpretation in the primary system is the actually existent
universe.
9. Instead of appropriating the symbols x, y, z, to the representation of the
truths of propositions, we might with equal propriety apply them to represent
the occurrence of events. In fact, the occurrence of an event both implies, and
is implied by, the truth of a proposition, viz., of the proposition which asserts
the occurrence of the event. The one signification of the symbol x necessarily
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 130
involves the other. It will greatly conduce to convenience to be able to employ
our symbols in either of these really equivalent interpretations which the
circumstances of a problem may suggest to us as most desirable; and of this liberty
I shall avail myself whenever occasion requires. In problems of pure Logic
I shall consider the symbols x, y, &c. as representing elementary propositions,
among which relation is expressed in the premises. In the mathematical theory
of probabilities, which, as before intimated (I. 12), rests upon a basis of Logic,
and which it is designed to treat in a subsequent portion of this work, I shall
employ the same symbols to denote the simple events, whose implied or required
frequency of occurrence it counts among its elements.
Proposition III.
10. To deduce general Rules for the expression of Secondary Propositions.
In the various inquiries arising out of this Proposition, fulness of demonstration
will be the less necessary, because of the exact analogy which they bear
with similar inquiries already completed with reference to primary propositions.
We shall first consider the expression of terms; secondly, that of the propositions
by which they are connected.
As 1 denotes the whole duration of time, and x that portion of it for which
the proposition X is true, 1 - x will denote that portion of time for which the
proposition X is false.
Again, as xy denotes that portion of time for which the propositions X and
Y are both true, we shall, by combining this and the previous observation, be
led to the following interpretations, viz.:
The expression x(1-y) will represent the time during which the proposition
X is true, and the proposition Y false. The expression (1 - x)(1 - y) will
represent the time during which the propositions X and Y are simultaneously
false.
The expression x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) will express the time during which either
X is true or Y true, but not both; for that time is the sum of the times in which
they are singly and exclusively true. The expression xy + (1 - x)(1 - y) will
express the time during which X and Y are either both true or both false.
If another symbol z presents itself, the same principles remain applicable.
Thus xyz denotes the time in which the propositions X, Y , and Z are simultaneously
true; (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) the time in which they are simultaneously
false; and the sum of these expressions would denote the time in which they are
either true or false together.
The general principles of interpretation involved in the above examples do
not need any further illustrations or more explicit statement.
11. The laws of the expression of propositions may now be exhibited and
studied in the distinct cases in which they present themselves. There is, however,
one principle of fundamental importance to which I wish in the first place
to direct attention. Although the principles of expression which have been laid
down are perfectly general, and enable us to limit our assertions of the truth
or falsehood of propositions to any particular portions of that whole of time
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 131
(whether it be an unlimited eternity, or a period whose beginning and whose
end are definitely fixed, or the passing moment) which constitutes the universe
of our discourse, yet, in the actual procedure of human reasoning, such limitation
is not commonly employed. When we assert that a proposition is true,
we generally mean that it is true throughout the whole duration of the time to
which our discourse refers; and when different assertions of the unconditional
truth or falsehood of propositions are jointly made as the premises of a logical
demonstration, it is to the same universe of time that those assertions are referred,
and not to particular and limited parts of it. In that necessary matter
which is the object or field of the exact sciences every assertion of a truth may
be the assertion of an “eternal truth.” In reasoning upon transient phænomena
(as of some social conjuncture) each assertion may be qualified by an immediate
reference to the present time, “Now.” But in both cases, unless there is a distinct
expression to the contrary, it is to the same period of duration that each
separate proposition relates. The cases which then arise for our consideration
are the following:
1st. To express the Proposition, “The proposition X is true.”
We are here required to express that within those limits of time to which
the matter of our discourse is confined the proposition X is true. Now the time
for which the proposition X is true is denoted by x, and the extent of time to
which our discourse refers is represented by 1. Hence we have
x = 1 (4)
as the expression required.
2nd. To express the Proposition, “The proposition X is false.”
We are here to express that within the limits of time to which our discourse
relates, the proposition X is false; or that within those limits there is no portion
of time for which it is true. Now the portion of time for which it is true is x.
Hence the required equation will be
x = 0. (5)
This result might also be obtained by equating to the whole duration of time
1, the expression for the time during which the proposition X is false, viz., 1-x.
This gives
1 - x = 1,
whence x = 0.
3rd. To express the disjunctive Proposition, “Either the proposition X is true
or the proposition Y is true;” it being thereby implied that the said propositions
are mutually exclusive, that is to say, that one only of them is true.
The time for which either the proposition X is true or the proposition Y is
true, but not both, is represented by the expression x(1 - y) + y(1 - x). Hence
we have
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 132
x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = 1, (6)
for the equation required.
If in the above Proposition the particles either, or, are supposed not to possess
an absolutely disjunctive power, so that the possibility of the simultaneous
truth of the propositions X and Y is not excluded, we must add to the first
member of the above equations the term xy. We shall thus have
xy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = 1,
or x + (1 - x)y = 1. (7)
4th. To express the conditional Proposition, “If the proposition Y is true,
the proposition X is true.”
Since whenever the proposition Y is true, the proposition X is true, it is
necessary and sufficient here to express, that the time in which the proposition
Y is true is time in which the proposition X is true; that is to say, that it is
some indefinite portion of the whole time in which the proposition X is true.
Now the time in which the proposition Y is true is y, and the whole time in
which the proposition X is true is x. Let v be a symbol of time indefinite, then
will vx represent an indefinite portion of the whole time x. Accordingly, we
shall have
y = vx
as the expression of the proposition given.
12. When v is thus regarded as a symbol of time indefinite, vx may be
understood to represent the whole, or an indefinite part, or no part, of the
whole time x; for any one of these meanings may be realized by a particular
determination of the arbitrary symbol v. Thus, if v be determined to represent
a time in which the whole time x is included, vx will represent the whole time
x. If v be determined to represent a time, some part of which is included in the
time x, but which does not fill up the measure of that time, vx will represent a
part of the time x. If, lastly, v is determined to represent a time, of which no
part is common with any part of the time x, vx will assume the value 0, and
will be equivalent to “no time,” or “never.”
Now it is to be observed that the proposition, “If Y is true, X is true,”
contains no assertion of the truth of either of the propositions X and Y . It
may equally consist with the supposition that the truth of the proposition Y is
a condition indispensable to the truth of the proposition X, in which case we
shall have v = 1; or with the supposition that although Y expresses a condition
which, when realized, assures us of the truth of X, yet X may be true without
implying the fulfilment of that condition, in which case v denotes a time, some
part of which is contained in the whole time x; or, lastly, with the supposition
that the proposition Y is not true at all, in which case v represents some time,
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 133
no part of which is common with any part of the time x. All these cases are
involved in the general supposition that v is a symbol of time indefinite.
5th. To express a proposition in which the conditional and the disjunctive
characters both exist.
The general form of a conditional proposition is, “If Y is true, X is true,”
and its expression is, by the last section, y = vx. We may properly, in analogy
with the usage which has been established in primary propositions, designate
Y and X as the terms of the conditional proposition into which they enter; and
we may further adopt the language of the ordinary Logic, which designates the
term Y , to which the particle if is attached, the “antecedent” of the proposition,
and the term X the “consequent.”
Now instead of the terms, as in the above case, being simple propositions,
let each or either of them be a disjunctive proposition involving different terms
connected by the particles either, or, as in the following illustrative examples,
in which X, Y , Z, &c. denote simple propositions.
1st. If either X is true or Y is true, then Z is true.
2nd. If X is true, then either Y is true or Z true.
3rd. If either X is true or Y is true, then either Z and W are both true, or
they are both false.
It is evident that in the above cases the relation of the antecedent to the
consequent is not affected by the circumstance that one of those terms or both
are of a disjunctive character. Accordingly it is only necessary to obtain, in
conformity with the principles already established, the proper expressions for
the antecedent and the consequent, to affect the latter with the indefinite symbol
v, and to equate the results. Thus for the propositions above stated we shall
have the respective equations,
1st x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = vz.
2nd.x = v{y(1 - z) + z(1 - y)}.
3rd.x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = v{zw + (1 - z)(1 - w)}
The rule here exemplified is of general application.
Cases in which the disjunctive and the conditional elements enter in a manner
different from the above into the expression of a compound proposition, are
conceivable, but I am not aware that they are ever presented to us by the natural
exigencies of human reason, and I shall therefore refrain from any discussion of
them. No serious difficulty will arise from this omission, as the general principles
which have formed the basis of the above applications are perfectly general, and
a slight effort of thought will adapt them to any imaginable case.
13. In the laws of expression above stated those of interpretation are implicitly
involved. The equation
x = 1
must be understood to express that the proposition X is true; the equation
x = 0,
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 134
that the proposition X is false. The equation
xy = 1
will express that the propositions X and Y are both true together; and the
equation
xy = 0
that they are not both together true.
In like manner the equations
x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = 1,
x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = 0,
will respectively assert the truth and the falsehood of the disjunctive Proposition,
“Either X is true or Y is true.” The equations
y = vx
y = v(1 - x)
will respectively express the Propositions, “If the proposition Y is true, the
proposition X is true.” “If the proposition Y is true, the proposition X is false.”
Examples will frequently present themselves, in the succeeding chapters of
this work, of a case in which some terms of a particular member of an equation
are affected by the indefinite symbol v, and others not so affected. The following
instance will serve for illustration. Suppose that we have
y = xz + vx(1 - z).
Here it is implied that the time for which the proposition Y is true consists
of all the time for which X and Z are together true, together with an indefinite
portion of the time for which X is true and Z false. From this it may be seen,
1st, That if Y is true, either X and Z are together true, or X is true and Z
false; 2ndly, If X and Z are together true, Y is true. The latter of these may
be called the reverse interpretation, and it consists in taking the antecedent
out of the second member, and the consequent from the first member of the
equation. The existence of a term in the second member, whose coefficient is
unity, renders this latter mode of interpretation possible. The general principle
which it involves may be thus stated:
14. Principle.–Any constituent term or terms in a particular member of an
equation which have for their coefficient unity, may be taken as the antecedent of
a proposition, of which all the terms in the other member form the consequent.
Thus the equation
y = xz + vx(1 - z) + (1 - x)(1 - z)
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 135
would have the following interpretations:
Direct Interpretation.–If the proposition Y is true, then either X and
Z are true, or X is true and Z false, or X and Z are both false.
Reverse Interpretation.–If either X and Z are true, or X and Z are
false, Y is true.
The aggregate of these partial interpretations will express the whole signifi-
cance of the equation given.
15. We may here call attention again to the remark, that although the idea
of time appears to be an essential element in the theory of the interpretation
of secondary propositions, it may practically be neglected as soon as the laws
of expression and of interpretation are definitely established. The forms to
which those laws give rise seem, indeed, to correspond with the forms of a
perfect language. Let us imagine any known or existing language freed from
idioms and divested of superfluity, and let us express in that language any given
proposition in a manner the most simple and literal,–the most in accordance
with those principles of pure and universal thought upon which all languages
are founded, of which all bear the manifestation, but from which all have more
or less departed. The transition from such a language to the notation of analysis
would consist of no more than the substitution of one set of signs for another,
without essential change either of form or character. For the elements, whether
things or propositions, among which relation is expressed, we should substitute
letters; for the disjunctive conjunction we should write +; for the connecting
copula or sign of relatioin, we should write =. This analogy I need not pursue.
Its reality and completeness will be made more apparent from the study of those
forms of expression which will present themselves in subsequent applications of
the present theory, viewed in more immediate comparison with that imperfect
yet noble instrument of thought–the English language.
16. Upon the general analogy between the theory of Primary and that of
Secondary Propositions, I am desirous of adding a few remarks before dismissing
the subject of the present chapter.
We might undoubtedly, have established the theory of Primary Propositions
upon the simple notion of space, in the same way as that of secondary propositions
has been established upon the notion of time. Perhaps, had this been
done, the analogy which we are contemplating would have been in somewhat
closer accordance with the view of those who regard space and time as merely
“forms of the human understanding,” conditions of knowledge imposed by the
very constitution of the mind upon all that is submitted to its apprehension.
But this view, while on the one hand it is incapable of demonstration, on the
other hand ties us down to the recognition of “place,” t? p???, as an essential
category of existence. The question, indeed, whether it is so or not, lies, I apprehend,
beyond the reach of our faculties; but it may be, and I conceive has
been, established, that the formal processes of reasoning in primary propositions
do not require, as an essential condition, the manifestation in space of the
things about which we reason; that they would remain applicable, with equal
strictness of demonstration, to forms of existence, if such there be, which lie
beyond the realm of sensible extension. It is a fact, perhaps, in some degree
CHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 136
analogous to this, that we are able in many known examples in geometry and
dynamics, to exhibit the formal analysis of problems founded upon some intellectual
conception of space different from that which is presented to us by the
senses, or which can be realized by the imagination. 1
I conceive, therefore,
that the idea of space is not essential to the development of a theory of primary
propositions, but am disposed, though desiring to speak with diffidence upon
a question of such extreme difficulty, to think that the idea of time is essential
to the establishment of a theory of secondary propositions. There seem to
be grounds for thinking, that without any change in those faculties which are
concerned in reasoning, the manifestation of space to the human mind might
have been different from what it is, but not (at least the same) grounds for
supposing that the manifestation of time could have been otherwise than we
perceive it to be. Dismissing, however, these speculations as possibly not altogether
free from presumption, let it be affirmed that the real ground upon
which the symbol 1 represents in primary propositions the universe of things,
and not the space they occupy, is, that the sign of identity = connecting the
members of the corresponding equations, implies that the things which they
represent are identical, not simply that they are found in the same portion of
space. Let it in like manner be affirmed, that the reason why the symbol 1 in
secondary propositions represents, not the universe of events, but the eternity
in whose successive moments and periods they are evolved, is, that the same
sign of identity connecting the logical members of the corresponding equations
implies, not that the events which those members represent are identical, but
that the times of their occurrence are the same. These reasons appear to me
to be decisive of the immediate question of interpretation. In a former treatise
on this subject (Mathematical Analysis of Logic, p. 49), following the theory
of Wallis respecting the Reduction of Hypothetical Propositions, I was led to
interpret the symbol 1 in secondary propositions as the universe of “cases” or
“conjunctures of circumstances;” but this view involves the necessity of a defi-
nition of what is meant by a “case,” or “conjuncture of circumstances;” and it
is certain, that whatever is involved in the term beyond the notion of time is
alien to the objects, and restrictive of the processes, of formal Logic.
1Space is presented to us in perception, as possessing the three dimensions of length,
breadth, and depth. But in a large class of problems relating to the properties of curved
surfaces, the rotations of solid bodies around axes, the vibrations of elastic media, &c., this
limitation appears in the analytical investigation to be of an arbitrary character, and if attention
were paid to the processes of solution alone, no reason could be discovered why space
should not exist in four or in any greater number of dimensions. The intellectual procedure
in the imaginary world thus suggested can be apprehended by the clearest light of analogy.
The existence of space in three dimensions, and the views thereupon of the religious and
philosophical mind of antiquity, are thus set forth by Aristotle:– ?e????? d? t? µ?? ?f ¨e?,

Chapter XII
OF THE METHODS AND PROCESSES TO BE
ADOPTED IN THE TREATMENT OF SECONDARY
PROPOSITIONS.
1. It has appeared from previous researches (XI. 7) that the laws of combination
of the literal symbols of Logic are the same, whether those symbols are
employed in the expression of primary or in that of secondary propositions, the
sole existing difference between the two cases being a difference of interpretation.
It has also been established (V. 6), that whenever distinct systems of thought
and interpretation are connected with the same system of formal laws, i.e., of
laws relating to the combination and use of symbols, the attendant processes,
intermediate between the expression of the primary conditions of a problem and
the interpretation of its symbolical solution, are the same in both. Hence, as
between the systems of thought manifested in the two forms of primary and
of secondary propositions, this community of formal law exists, the processes
which have been established and illustrated in our discussion of the former class
of propositions will, without any modification, be applicable to the latter.
2. Thus the laws of the two fundamental processes of elimination and development
are the same in the system of secondary as in the system of primary
propositions. Again, it has been seen (Chap. VI. Prop. 2) how, in primary
propositions, the interpretation of any proposed equation devoid of fractional
forms may be effected by developing it into a series of constituents, and equating
to 0 every constituent whose coefficient does not vanish. To the equations
of secondary propositions the same method is applicable, and the interpreted
result to which it finally conducts us is, as in the former case (VI. 6), a system
of co-existent denials. But while in the former case the force of those denials is
expended upon the existence of certain classes of things, in the latter it relates
to the truth of certain combinations of the elementary propositions involved in
the terms of the given premises. And as in primary propositions it was seen
that the system of denials admitted of conversion into various other forms of
propositions (VI. 7), &c., such conversion will be found to be possible here also,
the sole difference consisting not in the forms of the equations, but in the nature
of their interpretation.
3. Moreover, as in primary propositions, we can find the expression of any
137
CHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 138
element entering into a system of equations, in terms of the remaining elements
(VI. 10), or of any selected number of the remaining elements, and interpret
that expression into a logical inference, the same object can be accomplished
by the same means, difference of interpretation alone excepted, in the system of
secondary propositions. The elimination of those elements which we desire to
banish from the final solution, the reduction of the system to a single equation,
the algebraic solution and the mode of its development into an interpretable
form, differ in no respect from the corresponding steps in the discussion of
primary propositions.
To remove, however, any possible difficulty, it may be desirable to collect under
a general Rule the different cases which present themselves in the treatment
of secondary propositions.
Rule.–Express symbolically the given propositions (XI. 11).
Eliminate separately from each equation in which it is found the indefinite
symbol v (VII. 5).
Eliminate the remaining symbols which it is desired to banish from the final
solution: always before elimination ’reducing to a single equation those equations
in which the symbol or symbols to be eliminated are found (VIII. 7). Collect the
resulting equations into a single equation V = 0.
Then proceed according to the particular form in which it is desired to express
the final relation, as–
1st. If in the form of a denial, or system of denials, develop the function V ,
and equate to 0 all those constituents whose coefficients do not vanish.
2ndly. If in the form of a disjunctive proposition, equate to 1 the sum of
those constituents whose coefficients vanish.
3rdly. If in the form of a conditional proposition having a simple element, as
x or 1-x, for its antecedent, determine the algebraic expression of that element,
and develop that expression.
4thly. If in the form of a conditional proposition having a compound expression,
as xy, xy + (1 - x)(1 - y), &c., for its antecedent, equate that expression
to a new symbol t, and determine t as a developed function of the symbols which
are to appear in the consequent, either by ordinary methods or by the special
method (IX. 9).
5thly. Interpret the results by (XI. 13, 14).
If it only be desired to ascertain whether a particular elementary proposition
x is true or false, we must eliminate all the symbols but x; then the equation
x = 1 will indicate that the proposition is true, x = 0 that it is false, 0 = 0 that
the premises are insufficient to determine whether it is true or false.
4. Ex. 1.–The following prediction is made the subject of a curious discussion
in Cicero’s fragmentary treatise, De Fato:–“Si quis (Fabius) natus est oriente
Canicula, is in mari non morietur.” I shall apply to it the method of this chapter.
Let y represent the proposition, “Fabius was born at the rising of the dogstar;”
x the proposition, “Fabius will die in the sea.” In saying that x represents the
proposition, “Fabius, &c.,” it is only meant that x is a symbol so appropriated
(XI. 7) to the above proposition, that the equation x = 1 declares, and the
equation x = 0 denies, the truth of that proposition. The equation we have to
CHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 139
discuss will be
y = v(1 - x). (1)
And, first, let it be required to reduce the given proposition to a negation or
system of negations (XII. 3). We have, on transposition,
y - v(1 - x) = 0.
Eliminating v,
y {y - (1 - x)} = 0,
or, y - y(1 - x) = 0,
or, yx = 0. (2)
The interpretation of this result is:–“It is not true that Fabius was born at
the rising of the dogstar, and will die in the sea.” Cicero terms this form of
proposition, “Conjunctio ex repugnantibus;” and he remarks that Chrysippus
thought in this way to evade the difficulty which he imagined to exist in contingent
assertions respecting the future: “Hoc loco Chrysippus aestuans falli
sperat Chaldaeos casterosque divinos, neque eos usuros esse conjunctionibus ut
ita sua percepta pronuntient: Si quis natus est oriente Canicula is in mari non
morietur; sed potius ita dicant: Non et natus est quis oriente Caniculˆa, et in
mari morietur. O licentiam jocularem! ... Multa genera sunt enuntiandi, nec ullum
distortius quam hoc quo Chrysippus sperat Chaldaeos contentos Stoicorum
causa fore.”–Cic. De Fato, 7, 8.
5. To reduce the given proposition to a disjunctive form. The constituents
not entering into the first member of (2) are
x(1 - y),(1 - x)y,(1 - x)(1 - y).
Whence we have
y(1 - x) + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)(1 - y) = 1. (3)
The interpretation of which is:–Either Fabius was born at the rising of the
dogstar, and will not perish in the sea; or he was not born at the rising of
the dogstar, and will perish in the sea; or he was not born at the rising of the
dogstar, and will not perish in the sea.
In cases like the above, however, in which there exist constituents differing
from each other only by a single factor, it is, as we have seen (VII. 15), most
convenient to collect such constituents into a single term. If we thus connect
the first and third terms of (3), we have
(1 - y)x + 1 - x = 1;
and if we similarly connect the second and third, we have
y(1 - x) + 1 - y = 1.
CHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 140
These forms of the equation severally give the interpretations–
Either Fabius was not born under the day star, and will die in the sea, or he
will not die in the sea.
Either Fabius was born under the day star, and will not die in the sea, or he
was not born under the dogstar.
It is evident that these interpretations are strictly equivalent to the former
one.
Let us ascertain, in the form of a conditional proposition, the consequences
which flow from the hypothesis, that “Fabius will perish in the sea.”
In the equation (2), which expresses the result of the elimination of v from
the original equation, we must seek to determine x as a function of y.
We have
x =
0
y
= 0y +
0
0
(1 - y) on expansion,
or
x =
0
0
(1 - y);
the interpretation of which is,–If Fabius shall die in the sea, he was not born at
the rising of the dogstar.
These examples serve in some measure to illustrate the connexion which
has been established in the previous sections between primary and secondary
propositions, a connexion of which the two distinguishing features are identity
of process and analogy of interpretation.
6. Ex. 2.–There is a remarkable argument in the second book of the Republic
of Plato, the design of which is to prove the immutability of the Divine Nature.
It is a very fine example both of the careful induction from familiar instances by
which Plato arrives at general principles, and of the clear and connected logic
by which he deduces from them the particular inferences which it is his object
to establish. The argument is contained in the following dialogue:
“Must not that which departs from its proper form be changed either by itself
or by another thing? Necessarily so. Are not things which are in the best state
least changed and disturbed, as the body by meats and drinks, and labours,
and every species of plant by heats and winds, and such like affections? Is not
the healthiest and strongest the least changed? Assuredly. And does not any
trouble from without least disturb and change that soul which is strongest and
wisest? And as to all made vessels, and furnitures, and garments, according
to the same principle, are not those which are well wrought, and in a good
condition, least changed by time and other accidents? Even so. And whatever
is in a right state, either by nature or by art, or by both these, admits of the
smallest change from any other thing. So it seems. But God and things divine
are in every sense in the best state. Assuredly. In this way, then, God should
least of all bear many forms? Least, indeed, of all. Again, should He transform
and change Himself? Manifestly He must do so, if He is changed at all. Changes
He then Himself to that which is more good and fair, or to that which is worse
and baser? Necessarily to the worse, if he be changed. For never shall we say
that God is indigent of beauty or of virtue. You speak most rightly, said I, and
CHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 141
the matter being so, seems it to you, O Adimantus, that God or man willingly
makes himself in any sense worse? Impossible, said he. Impossible, then, it is,
said I, that a god should wish to change himself; but ever being fairest and best,
each of them ever remains absolutely in the same form.”
The premises of the above argument are the following:
1st. If the Deity suffers change, He is changed either by Himself or by
another.
2nd. If He is in the best state, He is not changed by another.
3rd. The Deity is in the best state.
4th. If the Deity is changed by Himself, He is changed to a worse state.
5th. If He acts willingly, He is not changed to a worse state.
6th. The Deity acts willingly.
Let us express the elements of these premises as follows:
Let x represent the proposition, “The Deity suffers change.”
y, He is changed by Himself.
z, He is changed by another.
s, He is in the best state.
t, He is changed to a worse state.
w, He acts willingly.
Then the premises expressed in symbolical language yield, after elimination
of the indefinite class symbols v, the following equations:
xyz + x(1 - y)(1 - z) = 0, (1)
sz = 0, (2)
s = 1, (3)
y(1 - t) = 0, (4)
wt = 0, (5)
w = 1. (6)
Retaining x, I shall eliminate in succession z, s, y, t, and w (this being the
order in which those symbols occur in the above system), and interpret the
successive results.
Eliminating z from (1) and (2), we get
xs(1 - y) = 0. (7)
Eliminating s from (3) and (7),
x(1 - y) = 0. (8)
Eliminating y from (4) and (8),
x(1 - t) = 0. (9)
Eliminating t from (5) and (9),
xw = 0. (10)
CHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 142
Eliminating w from (6) and (10),
x = 0. (11)
These equations, beginning with (8), give the following results:
From (8) we have x =
0
0
y, therefore, If the Deity suffers change, He is
changed by Himself.
From (9), x =
0
0
t, If the Deity suffers change, He is changed to a worse
state.
From (10), x =
0
0
(1 - w). If the Deity suffers change, He does not act
willingly.
From (11), The Deity does not suffer change. This is Plato’s result.
Now I have before remarked, that the order of elimination is indifferent. Let
us in the present case seek to verify this fact by eliminating the same symbols
in a reverse order, beginning with w. The resulting equations are,
t = 0, y = 0, x(1 - x) = 0, z = 0, x = 0;
yielding the following interpretations:
God is not changed to a worse state. He is not changed by Himself. If He
suffers change, He is changed by another. He is not changed by another. He is
not changed.
We thus reach by a different route the same conclusion.
Though as an exhibition of the power of the method, the above examples
are of slight value, they serve as well as more complicated instances would do,
to illustrate its nature and character.
7. It may be remarked, as a final instance of analogy between the system of
primary and that of secondary propositions, that in the latter system also the
fundamental equation,
x(1 - x) = 0,
admits of interpretation. It expresses the axiom, A proposition cannot at the
same time be true and false. Let this be compared with the corresponding
interpretation (III. 15). Solved under the form
x =
0
1 - x
=
0
0
x,
by development, it furnishes the respective axioms: “A thing is what it is:” “If
a proposition is true, it is true:” forms of what has been termed “The principle
of identity.” Upon the nature and the value of these axioms the most opposite
opinions have been entertained. Some have regarded them as the very pith and
marrow of philosophy. Locke devoted to them a chapter, headed, “On Trifling
Propositions.” 1
In both these views there seems to have been a mixture of
truth and error. Regarded as supplanting experience, or as furnishing materials
for the vain and wordy janglings of the schools, such propositions are worse than
trifling. Viewed, on the other hand, as intimately allied with the very laws and
conditions of thought, they rise into at least a speculative importance.

ANALYSIS OF A PORTION OF DR. SAMUEL
CLARKE’s “DEMONSTRATION OF THE BEING AND
ATTRIBUTES OF GOD,” AND OF A PORTION OF
THE “ETHICA ORDINE GEOMETRICO
DEMONSTRATA” OF SPINOZA.
1. The general order which, in the investigations of the following chapter,
I design to pursue, is the following. I shall examine what are the actual
premises involved in the demonstrations of some of the general propositions
of the above treatises, whether those premises be expressed or implied. By the
actual premises I mean whatever propositions are assumed in the course of the
argument, without being proved, and are employed as parts of the foundation
upon which the final conclusion is built. The premises thus determined, I shall
express in the language of symbols, and I shall then deduce from them by the
methods developed in the previous chapters of this work, the most important
inferences which they involve, in addition to the particular inferences actually
drawn by the authors. I shall in some instances modify the premises by the omission
of some fact or principle which is contained in them, or by the addition or
substitution of some new proposition, and shall determine how by such change
the ultimate conclusions are affected. In the pursuit of these objects it will not
devolve upon me to inquire, except incidentally, how far the metaphysical principles
laid down in these celebrated productions are worthy of confidence, but
only to ascertain what conclusions may justly be drawn from given premises;
and in doing this, to exemplify the perfect liberty which we possess as concerns
both the choice and the order of the elements of the final or concluding propositions,
viz., as to determining what elementary propositions are true or false,
and what are true or false under given restrictions, or in given combinations.
2. The chief practical difficulty of this inquiry will consist, not in the application
of the method to the premises once determined, but in ascertaining
what the premises are. In what area regarded as the most rigorous examples of
reasoning applied to metaphysical questions, it will occasionally be found that
different trains of thought are blended together; that particular but essential
parts of the demonstration are given parenthetically, or out of the main course
143
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 144
of the argument; that the meaning of a premiss may be in some degree ambiguous;
and, not unfrequently, that arguments, viewed by the strict laws of
formal reasoning, are incorrect or inconclusive. The difficulty of determining
and distinctly exhibiting the true premises of a demonstration may,
in such cases, be very considerable. But it is a difficulty which must be
overcome by all who would ascertain whether a particular conclusion is proved
or not, whatever form they may be prepared or disposed to give to the ulterior
process of reasoning. It is a difficulty, therefore, which is not peculiar to the
method of this work, though it manifests itself more distinctly in connexion with
this method than with any other. So intimate, indeed, is this connexion, that it
is impossible, employing the method of this treatise, to form even a conjecture
as to the validity of a conclusion, without a distinct apprehension and exact
statement of all the premises upon which it rests. In the more usual course
of procedure, nothing is, however, more common than to examine some of the
steps of a train of argument, and thence to form a vague general impression of
the scope of the whole, without any such preliminary and thorough analysis of
the premises which it involves.
The necessity of a rigorous determination of the real premises of a demonstration
ought not to be regarded as an evil; especially as, when that task is
accomplished, every source doubt or ambiguity is removed. In employing the
method of this treatise, the order in which premises are arranged, the mode of
connexion which they exhibit, with every similar circumstance may be esteemed
a matter of indifference, and the process inference is conducted with a precision
which might almost termed mechanical.
3. The “Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God,” consists of a
series of propositions or theorems, each of them proved by means of premises
resolvable, for the most part, into two distinct classes, viz., facts of observation,
such as the existence of a material world, the phenomenon of motion, &c., and
hypothetical principles, the authority and universality of which are supposed
to be recognised `a priori. It is, of course, upon the truth of the latter, assuming
the correctness of the reasoning, that the validity of the demonstration
really depends. But whatever may be thought of its claims in this respect, it
is unquestionable that, as an intellectual performance, its merits are very high.
Though the trains of argument of which it consists are not in general very clearly
arranged, they are almost always specimens of correct Logic, and they exhibit
a subtlety of apprehension and a force of reasoning which have seldom been
equalled, never perhaps surpassed. We see in them the consummation of those
intellectual efforts which were awakened in the realm of metaphysical inquiry,
at a period when the dominion of hypothetical principles was less questioned
than it now is, and when the rigorous demonstrations of the newly risen school
of mathematical physics seemed to have furnished a model for their direction.
They appear to me for this reason (not to mention the dignity of the subject of
which they treat) to be deserving of high consideration; and I do not deem it a
vain or superfluous task to expend upon some of them a careful analysis.
4. The Ethics of Benedict Spinoza is a treatise, the object of which is to
prove the identity of God and the universe, and to establish, upon this doctrine,
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 145
a system of morals and of philosophy. The analysis of its main argument is
extremely difficult, owing not to the complexity of the separate propositions
which it involves, but to the use of vague definitions, and of axioms which,
through a like defect of clearness, it is perplexing to determine whether we
ought to accept or to reject. While the reasoning of Dr. Samuel Clarke is in
part verbal, that of Spinoza is so in a much greater degree; and perhaps this
is the reason why, to some minds, it has appeared to possess a formal cogency,
to which in reality it possesses no just claim. These points will, however, be
considered in the proper place.
clarke’s demonstration.
Proposition I.
5. “Something has existed from eternity.”
The proof is as follows:–
“For since something now is, ’tis manifest that something always was. Otherwise
the things that now are must have risen out of nothing, absolutely and
without cause. Which is a plain contradiction in terms. For to say a thing is
produced, and yet that there is no cause at all of that production, is to say that
something is effected when it is effected by nothing, that is, at the same time
when it is not effected at all. Whatever exists has a cause of its existence, either
in the necessity of its own nature, and thus it must have been of itself eternal:
or in the will of some other being, and then that other being must, at least in
the order of nature and causality, have existed before it.”
Let us now proceed to analyze the above demonstration. Its first sentence
is resolvable into the following propositions:
1st. Something is.
2nd. If something is, either something always was, or the things that now
are must have risen out of nothing.
The next portion of the demonstration consists of a proof that the second of
the above alternatives, viz., “The things that now are have risen out of nothing,”
is impossible, and it may formally be resolved as follows:
3rd. If the things that now are have risen out of nothing, something has been
effected, and at the same time that something has been effected by nothing.
4th. If that something has been effected by nothing, it has not been effected
at all.
The second portion of this argument appears to be a mere assumption of
the point to be proved, or an attempt to make that point clearer by a different
verbal statement.
The third and last portion of the demonstration contains a distinct proof
of the truth of either the original proposition to be proved, viz., “Something
always was,” or the point proved in the second part of the demonstration, viz.,
the untenable nature of the hypothesis, that “the things that now are have risen
out of nothing.” It is resolvable as follows:–
5th. If something is, either it exists by the necessity of its own nature, or it
exists by the will of another being.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 146
6th. If it exists by the necessity of its own nature, something always was.
7th. If it exists by the will of another being, then the proposition, that the
things which exist have arisen out of nothing, is false.
The last proposition is not expressed in the same form in the text of Dr.
Clarke; but his expressed conclusion of the prior existence of another Being is
clearly meant as equivalent to a denial of the proposition that the things which
now are have risen out of nothing.
It appears, therefore, that the demonstration consists of two distinct trains
of argument: one of those trains comprising what I have designated as the first
and second parts of the demonstration; the other comprising the first and third
parts. Let us consider the latter train.
The premises are:–
1st. Something is.
2nd. If something is, either something always was, or the things that now
are have risen out of nothing.
3rd. If something is, either it exists in the necessity of its own nature, or it
exists by the will of another being.
4th. If it exists in the necessity of its own nature, something always was.
5th. If it exists by the will of another being, then the hypothesis, that the
things which now are have risen out of nothing, is false.
We must now express symbolically the above proposition.
Let
x = Something is.
y = Something always was.
z = The things which now are have risen from nothing.
p = It exists in the necessity of its own nature
(i.e. the something spoken of above).
q = It exists by the will of another Being.
It must be understood, that by the expression, Let x = “Something is,” is
meant no more than that x is the representative symbol of that proposition (XI.
7), the equations x = 1, x = 0, respectively declaring its truth and its falsehood.
The equations of the premises are:–
1st. x = 1;
2nd. x = v[y(1 - x) + z(1 - y)];
3rd. x = v[p(1 - q) + q(1 - p)];
4th. p = vy;
5th. q = v(1 - z);
and on eliminating the several indefinite symbols v, we have
1 - x = 0; (1)
x[yz + (1 - y)(1 - z)] = 0; (2)
x[pq + (1 - p)(1 - q)] = 0; (3)
p(q - y) = 0; (4)
qz = 0. (5)
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 147
6. First, I shall examine whether any conclusions are deducible from the
above, concerning the truth or falsity of the single propositions represented by
the symbols y, z, p, q, viz., of the propositions, “Something always was;” “The
things which now are have risen from nothing;” “The something which is exists
by the necessity of its own nature;” “The something which is exists by the will
of another being.”
For this purpose we must separately eliminate all the symbols but y, all these
but z, &c. The resulting equation will determine whether any such separate
relations exist.
To eliminate x from (1), (2), and (3), it is only necessary to substitute in
(2) and (3) the value of x derived from (1). We find as the results,
yz + (1 - y)(1 - z) = 0. (6)
pq + (1 - p)(1 - q) = 0. (7)
To eliminate p we have from (4) and (7), by addition,
p(1 - y) + pq + (1 - p)(1 - q) = 0; (8)
whence we find,
(1 - y)(1 - q) = 0. (9)
To eliminate q from (5) and (9), we have
qz + (1 - y)(1 - q) = 0;
whence we find
x(1 - y) = 0. (10)
There now remain but the two equations (6) and (10), which, on addition,
give
yz + 1 - y = 0.
Eliminating from this equation z, we have
1 - y = 0, or, y = 1. (11)
Eliminating from the same equation y, we have
z = 0. (12)
The interpretation of (11) is
Something always was.
The interpretation of (12) is
The things which are have not risen from nothing.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 148
Next resuming the system (6), (7), with the two equations (4), (5), let us
determine the two equations involving p and q respectively.
To eliminate y we have from (4) and (6),
p(1 - y) + yz + (1 - y)(1 - z) = (0);
whence
(p + 1 - z)z = 0, or, pz = 0. (13)
To eliminate z from (5) and (13), we have
qz + pz = 0;
whence we get,
0 = 0.
There remains then but the equation (7), from which eliminating q, we have
0 = 0 for the final equation, in p.
Hence there is no conclusion derivable from the premises affirming the simple
truth or falsehood of the proposition, “The something which is exists in the
necessity of its own nature.” And as, on eliminating p, there is the same result,
0 = 0, for the ultimate equation in q, it also follows, that there is no conclusion
deducible from the premises as to the simple truth or falsehood of the proposition,
“The something which is exists by the will of another Being.”
Of relations connecting more than one of the propositions represented by the
elementary symbols, it is needless to consider any but that which is denoted by
the equation (7) connecting p and q, inasmuch as the propositions represented
by the remaining symbols are absolutely true or false independently of any
connexion of the kind here spoken of. The interpretation of (7), placed under
the form
p(1 - q) + q(1 - p) = 1, is,
The something which is, either exists in the necessity of its own nature, or
by the will of another being.
I have exhibited the details of the above analysis with a, perhaps, needless
fulness and prolixity, because in the examples which will follow, I propose rather
to indicate the steps by which results are obtained, than to incur the danger of
a wearisome frequency of repetition. The conclusions which have resulted from
the above application of the method are easily verified by ordinary reasoning.
The reader will have no difficulty in applying the method to the other train
of premises involved in Dr. Clarke’s first Proposition, and deducing from them
the two first of the conclusions to which the above analysis has led.
Proposition II.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 149
7. Some one unchangeable and independent Being has existed from eternity.
The premises from which the above proposition is prove are the following:
1st. Something has always existed.
2nd. If something has always existed, either there has existed some one
unchangeable and independent being, or the whole of existing things has been
comprehended in a succession of changeable and dependent beings.
3rd. If the universe has consisted of a succession of changeable and dependent
beings, either that series has had a cause from without, or it has had a cause
from within.
4th. It has not had a cause from without (because it includes, by hypothesis,
all things that exist).
5th. It has not had a cause from within (because no part is necessary, and
if no part is necessary, the whole cannot be necessary).
Omitting, merely for brevity, the subsidiary proofs contained in the parentheses
of the fourth and fifth premiss, we may represent the premises as follows:
Let x = Something has always existed.
y = There has existed some one unchangeable and independent being.
z = There has existed a succession of changeable and dependent beings.
p = That series has had a cause from without.
q = That series has had a cause from within.
Then we have the following system of equations, viz.:
1st. x = 1;
2nd. x = v{y(l - z) + z(1 - y)};
3rd. z = v{p(1 - q) + (1 - p)q};
4th. p = 0;
5th. q = 0 :
which, on the separate elimination of the indefinite symbols v, gives
l - x = 0; (1)
x{yz + (1 - y)(1 - z)} = 0; (2)
z{pq + (1 - p)(1 - q)} = 0; (3)
p = 0; (4)
q = 0. (5)
The elimination from the above system of x, p, q, and y, conducts to the
equation
z = 0.
And the elimination of x, p, q, and z, conducts in a similar manner to the
equation
y = 1.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 150
Of which equations the respective interpretations are:
1st. The whole of existing things has not been comprehended in a succession
of changeable and dependent beings.
2nd. There has existed some one unchangeable and independent being.
The latter of these is the proposition which Dr. Clarke proves. As, by the
above analysis, all the propositions represented by the literal symbols x, y, z,
p, q, are determined as absolutely true or false, it is needless to inquire into the
existence of any further relations connecting those propositions together.
Another proof is given of Prop. II., which for brevity I pass over. It may be
observed, that the “impossibility of infinite succession,” the proof of which forms
a part of Clarke’s argument, has commonly been assumed as a fundamental
principle of metaphysics, and extended to other questions than that of causation.
Aristotle applies it to establish the necessity of first principles of demonstration;
1
the necessity of an end (the good), in human actions, &c. 2 There is, perhaps,
no principle more frequently referred to in his writings. By the schoolmen it
was similarly applied to prove the impossibility of an infinite subordination of
genera and species, and hence the necessary existence of universals. Apparently
the impossibility of our forming a definite and complete conception of an infinite
series, i.e. of comprehending it as a whole, has been confounded with a logical
inconsistency, or contradiction in the idea itself.
8. The analysis of the following argument depends upon the theory of Primary
Propositions.
Proposition III.
That unchangeable and independent Being must be self-existent.
The premises are:–
1. Every being must either have come into existence out of nothing, or it
must have been produced by some external cause, or it must be self-existent.
2. No being has come into existence out of nothing.
3. The unchangeable and independent Being has not been produced by an
external cause.
For the symbolical expression of the above, let us assume,
x = Beings which have arisen out of nothing.
y = Beings which have been produced by an external cause.
z = Beings which are self-existent.
w = The unchangeable and independent Being.
Then we have
x(1 - y)(1 - z) + y(1 - x)(1 - z) + z(1 - x)(1 - y) = l, (1)
x = 0, (2)
w = v(1 - y), (3)
1Metaphysics, III. 4; Anal. Post. I, 19, et seq.
2Nic. Ethics, Book I. Cap. II.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 151
from the last of which eliminating v,
wy = 0. (4)
Whenever, as above, the value of a symbol is given as 0 or 1, it is best
eliminated by simple substitution. Thus the elimination of x gives
y(1 - z) + z(1 - y) = 1; (5)
or, yz + (1 - y)(1 - z) = 0. (6)
Now adding (4) and (6), and eliminating y, we get
w(1 - z) = 0,
? w = vz;
the interpretation of which is,–The unchangeable and independent being is
necessarily self-existing.
Of (5), in its actual form, the interpretation is,–Every being has either been
produced by an external cause, or it is self-existent.
9. In Dr. Samuel Clarke’s observations on the above proposition occurs a
remarkable argument, designed to prove that the material world is not the selfexistent
being above spoken of. The passage to which I refer is the following:
“If matter be supposed to exist necessarily, then in that necessary existence
there is either included the power of gravitation, or not. If not, then in a world
merely material, and in which no intelligent being presides, there never could
have been any motion; because motion, as has been already shown, and is now
granted in the question, is not necessary of itself. But if the power of gravitation
be included in the pretended necessary existence of matter: then, it following
necessarily that there must be a vacuum (as the incomparable Sir Isaac Newton
has abundantly demonstrated that there must, if gravitation be an universal
quality or affection of matter), it follows likewise, that matter is not a necessary
being. For if a vacuum actually be, then it is plainly more than possible for
matter not to be.”–(pp. 25, 26).
It will, upon attentive examination, be found that the actual premises involved
in the above demonstration are the following:
1st. If matter is a necessary being, either the property of gravitation is
necessarily present, or it is necessarily absent.
2nd. If gravitation is necessarily absent, and the world is not subject to any
presiding Intelligence, motion does not exist.
3rd. If the property of gravitation is necessarily present, existence of a
vacuum is necessary.
4th. If the existence of a vacuum is necessary, matter is not necessary being.
5th. If matter is a necessary being, the world is not subject to a presiding
Intelligence.
6th. Motion exists.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 152
Of the above premises the first four are expressed in the demonstration; the
fifth is implied in the connexion of its first and second sentences; and the sixth
expresses a fact, which the author does not appear to have thought it necessary
to state, but which is obviously a part of the ground of his reasoning. Let us
represent the elementary propositions in the following manner:
Let x = Matter is a necessary being.
y = Gravitation is necessarily present.
t = Gravitation is necessarily absent.
z = The world is merely material, and not subject to any presiding Intelligence.
w = Motion exists.
v = A vacuum is necessary.
Then the system of premises will be represented by the following equations,
in which q is employed as the symbol of time indefinite:
x = q{y(1 - t) + (1 - y)t}.
tz = q(1 - w).
y = qv.
v = q(1 - x).
x = qz.
w = 1.
From which, if we eliminate the symbols q, we have the following system,
viz.:
x{yt + (1 - y)(1 - t)} = 0. (1)
tzw = 0. (2)
y(1 - v) = 0. (3)
vx = 0. (4)
x(1 - z) = 0. (5)
1 - w = 0. (6)
Now if from these equations we eliminate w, v, z, y, and t, we obtain the
equation
x = 0,
which expresses the proposition, Matter is not a necessary being. This is Dr.
Clarke’s conclusion. If we endeavour to eliminate any other set of five symbols
(except the set v, z, y, t, and x, which would give w = 1), we obtain a result
of the form 0 = 0. It hence appears that there are no other conclusions expressive
of the absolute truth or falsehood of any of the elementary propositions
designated by single symbols.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 153
Of conclusions expressed by equations involving two symbols, there exists
but the following, viz.:– If the world is merely material, and not subject to a
presiding Intelligence, gravitation is not necessarily absent. This conclusion is
expressed by the equation
tz = 0, whence z = q(1 - t).
If in the above analysis we suppress the concluding premiss, expressing the
fact of the existence of motion, and leave the hypothetical principles which are
embodied in the remaining premises untouched, some remarkable conclusions
follow. To these I shall direct attention in the following chapter.
10. Of the remainder of Dr. Clarke’s argument I shall briefly state the
substance and connexion, dwelling only on certain portions of it which are of a
more complex character than the others, and afford better illustrations of the
method of this work.
In Prop. iv. it is shown that the substance or essence of the self-existent
being is incomprehensible. The tenor of the reasoning employed is, that we are
ignorant of the essential nature of all other things,–much more, then, of the
essence of the self-existent being.
In Prop. v. it is contended that “though the substance or essence of the
self-existent being is itself absolutely incomprehensible to us, yet many of the
essential attributes of his nature are strictly demonstrable, as well as his existence.”
In Prop. vi. it is argued that “the self-existent being must of necessity be
infinite and omnipresent;” and it is contended that his infinity must be “an
infinity of fulness as well as of immensity.” The ground upon which the demonstration
proceeds is, that an absolute necessity of existence must be independent
of time, place, and circumstance, free from limitation, and therefore excluding
all imperfection. And hence it is inferred that the self-existent being must be “a
most simple, unchangeable, incorruptible being, without parts, figure, motion,
or any other such properties as we find in matter.”
The premises actually employed may be exhibited as follows:
1. If a finite being is self-existent, it is a contradiction to suppose it not to
exist.
2. A finite being may, without contradiction, be absent from one place.
3. That which may without contradiction be absent from one place may
without contradiction be absent from all places.
4. That which may without contradiction be absent from all places may
without contradiction be supposed not to exist.
Let us assume
x = Finite beings.
y = Things self-existent.
z = Things which it is a contradiction to suppose not to exist.
w = Things which may be absent without contradiction from one place.
t = Things which without contradiction may be absent from every place.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 154
We have on expressing the above, and eliminating the indefinite symbols,
xy(1 - z) = 0. (1)
x(1 - w) = 0. (2)
w(1 - t) = 0. (3)
tz = 0. (4)
Eliminating in succession t, w, and z, we get
xy = 0,
? y =
0
0
(1 - x);
the interpretation of which is,–Whatever is self-existent is infinite.
In Prop. vii. it is argued that the self-existent being must of necessity be
One. The order of the proof is, that the self-existent being is “necessarily existent,”
that “necessity absolute in itself is simple and uniform, and without any
possible difference or variety,” that all “variety or difference of existence” implies
dependence; and hence that “whatever exists necessarily is the one simple
essence of the self-existent being.”
The conclusion is also made to flow from the following premises:—
1. If there are two or more necessary and independent beings, either of them
may be supposed to exist alone.
2. If either may be supposed to exist alone, it is not a contradiction to
suppose the other not to exist.
3. If it is not a contradiction to suppose this, there are not two necessary
and independent beings.
Let us represent the elementary propositions as follows:–
x = there exist two necessary independent beings.
y = either may be supposed to exist alone.
z = it is not a contradiction to suppose the other not to exist.
We have then, on proceeding as before,
x(1 - y) = 0. (1)
y(1 - z) = 0. (2)
zx = 0. (3)
Eliminating y and z, we have
x = 0.
Whence, There do not exist two necessary and independent beings.
11. To the premises upon which the two previous propositions rest, it is well
known that Bishop Butler, who at the time of the publication of the “Demonstration,”
was a student in a non-conformist academy, made objection in some
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 155
celebrated letters, which, together with Dr. Clarke’s replies to them, are usually
appended to editions of the work. The real question at issue is the validity
of the principle, that “whatsoever is absolutely necessary at all is absolutely
necessary in every part of space, and in every point of duration,”—a principle
assumed in Dr. Clarke’s reasoning, and explicitly stated in his reply to Butler’s
first letter. In his second communication Butler says: “I do not conceive that
the idea of ubiquity is contained in the idea of self-existence, or directly follows
from it, any otherwise than as whatever exists must exist somewhere.” That
is to say, necessary existence implies existence in some part of space, but not
in every part. It does not appear that Dr. Clarke was ever able to dispose
effectually of this objection. The whole of the correspondence is extremely curious
and interesting. The objections of Butler are precisely those which would
occur to an acute mind impressed with the conviction, that upon the sifting
of first principles, rather than upon any mechanical dexterity of reasoning, the
successful investigation of truth mainly depends. And the replies of Dr. Clarke,
although they cannot be admitted as satisfactory, evince, in a remarkable degree,
that peculiar intellectual power which is manifest in the work from which
the discussion arose.
12. In Prop. viii. it is argued that the self-existent and original cause of all
things must be an Intelligent Being.
The main argument adduced in support of this proposition is, that as the
cause is more excellent than the effect, the self-existent being, as the cause and
original of all things, must contain in itself the perfections of all things; and that
Intelligence is one of the perfections manifested in a part of the creation. It is
further argued that this perfection is not a modification of figure, divisibility,
or any of the known properties of matter; for these are not perfections, but
limitations. To this is added the `a posteriori argument from the manifestation
of design in the frame of the universe.
There is appended, however, a distinct argument for the existence of an
intelligent self-existent being, founded upon the phænomenal existence of motion
in the universe. I shall briefly exhibit this proof, and shall apply to it the method
of the present treatise.
The argument, omitting unimportant explanations, is as follows:–
”’Tis evident there is some such a thing as motion in the world; which
either began at some time or other, or was eternal. If it began in time, then the
question is granted that the first cause is an intelligent being.... On the contrary,
if motion was eternal, either it was eternally caused by some eternal intelligent
being, or it must of itself be necessary and self-existent, or else, without any
necessity in its own nature, and without any external necessary cause, it must
have existed from eternity by an endless successive communication. If motion
was eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being, this also is granting
the question as to the present dispute. If it was of itself necessary and selfexistent,
then it follows that it must be a contradiction in terms to suppose any
matter to be at rest. And yet, at the same time, because the determination
of this self-existent motion must be every way at once, the effect of it would
be nothing else but a perpetual rest.... But if it be said that motion, without
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 156
any necessity in its own nature, and without any external necessary cause, has
existed from eternity merely by an endless successive communication, as Spinoza
inconsistently enough seems to assert, this I have before shown (in the proof of
the second general proposition of this discourse) to be a plain contradiction.
It remains, therefore, that motion must of necessity be originally caused by
something that is intelligent.”
The premises of the above argument may be thus disposed:
1. If motion began in time, the first cause is an intelligent being. 2. If
motion has existed from eternity, either it has been eternally caused by some
eternal intelligent being, or it is self-existent, or it must have existed by endless
successive communication.
3. If motion has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being, the
first cause is an intelligent being.
4. If it is self-existent, matter is at rest and not at rest.
5. That motion has existed by endless successive communication, and that
at the same time it is not self-existent, and has not been eternally caused by
some eternal intelligent being, is false.
To express these propositions, let us assume—
x = Motion began in time (and therefore)
1 - x = Motion has existed from eternity.
y = The first cause is an intelligent being.
p = Motion has been eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being.
q = Motion is self-existent.
r = Motion has existed by endless successive communication.
s = Matter is at rest.
The equations of the premises then are—
x = vy.
1-x = v {p (1 - q) (1 - r) + q (1 - p) (1 - r) + r (1 - p) (1 - q)} .
p = vy.
q = vs (1 - s) = 0.
r (1 - q) (1 - p) = 0.
Since, by the fourth equation, q = 0, we obtain, on substituting for q its value
in the remaining equations, the system
x = vy,
p = vy,
1 - x = v {p (1 - r) + r (1 - p)} ,
r (1 - p) = 0,
from which eliminating the indefinite symbols v, we have the final reduced
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 157
system,
x (1 - y) = 0, (1)
(1 - x) {pr + (1 - p) (1 - r)} = 0, (2)
p (1 - y) = 0. (3)
r (1 - p) = 0. (4)
We shall first seek the value of y, the symbol involved in Dr. Clarke’s conclusion.
First, eliminating x from (1) and (2), we have
(1 - y){pr + (1 - p)(1 - r)} = 0. (5)
Next, to eliminate r from (4) and (5), we have
r(l - p) + (1 - y){pr + (1 - p)(1 - r)} = 0,
? {1 - p + (1 - y)p} × (1 - y)(1 - p) = 0;
whence
(1 - y)(1 - p) = 0. (6)
Lastly, eliminating p from (3) and (6), we have
1 - y = 0,
? y = 1,
which expresses the required conclusion, The first cause is an intelligent
being.
Let us now examine what other conclusions are deducible from the premises.
If we substitute the value just found for y in the equations (1), (2), (3), (4),
they are reduced to the following pair of equations, viz.,
(1 - x){pr + (l - p)(l - r)} = 0, r(l - p) = 0. (7)
Eliminating from these equations x, we have
r(1 - p) = 0, whence r = vp,
which expresses the conclusion, If motion has existed by endless successive communication,
it has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being.
Again eliminating, from the given pair, r, we have
(1 - x)(1 - p) = 0,
or, 1 - x = vp,
which expresses the conclusion, If motion has existed from eternity, it has been
eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being.
Lastly, from the same original pair eliminating p, we get
(1 - x)r = 0,
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 158
which, solved in the form
1 - x = r(1 - r),
gives the conclusion, If motion has existed from eternity, it has not existed
by an endless successive communication.
Solved under the form
r = vx,
the above equation leads to the equivalent conclusion, If motion exists by an
endless successive communication, it began in time.
13. Now it will appear to the reader that the first and last of the above
four conclusions are inconsistent with each other. The two consequences drawn
from the hypothesis that motion exists by an endless successive communication,
viz., 1st, that it has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being; 2ndly,
that it began in time,—are plainly at variance. Nevertheless, they are both
rigorous deductions from the original premises. The opposition between them
is not of a logical, but of what is technically termed a material, character. This
opposition might, however, have been formally stated in the premises. We
might have added to them a formal proposition, asserting that “whatever is
externally caused by an eternal intelligent being, does not begin in time.” Had
this been done, no such opposition as now appears in our conclusions could
have presented itself. Formal logic can only take account of relations which are
formally expressed (VI. 16); and it may thus, in particular instances, become
necessary to express, in a formal manner, some connexion among the premises
which, without actual statement, is involved in the very meaning of the language
employed.
To illustrate what has been said, let us add to the equations (2) and (4) the
equation
px = 0,
which expresses the condition above adverted to. We have
(1 - x){pr + (1 - p)(1 - r)} + r(1 - p) + px = 0. (8)
Eliminating p from this, we find simply
r = 0,
which expresses the proposition, Motion does not exist by an endless successive
communication. If now we substitute for r its value in (8), we have
(1 - x)(1 - p) + px = 0, or, 1 - x = p;
whence we have the interpretation, If motion has existed from eternity, it has
been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being; together with the converse
of that proposition.
In Prop. ix. it is argued, that “the self-existent and original cause of all
things is not a necessary agent, but a being endued with liberty and choice.”
The proof is based mainly upon his possession of intelligence, and upon the
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 159
existence of final causes, implying design and choice. To the objection that the
supreme cause operates by necessity for the production of what is best, it is
replied, that this is a necessity of fitness and wisdom, and not of nature.
14. In Prop. x. it is argued, that “the self-existent being, the supreme
cause of all things, must of necessity have infinite power.” The ground of the
demonstration is, that as “all the powers of all things are derived from him,
nothing can make any difficulty or resistance to the execution of his will.” It is
defined that the infinite power of the self-existent being does not extend to the
“making of a thing which implies a contradiction,” or the doing of that “which
would imply imperfection (whether natural or moral) in the being to whom such
power is ascribed,” but that it does extend to the creation of matter, and of an
immaterial, cogitative substance, endued with a power of beginning motion, and
with a liberty of will or choice. Upon this doctrine of liberty it is contended that
we are able to give a satisfactory answer to “that ancient and great question,
p??e? t? ?a???, what is the cause and original of evil?” The argument on this
head I shall briefly exhibit,
“All that we call evil is either an evil of imperfection, as the want of certain
faculties or excellencies which other creatures have; or natural evil, as pain,
death, and the like; or moral evil, as all kinds of vice. The first of these is
not properly an evil; for every power, faculty, or perfection, which any creature
enjoys, being the free gift of God,. . . it is plain the want of any certain faculty
or perfection in any kind of creatures, which never belonged to their natures
is no more an evil to them, than their never having been created or brought
into being at all could properly have been called an evil. The second kind of
evil, which we call natural evil, is either a necessary consequence of the former,
as death to a creature on whose nature immortality was never conferred; and
then it is no more properly an evil than the former. Or else it is counterpoised
on the whole with as great or greater good, as the afflictions and sufferings
of good men, and then also it is not properly an evil; or else, lastly, it is a
punishment, and then it is a necessary consequence of the third and last kind
of evil, viz., moral evil. And this arises wholly from the abuse of liberty which
God gave to His creatures for other purposes, and which it was reasonable and
fit to give them for the perfection and order of the whole creation. Only they,
contrary to God’s intention and command, have abused what was necessary to
the perfection of the whole, to the corruption and depravation of themselves.
And thus all sorts of evils have entered into the world without any diminution
to the infinite goodness of the Creator and Governor thereof.”—p. 112.
The main premises of the above argument may be thus stated:
1st. All reputed evil is either evil of imperfection, or natural evil, or moral
evil.
2nd. Evil of imperfection is not absolute evil.
3rd. Natural evil is either a consequence of evil of imperfection, or it is
compensated with greater good, or it is a consequence of moral evil.
4th. That which is either a consequence of evil of imperfection, or is compensated
with greater good, is not absolute evil.
5th. All absolute evils are included in reputed evils.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 160
To express these premises let us assume—
w = reputed evil.
x = evil of imperfection.
y = natural evil.
z = moral evil.
p = consequence of evil of imperfection.
q = compensated with greater good.
r = consequence of moral evil.
t = absolute evil.
Then, regarding the premises as Primary Propositions, of which all the predicates
are particular, and the conjunctions either, or, as absolutely disjunctive,
we have the following equations:
w = v {x(1 - y)(1 - q) + y(1 - x)(1 - z) + z(1 - x)(1 - y)}
x = v(1 - t).
y = v {p(1 - q)(1 - r) + q(1 - p)(1 - r) + r(1 - p)(1 - q)}
p(l - q) + q(l - p) = v(1 - t).
t = vw .
From which, if we separately eliminate the symbol v, we have
w {1 - x(1 - y)(1 - z) - y(1 - x)(1 - z) - z(1 - x)(1 - y)} = 0, (1)
xt = 0, (2)
y {1 - p(1 - q)(1 - r) - q(1 - p)(1 - r) - r(1 - p)(1 - q)} = 0, (3)
{p(1 - q) + q(1 - p)} t = 0, (4)
t(1 - w) = 0. (5)
Let it be required, first, to find what conclusion the premises warrant us
in forming respecting absolute evils, as concerns their dependence upon moral
evils, and the consequences of moral evils.
For this purpose we must determine t in terms of z and r.
The symbols w, x, y, p, q must therefore be eliminated. The process is easy,
as any set of the equations is reducible to a single equation by addition.
Eliminating w from (1) and (5), we have
t {1 - x(1 - y)(1 - z) - y(1 - x)(1 - z) - z(1 - x)(1 - y)} = 0. (6)
The elimination of p from (3) and (4) gives
yqr + yqt + yt(1 - r)(1 - q) = 0. (7)
The elimination of q from this gives
yt(1 - r) = 0. (8)
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 161
The elimination of x between (2) and (6) gives
t {yz + (1 - y)(1 - z)} = 0. (9)
The elimination of y from (8) and (9) gives
t(1 - z)(1 - r) = 0.
This is the only relation existing between the elements t, z, and r. We hence
get
t =
0
(1 - z)(1 - r)
=
0
0
zr +
0
0
z(1 - r) + 0
0
(1 - z)r + 0(1 - z)(1 - r)
=
0
0
z +
0
0
(1 - z)r;
the interpretation of which is, Absolute evil is either moral evil, or it is, if not
moral evil, a consequence of moral evil.
Any of the results obtained in the process of the above solution furnish us
with interpretations. Thus from (8) we might deduce
t =
0
y(1 - r)
=
0
0
yr +
0
0
(1 - y)r +
0
0
(1 - y)(1 - r)
=
0
0
yr +
0
0
(1 - y);
whence, Absolute evils are either natural evils, which are the consequences of
moral evils, or they are not natural evils at all.
A variety of other conclusions may be deduced from the given equations in
reply to questions which may be arbitrarily proposed. Of such I shall give a few
examples, without exhibiting the intermediate processes of solution.
Quest. 1.—Can any relation be deduced from the premises connecting the
following elements, viz.: absolute evils, consequences of evils of imperfection,
evils compensated with greater good?
Ans.—No relation exists. If we eliminate all the symbols but z, p, q, the
result is 0 = 0.
Quest. 2.—Is any relation implied between absolute evils, evils of imperfection,
and consequences of evils of imperfection.
Ans.—The final relation between x, t, and p is
xt + pt = 0;
whence
t =
0
p + x
=
0
0
(1 - p)(1 - x).
Therefore, Absolute evils are neither evils of imperfection, nor consequences of
evils of imperfection. Quest. 3. — Required the relation of natural evils to evils
of imperfection and evils compensated with greater good.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 162
We find
pqy = 0,
? y =
0
pq
=
0
0
p(1 - q) + 0
0
(1 - p).
Therefore, Natural evils are either consequences of evils of imperfection which
are not compensated with greater good, or they are not consequences of evils of
imperfection at all.
Quest. 4. — In what relation do those natural evils which are not moral
evils stand to absolute evils and the consequences of moral evils?
If y(1 - z) = s, we find, after elimination,
ts(1 - r) = 0;
? s =
0
t(1 - r)
=
0
0
tr +
0
0
(1 - t).
Therefore, Natural evils, which are not moral evils, are either absolute evils,
which are the consequences of moral evils, or they are not absolute evils at all.
The following conclusions have been deduced in a similar manner. The
subject of each conclusion will show of what particular things a description was
required, and the predicate will show what elements it was designed to involve:
—
Absolute evils, which are not consequences of moral evils, are moral and not
natural evils.
Absolute evils which are not moral evils are natural evils, which are the
consequences of moral evils.
Natural evils which are not consequences of moral evils are not absolute evils.
Lastly, let us seek a description of evils which are not absolute, expressed in
terms of natural and moral evils.
We obtain as the final equation,
1 - t = yz +
0
0
y(1 - z) + 0
0
(1 - y)z + (1 - y)(1 - z).
The direct interpretation of this equation is a necessary truth, but the reverse
interpretation is remarkable. Evils which are both natural and moral, and evils
which are neither natural nor moral, are not absolute evils.
This conclusion, though it may not express a truth, is certainly involved in
the given premises, as formally stated.
15. Let us take from the same argument a somewhat fuller system of
premises, and let us in those premises suppose that the particles, either, or,
are not absolutely disjunctive, so that in the meaning of the expression, “either
evil of imperfection, or natural evil, or moral evil,” we include whatever
possesses one or more of these qualities.
Let the premises be —
1. All evil (w) is either evil of imperfection (x), or natural evil (y), or moral
evil (z).
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 163
2. Evil of imperfection (x) is not absolute evil (t).
3. Natural evil (y) is either a consequence of evil of imperfection (p), or it
is compensated with greater good (q), or it is a consequence of moral evil (r).
4. Whatever is a consequence of evil of imperfection (p) is not absolute evil
(t).
5. Whatever is compensated with greater good (q) is not absolute evil (t).
6. Moral evil (z) is a consequence of the abuse of liberty (u).
7. That which is a consequence of moral evil (r) is a consequence of the
abuse of liberty (u).
8. Absolute evils are included in reputed evils.
The premises expressed in the usual way give, after the elimination of the
indefinite symbols v, the following equations:
w(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = 0, (1)
xt = 0, (2)
y(1 - p)(1 - q)(1 - r) = 0, (3)
pt = 0, (4)
qt = 0, (5)
z(1 - u) = 0, (6)
r(1 - u) = 0, (7)
t(1 - w) = 0. (8)
Each of these equations satisfies the condition V (1 - V ) = 0.
The following results are easily deduced —
Natural evil is either absolute evil, which is a consequence of moral evil, or
it is not absolute evil at all.
All evils are either absolute evils, which are consequences of the abuse of
liberty, or they are not absolute evils.
Natural evils are either evils of imperfection, which are not absolute evils, or
they are not evils of imperfection at all.
Absolute evils are either natural evils, which are consequences of the abuse
of liberty, or they are not natural evils, and at the same time not evils of imperfection.
Consequences of the abuse of liberty include all natural evils which are absolute
evils, and are not evils of imperfection, with an indefinite remainder of
natural evils which are not absolute, and of evils which are not natural.
16. These examples will suffice for illustration. The reader can easily supply
others if they are needed. We proceed now to examine the most essential
portions of the demonstration of Spinoza.
definitions.
1. By a cause of itself (causa sui), I understand that of which the essence
involves existence, or that of which the nature cannot be conceived except as
existing.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 164
2. That thing is said to be finite or bounded in its own kind (in suo genere
finita) which may be bounded by another thing of the same kind; e. g. Body is
said to be finite, because we can always conceive of another body greater than
a given one. So thought is bounded by other thought. But body is not bounded
by thought, nor thought by body.
3. By substance, I understand that which is in itself (in se), and is conceived
by itself (per se concipitur), i.e., that whose conception does not require to be
formed from the conception of another thing.
4. By attribute, I understand that which the intellect perceives in substance,
as constituting its very essence.
5. By mode, I understand the affections of substance, or that which is in
another thing, by which thing also it is conceived.
6. By God, I understand the Being absolutely infinite, that is the substance
consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses an eternal and infinite
essence.
Explanation.—I say absolutely infinite, not infinite in its own kind. For to
whatever is only infinite in its own kind we may deny the possession of (some)
infinite attributes. But when a thing is absolutely infinite, whatsoever expresses
essence and involves no negation belongs to its essence.
7. That thing is termed free, which exists by the sole necessity of its own
nature, and is determined to action by itself alone; necessary, or rather constrained,
which is determined by another thing to existence and action, in a
certain and determinate manner.
8. By eternity, I understand existence itself, in so far as it is conceived
necessarily to follow from the sole definition of the eternal thing.
Explanation.—For such existence, as an eternal truth, is conceived as the
essence of the thing, and therefore cannot be explained by mere duration or
time, though the latter should be conceived as without beginning and without
end.
axioms.
1. All things which exist are either in themselves in se or in another thing.
2. That which cannot be conceived by another thing ought to be conceived
by itself.
3. From a given determinate cause the effect necessarily follows, and, contrariwise,
if no determinate cause be granted, it is impossible that an effect
should follow.
4. The knowledge of the effect depends upon, and involves, the knowledge
of the cause.
5. Things which have nothing in common cannot be understood by means
of each other; or the conception of the one does not involve the conception of
the other.
6. A true idea ought to agree with its own object. (Idea vera debet cum suo
ideato convenire.)
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 165
7. Whatever can be conceived as non-existing does not involve existence in its
essence. Other definitions are implied, and other axioms are virtually assumed,
in some of the demonstrations. Thus, in Prop. I., “Substance is prior in nature
to its affections,” the proof of which consists in a mere reference to Defs. 3
and 5, there seems to be an assumption of the following axiom, viz., “That by
which a thing is conceived is prior in nature to the thing conceived.” Again,
in the demonstration of Prop. V. the converse of this axiom is assumed to be
true. Many other examples of the same kind occur. It is impossible, therefore,
by the mere processes of Logic, to deduce the whole of the conclusions of the
first book of the Ethics from the axioms and definitions which are prefixed to
it, and which are given above. In the brief analysis which will follow, I shall
endeavour to present in their proper order what appear to me to be the real
premises, whether formally stated or implied, and shall show in what manner
they involve the conclusions to which Spinoza was led.
17. I conceive, then, that in the course of his demonstration, Spinoza effects
several parallel divisions of the universe of possible existence, as,
1st. Into things which are in themselves, x, and things which are in some
other thing, x
0
; whence, as these classes of thing together make up the universe,
we have
x + x
0 = 1; (Ax. i.)
or, x = 1 - x
0
.
2nd. Into things which are conceived by themselves, y, and things which are
conceived through some other thing,y
0
; whence
y = 1 - y
0
. (Ax. ii)
3rd. Into substance, z, and modes, z
0
; whence
z = 1 - z
0
. (Def. iii. v.)
4th. Into things free, f, and things necessary,f
0
; whence
f = 1 - f
0
. (Def. vii.)
5th. Into things which are causes and self-existent, e, and things caused by
some other thing, e
0
; whence
e = 1 - e
0
. (Def. i. Ax. vii.)
And his reasoning proceeds upon the expressed or assumed principle, that these
divisions are not only parallel, but equivalent. Thus in Def. iii., Substance is
made equivalent with that which is conceived by itself; whence
z = y.
Again, Ax. iv., as it is actually applied by Spinoza, establishes the identity of
cause with that by which a thing is conceived; whence
y = e.
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 166
Again, in Def. vii., things free are identified with things self-existent; whence
f = e.
Lastly, in Def. v mode is made identical with that which is in another thing;
whence z
0 = x
0
, and therefore,
z = x.
All these results may be collected together into the following series of equations,
viz.:
x = y = z = f = e = 1 - x
0 = 1 - y
0 = 1 - f
0 = 1 - z
0 = 1 - e
0
.
And any two members of this series connected together by the sign of equality
express a conclusion, whether drawn by Spinoza or not, which is a legitimate
consequence of his system. Thus the equation
z = 1 - e
0
,
expresses the sixth proposition of his system, viz., One substance cannot be
produced by another. Similarly the equation
z = e,
expresses his seventh proposition, viz., “It pertains to the nature of substance
to exist.” This train of deduction it is unnecessary to pursue. Spinoza applies
it chiefly to the deduction according to his views of the properties of the Divine
Nature, having first endeavoured to prove that the only substance is God. In the
steps of this process, there appear to me to exist some fallacies, dependent chiefly
upon the ambiguous use of words, to which it will be necessary here to direct
attention. 18. In Prop. v. it is endeavoured to show, that “There cannot exist
two or more substances of the same nature or attribute.” The proof is virtually
as follows: If there are more substances than one, they are distinguished either
by attributes or modes; if by attributes, then there is only one substance of
the same attribute; if by modes, then, laying aside these as non-essential, there
remains no real ground of distinction. Hence there exists but one substance
of the same attribute. The assumptions here involved are inconsistent with
those which are found in other parts of the treatise. Thus substance, Def. iv.,
is apprehended by the intellect through the means of attribute. By Def. vi.
it may have many attributes. One substance may, therefore, conceivably be
distinguished from another by a difference in some of its attributes, while others
remain the same.
In Prop. viii. it is attempted to show that, All substance is necessarily
infinite. The proof is as follows. There exists but one substance, of one attribute,
Prop. v.; and it pertains to its nature to exist, Prop. vii. It will, therefore,
be of its nature to exist either as finite or infinite. But not as finite, for, by
Def. ii. it would require to be bounded by another substance of the same nature,
which also ought to exist necessarily, Prop. vii. Therefore, there would be two
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 167
substances of the same attribute, which is absurd, Prop. v. Substance, therefore,
is infinite.
In this demonstration the word “finite” is confounded with the expression,
“Finite in its own kind,” Def. ii. It is thus assumed that nothing can be finite,
unless it is bounded by another thing of the same kind. This is not consistent
with the ordinary meaning of the term. Spinoza’s use of the term finite tends to
make space the only form of substance, and all existing things but affections of
space, and this, I think, is really one of the ultimate foundations of his system.
The first scholium applied to the above Proposition is remarkable. I give
it in the original words: “Quum finitum esse revera sit ex parte negatio, et
infinitum absoluta affirmatio existentiae alicujus naturae, sequitur ergo ex sola
Prop. vii. omnem substantiam debere esse infinitam.” Now this is in reality an
assertion of the principle affirmed by Clarke, and controverted by
Butler (XIII. 11), that necessary existence implies existence in every part of
space. Probably this principle will be found to lie at the basis of every attempt
to demonstrate, `a priori, the existence of an Infinite Being.
From the general properties of substance above stated, and the definition
of God as the substance consisting of infinite attributes, the peculiar doctrines
of Spinoza relating to the Divine Nature necessarily follow. As substance is
self-existent, free, causal in its very nature, the thing in which other things
are, and by which they are conceived; the same properties are also asserted
of the Deity. He is self-existent, Prop. xi.; indivisible, Prop. xiii.; the only
substance, Prop. xiv.; the Being in which all things are, and by which all things
are conceived, Prop. xv.; free, Prop. xvii.; the immanent cause of all things,
Prop. xviii. The proof that God is the only substance is drawn from Def. vi.,
which is interpreted into a declaration that “God is the Being absolutely infinite,
of whom no attribute which expresses the essence of substance can be denied.”
Every conceivable attribute being thus assigned by definition to Him, and it
being determined in Prop. v. that there cannot exist two substances of the
same attribute, it follows that God is the only substance.
Though the “Ethics” of Spinoza, like a large portion of his other writings,
is presented in the geometrical form, it does not afford a good praxis for the
symbolical method of this work. Of course every train of reasoning admits, when
its ultimate premises are truly determined, of being treated by that method;
but in the present instance, such treatment scarcely differs, except in the use of
letters for words, from the processes employed in the original demonstrations.
Reasoning which consists so largely of a play upon terms defined as equivalent,
is not often met with; and it is rather on account of the interest attaching to
the subject, than of the merits of the demonstrations, highly as by some they
are esteemed, that I have devoted a few pages here to their exposition.
19. It is not possible, I think, to rise from the perusal of the arguments of
Clarke and Spinoza without a deep conviction of the futility of all endeavours
to establish, entirely `a priori, the existence of an Infinite Being, His attributes,
and His relation to the universe. The fundamental principle of all such speculations,
viz., that whatever we can clearly conceive, must exist, fails to accomplish
its end, even when its truth is admitted. For how shall the finite comprehend
CHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 168
the infinite? Yet must the possibility of such conception be granted, and in
something more than the sense of a mere withdrawal of the limits of phaenomenal
existence, before any solid ground can be established for the knowledge,
`a priori, of things infinite and eternal. Spinoza’s affirmation of the reality of
such knowledge is plain and explicit: “Mens humana adaequatum habet cognitionem
aeternae et infinitae essentiae Dei” (Prop. xlvii., Part 2nd). Let this be
compared with Prop. xxxiv., Part 2nd: “Omnis idea quae in nobis est absoluta
sive adaequata et perfecta, vera est;” and with Axiom vi., Part 1st, “Idea vera
debet cum suo ideato convenire.” Moreover, this species of knowledge is made
the essential constituent of all other knowledge: “De natura rationis est res sub
quadam aeternitatis specie percipere” (Prop. xliv., Cor. ii., Part 2nd). Were
it said, that there is a tendency in the human mind to rise in contemplation
from the particular towards the universal, from the finite towards the infinite,
from the transient towards the eternal; and that this tendency suggests to us,
with high probability, the existence of more than sense perceives or understanding
comprehends; the statement might be accepted as true for at least a large
number of minds. There is, however, a class of speculations, the character of
which must be explained in part by reference to other causes,—impatience of
probable or limited knowledge, so often all that we can really attain to; a desire
for absolute certainty where intimations sufficient to mark out before us the
path of duty, but not to satisfy the demands of the speculative intellect, have
alone been granted to us; perhaps, too, dissatisfaction with the present scene
of things. With the undue predominance of these motives, the more sober procedure
of analogy and probable induction falls into neglect. Yet the latter is,
beyond all question, the course most adapted to our present condition. To infer
the existence of an intelligent cause from the teeming evidences of surrounding
design, to rise to the conception of a moral Governor of the world, from the
study of the constitution and the moral provisions of our own nature;– these,
though but the feeble steps of an understanding limited in its faculties and its
materials of knowledge, are of more avail than the ambitious attempt to arrive
at a certainty unattainable on the ground of natural religion. And as these were
the most ancient, so are they still the most solid foundations, Revelation being
set apart, of the belief that the course of this world is not abandoned to chance
and inexorable fate.
Chapter XIV
EXAMPLE OF THE ANALYSIS OF A SYSTEM OF
EQUATIONS BY THE METHOD OF REDUCTION TO
A SINGLE EQUIVALENT EQUATION V = 0,
WHEREIN V SATISFIES THE CONDITION
V (1 - V ) = 0.
1. Let us take the remarkable system of premises employed in the previous
Chapter, to prove that “Matter is not a necessary being;” and suppressing the
6th premiss, viz., Motion exists,—examine some of the consequences which flow
from the remaining premises. This is in reality to accept as true Dr. Clarke’s
hypothetical principles; but to suppose ourselves ignorant of the fact of the
existence of motion. Instances may occur in which such a selection of a portion
of the premises of an argument may lead to interesting consequences, though it
is with other views that the present example has been resumed. The premises
actually employed will be—
1. If matter is a necessary being, either the property of gravitation is necessarily
present, or it is necessarily absent.
2. If gravitation is necessarily absent, and the world is not subject to any
presiding intelligence, motion does not exist.
3. If gravitation is necessarily present, a vacuum is necessary.
4. If a vacuum is necessary, matter is not a necessary being.
5. If matter is a necessary being, the world is not subject to a presiding
intelligence.
If, as before, we represent the elementary propositions by the following notation,
viz.:
x = Matter is a necessary being.
y = Gravitation is necessarily present.
w = Motion exists.
t = Gravitation is necessarily absent.
z = The world is merely material, and not subject to a presiding intelligence.
v = A vacuum is necessary.

CHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 170
We shall on expression of the premises and elimination of the indefinite class
symbols (q), obtain the following system of equations:
xyt + xy¯t¯ = 0,
tzw = 0,
yv¯ = 0,
vx = 0,
xz¯ = 0;
in which for brevity ¯y stands for 1 - y, t¯ for 1 - t, and so on; whence, also,
1 - t¯= t, 1 - y¯ = y, &c.
As the first members of these equations involve only positive terms, we can
form a single equation by adding them together (VIII. Prop. 2), viz.:
xyt + xy¯t¯+ yv¯ + vx + xz¯ + tzw = 0,
and it remains to reduce the first member so as to cause it to satisfy the condition
V (1 - V ) = 0.
For this purpose we will first obtain its development with reference to the
symbols x and y. The result is—
(t + ¯v + v + ¯z + tzw)xy + (t¯+ v + ¯z + tzw)xy¯
+(¯v + tzw)¯xy + tzwx¯y¯ = 0.
And our object will be accomplished by reducing the four coefficients of the
development to equivalent forms, themselves satisfying the condition required.
Now the first coefficient is, since v + ¯v = 1,
1 + t + ¯z + tzw,
which reduces to unity (IX. Prop. 1).
The second coefficient is
t¯+ v + ¯z + tzw;
and its reduced form (X. 3) is
t¯+ tv + tv¯z¯ + tvzw. ¯
The third coefficient, ¯v + tzw, reduces by the same method to ¯v + tzwv; and
the last coefficient tzw needs no reduction. Hence the development becomes
xy + (t¯+ tv + tv¯z¯ + tvzw ¯ ) xy¯ + (¯v + tzwv) ¯xy + tzwx¯y¯ = 0; (1)
and this is the form of reduction sought.
2. Now according to the principle asserted in Prop. iii., Chap. x., the whole
relation connecting any particular set of the symbols in the above equation may
be deduced by developing that equation with reference to the particular symbols
CHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 171
in question, and retaining in the result only those constituents whose coefficients
are unity. Thus, if x and y are the symbols chosen, we are immediately conducted
to the equation
xy = 0,
whence we have
y =
0
0
(1 - x),
with the interpretation, If gravitation is necessarily present, matter is not a
necessary being.
Let us next seek the relation between x and w. Developing (1) with respect
to those symbols, we get
(y + t¯y¯ + tvy¯ + tv¯z¯y¯ + tvz¯ y¯) xw + (y + t¯y¯ + tvy¯ + tv¯z¯y¯) xw¯
+ (¯vy + tzvy + tzy¯) ¯xw + ¯vyxw¯ = 0.
The coefficient of xw, and it alone, reduces to unity. For tv¯z¯y¯+tvz¯ y¯ = tv¯y¯, and
tvy¯ + tv¯y¯ = ty¯, and t¯y¯ + ty¯ = ¯y, and lastly, y + ¯y = 1. This is always the mode
in which such reductions take place. Hence we get
xw = 0,
? w =
0
0
(1 - x),
of which the interpretation is, If motion exists, matter is not a necessary being.
If, in like manner, we develop (1) with respect to x and z, we get the equation
xz¯ = 0,
? x =
0
0
z,
with the interpretation, If matter is a necessary being, the world is merely material,
and without a presiding intelligence.
This, indeed, is only the fifth premiss reproduced, but it shows that there is
no other relation connecting the two elements which it involves.
If we seek the whole relation connecting the elements x, w, and y, we find,
on developing (1) with reference to those symbols, and proceeding as before,
xy + xwy¯ = 0.
Suppose it required to determine hence the consequences of the hypothesis,
“Motion does not exist,” relatively to the questions of the necessity of matter,
and the necessary presence of gravitation. We find
w =
-xy
xy¯
,
? 1 - w =
x
xy¯
=
1
0
xy + xy¯ +
0
0
x¯;
or, 1 - w = xy¯ +
0
0
x, ¯ with xy = 0.
CHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 172
The direct interpretation of the first equation is, If motion does not exist, either
matter is a necessary being, and gravitation is not necessarily present, or matter
is not a necessary being.
The reverse interpretation is, If matter is a necessary being, and gravitation
not necessary, motion does not exist.
In exactly the same mode, if we sought the full relation between x, z, and
w, we should find
xzw + xz¯ = 0.
From this we may deduce
z = xw¯ +
0
0
x, ¯ with xw = 0.
Therefore, If the world is merely material, and not subject to any presiding
intelligence, either matter is a necessary being, and motion does not exist, or
matter is not a necessary being.
Also, reversely, If matter is a necessary being, and there is no such thing as
motion, the world is merely material.
3. We might, of course, extend the same method to the determination of
the consequences of any complex hypothesis u, such as, “The world is merely
material, and without any presiding intelligence (z), but motion exists” (w),
with reference to any other elements of doubt or speculation involved in the
original premises, such as, “Matter is a necessary being” (x), “Gravitation is a
necessary quality of matter,” (y). We should, for this purpose, connect with the
general equation (1) a new equation,
u = wz,
reduce the system thus formed to a single equation, V = 0, in which V satisfies
the condition V (1 - V ) = 0, and proceed as above to determine the relation
between u, x, and y, and finally u as a developed function of x and y. But
it is very much better to adopt the methods of Chapters viii. and ix. I shall
here simply indicate a few results, with the leading steps of their deduction, and
leave their verification to the reader’s choice.
In the problem last mentioned we find, as the relation connecting x, y, w,
and z,
xw + xwy¯ + xw¯y¯z¯ = 0.
And if we write u = xy, and then eliminate the symbols x and y by the general
problem, Chap. ix., we find
xu + xyu¯ = 0,
whence
u =
1
0
xy + 0xy¯ +
0
0
x¯;
wherefore
wz =
0
0
x¯ with xy = 0.
CHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 173
Hence, If the world is merely material, and without a presiding intelligence, and
at the same time motion exists, matter is not a necessary being.
Now it has before been shown that if motion exists, matter is not a necessary
being, so that the above conclusion tells us even less than we had before ascertained
to be (inferentially) true. Nevertheless, that conclusion is the proper and
complete answer to the question which was proposed, which was, to determine
simply the consequences of a certain complex hypothesis. 4. It would thus be
easy, even from the limited system of premises before us, to deduce a great
variety of additional inferences, involving, in the conditions which are given,
any proposed combinations of the elementary propositions. If the condition is
one which is inconsistent with the premises, the fact will be indicated by the
form of the solution. The value which the method will assign to the combination
of symbols expressive of the proposed condition will be 0. If, on the other
hand, the fulfilment of the condition in question imposes no restriction upon the
propositions among which relation is sought, so that every combination of those
propositions is equally possible,—the fact will also be indicated by the form of
the solution. Examples of each of these cases are subjoined.
If in the ordinary way we seek the consequences which would flow from the
condition that matter is a necessary being, and at the same time that motion
exists, as affecting the Propositions, The world is merely material, and without
a presiding intelligence, and, Gravitation is necessarily present, we shall obtain
the equation
xw = 0,
which indicates that the condition proposed is inconsistent with the premises,
and therefore cannot be fulfilled.
If we seek the consequences which would flow from the condition that Matter
is not a necessary being, and at the same time that Motion does exist, with reference
to the same elements as above, viz., the absence of a presiding intelligence,
and the necessity of gravitation,–we obtain the following result,
(1 - x)w =
0
0
yz +
0
0
y(1 - z) + 0
0
(1 - y)z +
0
0
(1 - y)(1 - z),
which might literally be interpreted as follows:
If matter is not a necessary being, and motion exists, then either the world
is merely material and without a presiding intelligence, and gravitation is necessary,
or one of these two results follows without the other, or they both fail of
being true. Wherefore of the four possible combinations, of which some one is
true of necessity, and of which of necessity one only can be true, it is affirmed
that any one may be true. Such a result is a truism— a mere necessary truth.
Still it contains the only answer which can be given to the question proposed.
I do not deem it necessary to vindicate against the charge of laborious trifling
these applications. It may be requisite to enter with some fulness into details
useless in themselves, in order to establish confidence in general principles and
methods. When this end shall have been accomplished in the subject of the
present inquiry, let all that has contributed to its attainment, but has afterwards
been found superfluous, be forgotten.
Chapter XV
THE ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC AND ITS MODERN
EXTENSIONS, EXAMINED BY THE METHOD OF
THIS TREATISE.
1. The logical system of Aristotle, modified in its details, but unchanged in its
essential features, occupies so important a place in academical education, that
some account of its nature, and some brief discussion of the leading problems
which it presents, seem to be called for in the present work. It is, I trust, in no
narrow or harshly critical spirit that I approach this task. My object, indeed,
is not to institute any direct comparison between the time-honoured system of
the schools and that of the present treatise; but, setting truth above all other
considerations, to endeavour to exhibit the real nature of the ancient doctrine,
and to remove one or two prevailing misapprehensions respecting its extent and
sufficiency.
That which may be regarded as essential in the spirit and procedure of the
Aristotelian, and of all cognate systems of Logic, is the attempted classification
of the allowable forms of inference, and the distinct reference of those forms, collectively
or individually, to some general principle of an axiomatic nature, such
as the “dictum of Aristotle:” Whatsoever is affirmed or denied of the genus may
in the same sense be affirmed or denied of any species included under that genus.
Concerning such general principles it may, I think, be observed, that they either
state directly, but in an abstract form, the argument which they are supposed to
elucidate, and, so stating that argument, affirm its validity; or involve in their
expression technical terms which, after definition, conduct us again to the same
point, viz., the abstract statement of the supposed allowable forms of inference.
The idea of classification is thus a pervading element in those systems. Furthermore,
they exhibit Logic as resolvable into two great branches, the one of which
is occupied with the treatment of categorical, the other with that of hypothetical
or conditional propositions. The distinction is nearly identical with that of
primary and secondary propositions in the present work. The discussion of the
theory of categorical propositions is, in all the ordinary treatises of Logic, much
more full and elaborate than that of hypothetical propositions, and is occupied
partly with ancient scholastic distinctions, partly with the canons of deductive
inference. To the latter application only is it necessary to direct attention here.
174
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 175
2. Categorical propositions are classed under the four following heads, viz.:
type
1st. Universal affirmative Propositions: All Y ’s are X’s.
2nd. Universal negative ” No Y ’s are X’s.
3rd. Particular affirmative ” Some Y ’s are X’s.
4th. Particular negative ” Some Y ’s are not X’s.
To these forms, four others have recently been added, so as to constitute in
the whole eight forms (see the next article) susceptible, however, of reduction
to six, and subject to relations which have been discussed with great fulness
and ability by Professor De Morgan, in his Formal Logic. A scheme somewhat
different from the above has been given to the world by Sir W. Hamilton, and
is made the basis of a method of syllogistic inference, which is spoken of with
very high respect by authorities on the subject of Logic.1
The processes of Formal Logic, in relation to the above system of propositions,
are described as of two kinds, viz., “Conversion” and “Syllogism.” By
Conversion is meant the expression of any proposition of the above kind in an
equivalent form, but with a reversed order of terms. By Syllogism is meant the
deduction from two such propositions having a common term, whether subject
or predicate, of some third proposition inferentially involved in the two, and
forming the “conclusion.” It is maintained by most writers on Logic, that these
processes, and according to some, the single process of Syllogism, furnish the
universal types of reasoning, and that it is the business of the mind, in any train
of demonstration, to conform itself, whether consciously or unconsciously, to the
particular models of the processes which have been classified in the writings of
logicians.
3. The course which I design to pursue is to show how these processes of
Syllogism and Conversion may be conducted in the most general manner upon
the principles of the present treatise, and, viewing them thus in relation to a
system of Logic, the foundations of which, it is conceived, have been laid in the
ultimate laws of thought, to seek to determine their true place and essential
character.
The expressions of the eight fundamental types of proposition in the language
of symbols are as follows:
1. All Y ’s are X’s, y = vx.
2. No Y ’s are X’s, y = v(1 - x).
3. Some Y ’s are X’s, vy = vx.
4. Some Y ’s are not-X’s, vy = v(1 - x).
5. All not-Y ’s are X’s, 1 - y = vx. (1)
6. No not-Y ’s are X’s, 1 - y = v(l - x).
7. Some not-Y ’s are X’s, v(l - y) = vx.
8. Some not-Y ’s are not-X’s,v(1 - y) = v(1 - x).
In referring to these forms, it will be convenient to apply, in a sense shortly to
be explained, the epithets of logical quantity, “universal” and “particular,” and
1Thomson’s Outlines of the Laws of Thought, p. 177.
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 176
of quality, “affirmative” and “negative,” to the terms of propositions, and not
to the propositions themselves. We shall thus consider the term “All Y ’s,” as
universal-affirmative; the term “Y ’s,” or “Some Y ’s,” as particular-affirmative;
the term “All not-Y ’s,” as universal-negative; the term “Some not-Y ’s,” as
particular-negative. The expression “No Y ’s,” is not properly a term of a proposition,
for the true meaning of the proposition, “No Y ’s are X’s,” is “All Y ’s
are not-X’s.” The subject of that proposition is, therefore, universal-affirmative,
the predicate particular-negative. That there is a real distinction between the
conceptions of “men” and “not men” is manifest. This distinction is all that I
contemplate when applying as above the designations of affirmative and negative,
without, however, insisting upon the etymological propriety of the application
to the terms of propositions. The designations positive anil privative would
have been more appropriate, but the former term is already employed in a fixed
sense in other parts of this work.
4. From the symbolical forms above given the laws of conversion immediately
follow. Thus from the equation
y = vx,
representing the proposition, “All Y ’s are X’s,” we deduce, on eliminating v,
y(1 - x) = 0,
which gives by solution with reference to 1 - x,
1 - x =
0
0
(1 - y);
the interpretation of which is,
All not-X’s are not-Y ’s.
This is an example of what is called “negative conversion.” In like manner,
the equation
y = v(1 - x),
representing the proposition, “No Y ’s are X’s,” gives
x =
0
0
(1 - y),
the interpretation of which is, “No X’s are Y ’s.” This is an example of what
is termed simple conversion; though it is in reality of the same kind as the
conversion exhibited in the previous example. All the examples of conversion
which have been noticed by logicians are either of the above kind, or of that
which consists in the mere transposition of the terms of a proposition, without
altering their quality, as when we change
vy = vx, representing, Some Y ’s are X’s,
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 177
into
vx = vy, representing, Some X’s are Y ’s;
or they involve a combination of those processes with some auxiliary process of
limitation, as when from the equation
y = vx, representing, All Y ’s are X’s,
we deduce on multiplication by v,
vy = vx, representing, Some Y ’s are X’s,
and hence
vx = vy, representing, Some X’s are Y ’s.
In this example, the process of limitation precedes that of transposition.
From these instances it is seen that conversion is a particular application of
a much more general process in Logic, of which many examples have been given
in this work. That process has for its object the determination of any element
in any proposition, however complex, as a logical function of the remaining elements.
Instead of confining our attention to the subject and predicate, regarded
as simple terms, we can take any element or any combination of elements entering
into either of them; make that element, or that combination, the “subject”
of a new proposition; and determine what its predicate shall be, in accordance
with the data afforded to us. It may be remarked, that even the simple forms of
propositions enumerated above afford some ground for the application of such a
method, beyond what the received laws of conversion appear to recognise. Thus
the equation
y = vx, representing, All Y ’s are X’s,
gives us, in addition to the proposition before deduced, the three following:
1st. y(1 - x) = 0. There are no Y ’s that are not-X’s.
2nd. 1 - y =
0
0
x + (1 - x). Things that are not-Y ’s include all
things that are not-X’s, and an
indefinite remainder of things
that are X’s.
3rd. x = y +
0
0
(1 - y). Things that are X’s include all things
that are Y ’s, and an indefinite
remainder of things that are notY
’s.
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 178
These conclusions, it is true, merely place the given proposition in other and
equivalent forms,–but such and no more is the office of the received mode of
“negative conversion.”
Furthermore, these processes of conversion are not elementary, but they are
combinations of processes more simple than they, more immediately dependent
upon the ultimate laws and axioms which govern the use of the symbolical instrument
of reasoning. This remark is equally applicable to the case of Syllogism,
which we proceed next to consider.
5. The nature of syllogism is best seen in the particular instance. Suppose
that we have the propositions,
All X’s are Y ’s,
All Y ’s are Z’s.
From these we may deduce the conclusion,
All X’s are Z’s.
This is a syllogistic inference. The terms X and Z are called the extremes, and
Y is called the middle term. The function of the syllogism generally may now
be defined. Given two propositions of the kind whose species are tabulated in
(1), and involving one middle or common term Y , which is connected in one of
the propositions with an extreme X, in the other with an extreme Z; required
the relation connecting the extremes X and Z. The term Y may appear in its
affirmative form, as, All Y ’s, Some Y ’s; or in its negative form, as, All not-Y ’s,
Some not-Y ’s; in either proposition, without regard to the particular form which
it assumes in the other.
Nothing is easier than in particular instances to resolve the Syllogism by the
method of this treatise. Its resolution is, indeed, a particular application of the
process for the reduction of systems of propositions. Taking the examples above
given, we have,
x = vy,
y = v
0
z;
whence by substitution,
x = vv0
z,
which is interpreted into
All X’s are Z’s.
Or, proceeding rigorously in accordance with the method developed in (VIII.7),
we deduce
x(1 - y) = 0, y(1 - z) = 0.
Adding these equations, and eliminating y, we have
x(1 - z) = 0;
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 179
whence x =
0
0
z, or, All X’s are Z’s.
And in the same way may any other case be treated.
6. Quitting, however, the consideration of special examples, let us examine
the general forms to which all syllogism may be reduced.
Proposition I.
To deduce the general rules of Syllogism.
By the general rules of Syllogism, I here mean the rules applicable to premises
admitting of every variety both of quantity and of quality in their subjects and
predicates, except the combination of two universal terms in the same proposition.
The admissible forms of propositions are therefore those of which a tabular
view is given in (1).
Let X and Y be the elements or things entering into the first premiss, Z and
Y those involved in the second. Two cases, fundamentally different in character,
will then present themselves. The terms involving Y will either be of like or
of unlike quality, those terms being regarded as of like quality when they both
speak of “Y ’s,” or both of “Not-Y ’s,” as of unlike quality when one of them
speaks of “Y ’s,” and the other of “Not-Y ’s.” Any pair of premises, in which the
former condition is satisfied, may be represented by the equations
vx = v
0
y, (1)
wz = w
0
y; (2)
for we can employ the symbol y to represent either “All Y ’s,” or “All not-Y ’s,”
since the interpretation of the symbol is purely conventional. If we employ y
in the sense of “All not-Y ’s,” then 1 - y will represent “All Y ’s,” and no other
change will be introduced. An equal freedom is permitted with respect to the
symbols x and z, so that the equations (1) and (2) may, by properly assigning
the interpretations of x, y, and z, be made to represent all varieties in the
combination of premises dependent upon the quality of the respective terms.
Again, by assuming proper interpretations to the symbols v, v
0
, w, w
0
, in those
equations, all varieties with reference to quantity may also be represented. Thus,
if we take v = 1, and represent by v
0 a class indefinite, the equation (1) will
represent a universal proposition according to the ordinary sense of that term,
i. e., a proposition with universal subject and particular predicate. We may, in
fact, give to subject and predicate in either premiss whatever quantities (using
this term in the scholastic sense) we please, except that by hypothesis, they
must not both be universal. The system (1), (2), represents, therefore, with
perfect generality, the possible combinations of premises which have like middle
terms.
7. That our analysis may be as general as the equations to which it is
applied, let us, by the method of this work, eliminate y from (1) and (2), and
seek the expressions for x, 1 - x, and vx, in terms of z and of the symbols v,
v
0
, w, w
0
. The above will include all the possible forms of the subject of the
conclusion. The form v(1 - x) is excluded, inasmuch as we cannot from the
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 180
interpretation vx = Some X’s, given in the premises, interpret v(1-x) as Some
not-X’s. The symbol v, when used in the sense of “some,” applies to that term
only with which it is connected in the premises.
The results of the analysis are as follows:
x =

. (III.)
Each of these expressions involves in its second member two terms, of one
of which z is a factor, of the other 1 - z. But syllogistic inference does not, as a
matter of form, admit of contrary classes in its conclusion, as of Z’s and not-Z’s
together.
We must, therefore, in order to determine the rules of that species of inference,
ascertain under what conditions the second members of any of our
equations are reducible to a single term.
The simplest form is (III.), and it is reducible to a single term if w
0 = 1.
The equation then becomes
vx = vv0wz, (3)
the first member is identical with the extreme in the first premiss; the second is
of the same quantity and quality as the extreme in the second premiss. For since
w
0 = 1, the second member of (2), involving the middle term y, is universal;
therefore, by the hypothesis, the first member is particular, and therefore, the
second member of (3), involving the same symbol w in its coefficient, is particular
also. Hence we deduce the following law.
Condition of Inference.—One middle term, at least, universal.
Rule of Inference.—Equate the extremes.
From an analysis of the equations (I.) and (II.), it will further appear, that
the above is the only condition of syllogistic inference when the middle terms
are of like quality. Thus the second member of (I.) reduces to a single term, if
w
0 = 1 and v = 1; and the second member of (II.) reduces to a single term, if
w
0 = 1, v = 1, w = 1. In each of these cases, it is necessary that w
0 = 1, the
solely sufficient c
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 181
Consider, secondly, the case in which the middle terms are of unlike quality.
The premises may then be represented under the forms
vx = v
0
y, (4)
wz = w
0
(l - y); (5)
and if, as before, we eliminate y, and determine the expressions of x, 1 - x, and
vx, we get

Now the second member of (VI.) reduces to a single term relatively to z, if

the second member of which is opposite, both in quantity and quality, to the
corresponding extreme, wz, in the second premiss. For since w = 1, wz is
universal. But the factor vv0
indicates that the term to which it is attached
is particular, since by hypothesis v and v
0 are not both equal to 1. Hence we
deduce the following law of inference in the case of like middle terms:
First Condition of Inference.—At least one universal extreme.
Rule of Inference.—Change the quantity and quality of that extreme,
and equate the result to the other extreme.
Moreover, the second member of (V.) reduces to a single term if v
0 = 1,
w
0 = 1; it then gives
1 - x = {vw +
0
0
(1 - v)w}z.
Now since v
0 = 1, w
0 = 1, the middle terms of the premises are both universal,
therefore the extremes vx, wz, are particular. But in the conclusion the extreme
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 182
involving x is opposite, both in quantity and quality, to the extreme vx in the
first premiss, while the extreme involving z agrees both in quantity and quality
with the corresponding extreme wz in the second premiss. Hence the following
general law:
Second Condition of Inference.—Two universal middle terms.
Rule of Inference.—Change the quantity and quality of either extreme,
and equate the result to the other extreme unchanged.
There are in the case of unlike middle terms no other conditions or rules of
syllogistic inference than the above. Thus the equation (IV.), though reducible
to the form of a syllogistic conclusion, when w = 1 and v = 1, does not thereby
establish a new condition of inference; since, by what has preceded, the single
condition v = 1, or w = 1, would suffice.
8. The following examples will sufficiently illustrate the general rules of
syllogism above given:
1. All Y ’s are X’s.
All Z’s are Y ’s.
This belongs to Case 1. All Y ’s is the universal middle term. The extremes
equated give as the conclusion
All Z’s are X’s;
the universal term, All Z’s, becoming the subject; the particular term (some)
X’s, the predicate.
2. All X’s are Y ’s.
No Z’s are Y ’s.
The proper expression of these premises is
All X’s are Y ’s.
All Z’s are not-Y ’s.
They belong to Case 2, and satisfy the first condition of inference. The middle
term, Y ’s, in the first premiss, is particular-affirmative; that in the second premiss,
not-Y ’s, particular-negative. If we take All Z’s as the universal extreme,
and change its quantity and quality according to the rule, we obtain the term
Some not-Z’s, and this equated with the other extreme, All X’s, gives,
All X’s are not-Z’s, i. e., No X’s are Z’s.
If we commence with the other universal extreme, and proceed similarly, we
obtain the equivalent result,
No Z’s are X’s.
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 183
3. All Y ’s are X’s.
All not-Y ’s are Z’s.
Here also the middle terms are unlike in quality. The premises therefore belong
to Case 2, and there being two universal middle terms, the second condition of
inference is satisfied. If by the rule we change the quantity and quality of the
first extreme, (some) X’s, we obtain All not-X’s, which, equated with the other
extreme, gives
All not-X’s are Z’s.
The reverse order of procedure would give the equivalent result,
All not-Z’s are X’s.
The conclusions of the two last examples would not be recognised as valid
in the scholastic system of Logic, which virtually requires that the subject of
a proposition should be affirmative. They are, however, perfectly legitimate
in themselves, and the rules by which they are determined form undoubtedly
the most general canons of syllogistic inference. The process of investigation
by which they are deduced will probably appear to be of needless complexity;
and it is certain that they might have been obtained with greater facility, and
without the aid of any symbolical instrument whatever. It was, however, my
object to conduct the investigation in the most general manner, and by an
analysis thoroughly exhaustive. With this end in view, the brevity or prolixity
of the method employed is a matter of indifference. Indeed the analysis is
not properly that of the syllogism, but of a much more general combination of
propositions; for we are permitted to assign to the symbols v, v
0
, w, w
0
, any
class-interpretations that we please. To illustrate this remark, I will apply the
solution (I.) to the following imaginary case:
Suppose that a number of pieces of cloth striped with different colours were
submitted to inspection, and that the two following observations were made
upon them:
1st. That every piece striped with white and green was also striped with
black and yellow, and vice versˆa.
2nd. That every piece striped with red and orange was also striped with
blue and yellow, and vice versˆa. Suppose it then required to determine how
the pieces marked with green stood affected with reference to the colours white,
black, red, orange, and blue.
Here if we assume v = white, x = green, v
0 = black, y = yellow, w = red,
z = orange, w
0 = blue, the expression of our premises will be
vx = v
0
y,
wz = w
0
y,
agreeing with the system (1) (2). The equation (I.) then leads to the following
conclusion:
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 184
Pieces striped with green are either striped with orange, white, black, red,
and blue, together, all pieces possessing which character are included in those
striped with green; or they are striped with orange, white, and black, but not
with red or blue; or they are striped with orange, red, and blue, but not with
white or black; or they are striped with orange, but not with white or red; or
they are striped with white and black, but not with blue or orange; or they are
striped neither with white nor orange.
Considering the nature of this conclusion, neither the symbolical expression
(I.) by which it is conveyed, nor the analysis by which that expression is deduced,
can be considered as needlessly complex.
9. The form in which the doctrine of syllogism has been presented in this
chapter affords ground for an important observation. We have seen that in
each of its two great divisions the entire discussion is reducible, so far, at least,
as concerns the determination of rules and methods, to the analysis of a pair
of equations, viz., of the system (1), (2), when the premises have like middle
terms, and of the system (4), (5), when the middle terms are unlike. Moreover,
that analysis has been actually conducted by a method founded upon certain
general laws deduced immediately from the constitution of language, Chap. ii.
confirmed by the study of the operations of the human mind, Chap. iii., and
proved to be applicable to the analysis of all systems of equations whatever,
by which propositions, or combinations of propositions, can be represented,
Chap. viii. Here, then, we have the means of definitely resolving the question,
whether syllogism is indeed the fundamental type of reasoning,—whether the
study of its laws is co-extensive with the study of deductive logic. For if it be so,
some indication of the fact must be given in the systems of equations upon the
analysis of which we have been engaged. It cannot be conceived that syllogism
should be the one essential process of reasoning, and yet the manifestation of
that process present nothing indicative of this high quality of pre-eminence. No
sign, however, appears that the discussion of all systems of equations expressing
propositions is involved in that of the particular system examined in this chapter.
And yet writers on Logic have been all but unanimous in their assertion, not
merely of the supremacy, but of the universal sufficiency of syllogistic inference
in deductive reasoning. The language of Archbishop Whately, always clear
and definite, and on the subject of Logic entitled to peculiar attention, is very
express on this point. “For Logic,” he says, “which is, as it were, the Grammar
of Reasoning, does not bring forward the regular Syllogism as a distinct mode of
argumentation, designed to be substituted for any other mode; but as the form
to which all correct reasoning may be ultimately reduced.”2 And Mr. Mill, in a
chapter of his System of Logic, entitled, “Of Ratiocination or Syllogism,” having
enumerated the ordinary forms of syllogism, observes, “All valid ratiocination,
all reasoning by which from general propositions previously admitted, other
propositions, equally or less general, are inferred, may be exhibited in some of
the above forms.” And again: “We are therefore at liberty, in conformity with
the general opinion of logicians, to consider the two elementary forms of the first
2Elements of Logic, p. 13, ninth edition.
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 185
figure as the universal types of all correct ratiocination.” In accordance with
these views it has been contended that the science of Logic enjoys an immunity
from those conditions of imperfection and of progress to which all other sciences
are subject;3 and its origin from the travail of one mighty mind of old has, by a
somewhat daring metaphor, been compared to the mythological birth of Pallas.
As Syllogism is a species of elimination, the question before us manifestly
resolves itself into the two following ones:—1st. Whether all elimination is reducible
to Syllogism; 2ndly. Whether deductive reasoning can with propriety be
regarded as consisting only of elimination. I believe, upon careful examination,
the true answer to the former question to be, that it is always theoretically possible
so to resolve and combine propositions that elimination may subsequently
be effected by the syllogistic canons, but that the process of reduction would
in many instances be constrained and unnatural, and would involve operations
which are not syllogistic. To the second question I reply, that reasoning cannot,
except by an arbitrary restriction of its meaning, be confined to the process of
elimination. No definition can suffice which makes it less than the aggregate
of the methods which are founded upon the laws of thought, as exercised upon
propositions; and among those methods, the process of elimination, eminently
important as it is, occupies only a place.
Much of the error, as I cannot but regard it, which prevails respecting the
nature of the Syllogism and the extent of its office, seems to be founded in
a disposition to regard all those truths in Logic as primary which possess the
character of simplicity and intuitive certainty, without inquiring into the relation
which they sustain to other truths in the Science, or to general methods in
the Art, of Reasoning. Aristotle’s dictum de omni et nullo is a self-evident
principle, but it is not found among those ultimate laws of the reasoning faculty
to which all other laws, however plain and self-evident, admit of being traced,
and from which they may in strictest order of scientific evolution be deduced.
For though of every science the fundamental truths are usually the most simple
of apprehension, yet is not that simplicity the criterion by which their title to
be regarded as fundamental must be judged. This must be sought for in the
nature and extent of the structure which they are capable of supporting. Taking
this view, Leibnitz appears to me to have judged correctly when he assigned to
the “principle of contradiction” a fundamental place in Logic;4
for we have seen
the consequences of that law of thought of which it is the axiomatic expression
(III. 15). But enough has been said upon the nature of deductive inference and
upon its constitutive elements. The subject of induction may probably receive
some attention in another part of this work.
10. It has been remarked in this chapter that the ordinary treatment of hypothetical,
is much more defective than that of categorical, propositions. What
is commonly termed the hypothetical syllogism appears, indeed, to be no syllogism
at all.
Let the argument—

4Nouveaux Essais sur l’entendement humain. Liv. iv. cap. 2. Theodic´ee Pt. I. sec. 44.
CHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 186
If A is B, C is D,
But A is B,
Therefore C is D,
be put in the form—
If the proposition X is true, Y is true,
But X is true,
Therefore Y is true;
wherein by X is meant the proposition A is B, and by Y , the proposition C
is D. It is then seen that the premises contain only two terms or elements,
while a syllogism essentially involves three. The following would be a genuine
hypothetical syllogism:
If X is true, Y is true;
If Y is true, Z is true;
? If X is true, Z is true.
After the discussion of secondary propositions in a former part of this work,
it is evident that the forms of hypothetical syllogism must present, in every respect,
an exact counterpart to those of categorical syllogism. Particular Propositions,
such as, “Sometimes if X is true, Y is true,” may be introduced, and the
conditions and rules of inference deduced in this chapter for categorical syllogisms
may, without abatement, be interpreted to meet the corresponding cases
in hypotheticals.
11. To what final conclusions are we then led respecting the nature and
extent of the scholastic logic? I think to the following: that it is not a science,
but a collection of scientific truths, too incomplete to form a system of themselves,
and not sufficiently fundamental to serve as the foundation upon which
a perfect system may rest. It does not, however, follow, that because the logic
of the schools has been invested with attributes to which it has no just claim,
it is therefore undeserving of regard. A system which has been associated with
the very growth of language, which has left its stamp upon the greatest questions
and the most famous demonstrations of philosophy, cannot be altogether
unworthy of attention. Memory, too, and usage, it must be admitted, have
much to do with the intellectual processes; and there are certain of the canons
of the ancient logic which have become almost inwoven in the very texture of
thought in cultured minds. But whether the mnemonic forms, in which the
particular rules of conversion and syllogism have been exhibited, possess any
real utility,—whether the very skill which they are supposed to impart might
not, with greater advantage to the mental powers, be acquired by the unassisted
efforts of a mind left to its own resources,—are questions which it might still be
not unprofitable to examine. As concerns the particular results deduced in this
chapter, it is to be observed, that they are solely designed to aid the inquiry
concerning the nature of the ordinary or scholastic logic, and its relation to a
more perfect theory of deductive reasoning.
Chapter XVI
ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES
1. Before the expiration of another year just two centuries will have rolled
away since Pascal solved the first known question in the theory of Probabilities,
and laid, in its solution, the foundations of a science possessing no common
share of the attraction which belongs to the more abstract of mathematical
speculations. The problem which the Chevalier de M´er´e, a reputed gamester,
proposed to the recluse of Port Royal (not yet withdrawn from the interests of
science1by the more distracting contemplation of the “greatness and the misery
of man”), was the first of a long series of problems, destined to call into existence
new methods in mathematical analysis, and to render valuable service in the
practical concerns of life. Nor does the interest of the subject centre merely
in its mathematical connexion, or its associations of utility. The attention is
repaid which is devoted to the theory of Probabilities as an independent object
of speculation,—to the fundamental modes in which it has been conceived,—
to the great secondary principles which, as in the contemporaneous science of
Mechanics, have gradually been annexed to it,—and, lastly, to the estimate of
the measure of perfection which has been actually attained. I speak here of that
perfection which consists in unity of conception and harmony of processes. Some
of these points it is designed very briefly to consider in the present chapter.
2. A distinguished writer2 has thus stated the fundamental definitions of the
science:
“The probability of an event is the reason we have to believe that it has
taken place, or that it will take place.”
“The measure of the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases
favourable to that event, to the total number of cases favourable or contrary,
and all equally possible” (equally likely to happen).
From these definitions it follows that the word probability, in its mathematical
acceptation, has reference to the state of our knowledge of the circumstances
under which an event may happen or fail. With the degree of information which
1See in particular a letter addressed by Pascal to Fermat, who had solicited his attention
to a mathematical problem (Port Royal, par M. de Sainte Beuve); also various passages in
the collection of Fragments published by M. Prosper Faug`ere.
2Poisson, Recherches sur la Probabilit`e des Jugemens.
187
CHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 188
we possess concerning the circumstances of an event, the reason we have to think
that it will occur, or, to use a single term, our expectation of it, will vary. Probability
is expectation founded upon partial knowledge. A perfect acquaintance
with all the circumstances affecting the occurrence of an event would change
expectation into certainty, and leave neither room nor demand for a theory of
probabilities.
3. Though our expectation of an event grows stronger with the increase of
the ratio of the number of the known cases favourable to its occurrence to the
whole number of equally possible cases, favourable or unfavourable, it would be
unphilosophical to affirm that the strength of that expectation, viewed as an
emotion of the mind, is capable of being referred to any numerical standard.
The man of sanguine temperament builds high hopes where the timid despair,
and the irresolute are lost in doubt. As subjects of scientific inquiry, there is
some analogy between opinion and sensation. The thermometer and the carefully
prepared photographic plate indicate, not the intensity of the sensations
of heat and light, but certain physical circumstances which accompany the production
of those sensations. So also the theory of probabilities contemplates the
numerical measure of the circumstances upon which expectation is founded; and
this object embraces the whole range of its legitimate applications. The rules
which we employ in life-assurance, and in the other statistical applications of the
theory of probabilities, are altogether independent of the mental phænomena of
expectation. They are founded upon the assumption that the future will bear
a resemblance to the past; that under the same circumstances the same event
will tend to recur with a definite numerical frequency; not upon any attempt to
submit to calculation the strength of human hopes and fears.
Now experience actually testifies that events of a given species do, under
given circumstances, tend to recur with definite frequency, whether their true
causes be known to us or unknown. Of course this tendency is, in general, only
manifested when the area of observation is sufficiently large. The judicial records
of a great nation, its registries of births and deaths, in relation to age and sex,
&c., present a remarkable uniformity from year to year. In a given language,
or family of languages, the same sounds, and successions of sounds, and, if it
be a written language, the same characters and successions of characters recur
with determinate frequency. The key to the rude Ogham inscriptions, found
in various parts of Ireland, and in which no distinction of words could at first
be traced, was, by a strict application of this principle, recovered.3The same
method, it is understood, has been applied 4
to the deciphering of the cuneiform
records recently disentombed from the ruins of Nineveh by the enterprise of Mr.
Layard.
4. Let us endeavour from the above statements and definitions to form a
conception of the legitimate object of the theory of Probabilities.
3The discovery is due to the Rev. Charles Graves, Professor of Mathematics in the University
of Dublin.– Vide Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Feb. 14, 1848. Professor
Graves informs me that he has verified the principle by constructing sequence tables for all
the European languages.
4By the learned Orientalist, Dr. Edward Hincks.
CHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 189
Probability, it has been said, consists in the expectation founded upon a
particular kind of knowledge, viz., the knowledge of the relative frequency of
occurrence of events. Hence the probabilities of events, or of combinations
of events, whether deduced from a knowledge of the particular constitution of
things under which they happen, or derived from the long-continued observation
of a past series of their occurrences and failures, constitute, in all cases, our data.
The probability of some connected event, or combination of events, constitutes
the corresponding quæsitum, or object sought. Now in the most general, yet
strict meaning of the term “event,” every combination of events constitutes also
an event. The simultaneous occurrence of two or more events, or the occurrence
of an event under given conditions, or in any conceivable connexion with other
events, is still an event. Using the term in this liberty of application, the object
of the theory of probabilities might be thus defined. Given the probabilities
of any events, of whatever kind, to find the probability of some other event
connected with them.
5. Events may be distinguished as simple or compound, the latter term
being applied to such events as consist in a combination of simple events (I. 13).
In this manner we might define it as the practical end of the theory under
consideration to determine the probability of some event, simple or compound,
from the given probabilities of other events, simple or compound, with which,
by the terms of its definition, it stands connected.
Thus if it is known from the constitution of a die that there is a probability,
measured by the fraction 1
6
, that the result of any particular throw will be an
ace, and if it is required to determine the probability that there shall occur one
ace, and only one, in two successive throws, we may state the problem in the
order of its data and its quæsitum, as follows:
First Datum.—Probability of the event that the first throw will give an
ace =
1
6
.
Second Datum.—Probability of the event that the second throw will give
an ace =
1
6
.
Quæsitum.—Probability of the event that either the first throw will give an
ace, and the second not an ace; or the first will not give an ace, and the second
will give one.
Here the two data are the probabilities of simple events defined as the first
throw giving an ace, and the second throw giving an ace. The quæsitum is
the probability of a compound event,—a certain disjunctive combination of the
simple events involved or implied in the data. Probably it will generally happen,
when the numerical conditions of a problem are capable of being deduced, as
above, from the constitution of things under which they exist, that the data
will be the probabilities of simple events, and the quæsitum the probability of
a compound event dependent upon the said simple events. Such is the case
with a class of problems which has occupied perhaps an undue share of the
attention of those who have studied the theory of probabilities, viz., games of
chance and skill, in the former of which some physical circumstance, as the
CHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 190
constitution of a die, determines the probability of each possible step of the
game, its issue being some definite combination of those steps; while in the
latter, the relative dexterity of the players, supposed to be known `a priori,
equally determines the same element. But where, as in statistical problems, the
elements of our knowledge are drawn, not from the study of the constitution
of things, but from the registered observations of Nature or of human society,
there is no reason why the data which such observations afford should be the
probabilities of simple events. On the contrary, the occurrence of events or
conditions in marked combinations (indicative of some secret connexion of a
causal character) suggests to us the propriety of making such concurrences,
profitable for future instruction by a numerical record of their frequency. Now
the data which observations of this kind afford are the probabilities of compound
events. The solution, by some general method, of problems in which such data
are involved, is thus not only essential to the perfect development of the theory
of probabilities, but also a perhaps necessary condition of its application to a
large and practically important class of inquiries.
6. Before we proceed to estimate to what extent known methods may be
applied to the solution of problems such as the above, it will be advantageous
to notice, that there is another form under which all questions in the theory of
probabilities may be viewed; and this form consists in substituting for events
the propositions which assert that those events have occurred, or will occur; and
viewing the element of numerical probability as having reference to the truth of
those propositions, not to the occurrence of the events concerning which they
make assertion. Thus, instead of considering the numerical fraction p as expressing
the probability of the occurrence of an event E, let it be viewed as
representing the probability of the truth of the proposition X, which asserts
that the event E will occur. Similarly, instead of any probability, q, being considered
as referring to some compound event, such as the concurrence of the
events E and F, let it represent the probability of the truth of the proposition
which asserts that E and F will jointly occur; and in like manner, let the transformation
be made from disjunctive and hypothetical combinations of events to
disjunctive and conditional propositions. Though the new application thus assigned
to probability is a necessary concomitant of the old one, its adoption will
be attended with a practical advantage drawn from the circumstance that we
have already discussed the theory of propositions, have defined their principal
varieties, and established methods for determining, in every case, the amount
and character of their mutual dependence. Upon this, or upon some equivalent
basis, any general theory of probabilities must rest. I do not say that other
considerations may not in certain cases of applied theory be requisite. The data
may prove insufficient for definite solution, and this defect it may be thought
necessary to supply by hypothesis. Or, where the statement of large numbers
is involved, difficulties may arise after the solution, from this source, for which
special methods of treatment are required. But in every instance, some form of
the general problem as above stated (Art. 4) is involved, and in the discussion of
that problem the proper and peculiar work of the theory consists. I desire it to
be observed, that to this object the investigations of the following chapters are
CHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 191
mainly devoted. It is not intended to enter, except incidentally, upon questions
involving supplementary hypotheses, because it is of primary importance, even
with reference to such questions (I. 17), that a general method, founded upon
a solid and sufficient basis of theory, be first established.
7. The following is a summary, chiefly taken from Laplace, of the principles
which have been applied to the solution of questions of probability. They are
consequences of its fundamental definitions already stated, and may be regarded
as indicating the degree in which it has been found possible to render those
definitions available.
Principle 1st. If p be the probability of the occurrence of any event, 1 - p
will be the probability of its non-occurrence.
2nd. The probability of the concurrence of two independent events is the
product of the probabilities of those events.
3rd. The probability of the concurrence of two dependent events is equal
to the product of the probability of one of them by the probability that if that
event occur, the other will happen also.
4th. The probability that if an event, E, take place, an event, F, will also
take place, is equal to the probability of the concurrence of the events E and
F, divided by the probability of the occurrence of E.
5th. The probability of the occurrence of one or the other of two events
which cannot concur is equal to the sum of their separate probabilities.
6th. If an observed event can only result from some one of n different causes
which are `a priori equally probable, the probability of any one of the causes is
a fraction whose numerator is the probability of the event, on the hypothesis of
the existence of that cause, and whose denominator is the sum of the similar
probabilities relative to all the causes.
7th. The probability of a future event is the sum of the products formed by
multiplying the probability of each cause by the probability that if that cause
exist, the said future event will take place.
8. Respecting the extent and the relative sufficiency of these principles, the
following observations may be made.
1st. It is always possible, by the due combination of these principles, to
express the probability of a compound event, dependent in any manner upon
independent simple events whose distinct probabilities are given. A very large
proportion of the problems which have been actually solved are of this kind,
and the difficulty attending their solution has not arisen from the insufficiency
of the indications furnished by the theory of probabilities, but from the need of
an analysis which should render those indications available when functions of
large numbers, or series consisting of many and complicated terms, are thereby
introduced. It may, therefore, be fully conceded, that all problems having for
their data the probabilities of independent simple events fall within the scope
of received methods.
2ndly. Certain of the principles above enumerated, and especially the sixth
and seventh, do not presuppose that all the data are the probabilities of simple
events. In their peculiar application to questions of causation, they do, however,
assume, that the causes of which they take account are mutually exclusive,
CHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 192
so that no combination of them in the production of an effect is possible. If,
as before explained, we transfer the numerical probabilities from the events
with which they are connected to the propositions by which those events are
expressed, the most general problem to which the aforesaid principles are applicable

The probability of the truth of the proposition which declares the occurrence
of the event E; also, when that proposition is known to be true, the probabilities
of truth of the several propositions which affirm the respective occurrences of
the causes A1, A2 . . . An.
Here it is seen, that the data are the probabilities of a series of compound
events, expressed by conditional propositions. But the system is obviously a very
limited and particular one. For the antecedents of the propositions are subject
to the condition of being mutually exclusive, and there is but one consequent,
the event E, in the whole system. It does not follow, from our ability to discuss
such a system as the above, that we are able to resolve problems whose data are
the probabilities of any system of conditional propositions; far less that we can
resolve problems whose data are the probabilities of any system of propositions
whatever. And, viewing the subject in its material rather than its formal aspect,
it is evident, that the hypothesis of exclusive causation is one which is not often
realized in the actual world, the phænomena of which seem to be, usually, the
products of complex causes, the amount and character of whose co-operation is
unknown. Such is, without doubt, the case in nearly all departments of natural
or social inquiry in which the doctrine of probabilities holds out any new promise
of useful applications.
9. To the above principles we may add another, which has been stated in
the following terms by the Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of
Oxford.5
“Principle 8. If there be any number of mutually exclusive hypotheses,
h1, h2, h3, . . . of which the probabilities relative to a particular state of information
are p1, p2, p3, . . . and if new information be given which changes the
probabilities of some of them, suppose of hm+1 and all that follow, without

having otherwise any reference to the rest; then the probabilities of these latter
have the same ratios to one another, after the new information, that they had
before, that is,
p

: p

: p
0
3
. . . : p
0
m = p1 : p2 : p3 . . . : pm,
where the accented letters denote the values after the new information has been
acquired.”
This principle is apparently of a more fundamental character than the most
of those before enumerated, and perhaps it might, as has been suggested by
Professor Donkin, be regarded as axiomatic. It seems indeed to be founded in
the very definition of the measure of probability, as “the ratio of the number of
cases favourable to an event to the total number of cases favourable or contrary,
and all equally possible.” For, adopting this definition, it is evident that in
whatever proportion the number of equally possible cases is diminished, while
the number of favourable cases remains unaltered, in exactly the same proportion
will the probabilities of any events to which these cases have reference be
increased. And as the new hypothesis, viz., the diminution of the number of
possible cases without affecting the number of them which are favourable to the
events in question, increases the probabilities of those events in a constant ratio,
the relative measures of those probabilities remain unaltered. If the principle
we are considering be then, as it appears to be, inseparably involved in the very
definition of probability, it can scarcely, of itself, conduct us further than the
attentive study of the definition would alone do, in the solution of problems.
From these considerations it appears to be doubtful whether, without some aid
of a different kind from any that has yet offered itself to our notice, any considerable
advance, either in the theory of probabilities as a branch of speculative
knowledge, or in the practical solution of its problems can be hoped for. And
the establishment, solely upon the basis of any such collection of principles as
the above, of a method universally applicable to the solution of problems, without
regard either to the number or to the nature of the propositions involved in
the expression of their data, seems to be impossible. For the attainment of such
an object other elements are needed, the consideration of which will occupy the
next chapter.
Chapter XVII
DEMONSTRATION OF A GENERAL METHOD FOR
THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN THE THEORY
OF PROBABILITIES.
1. It has been defined (XVI. 2), that “the measure of the probability of an event
is the ratio of the number of cases favourable to that event, to the total number
of cases favourable or unfavourable, and all equally possible.” In the following
investigations the term probability will be used in the above sense of “measure
of probability.”
From the above definition we may deduce the following conclusions.
I. When it is certain that an event will occur, the probability of that event,
in the above mathematical sense, is 1. For the cases which are favourable to the
event, and the cases which are possible, are in this instance the same.
Hence, also, if p be the probability that an event x will happen, 1 - p will
be the probability that the said event will not happen. To deduce this result
directly from the definition, let m be the number of cases favourable to the
event x, n the number of cases possible, then n - m is the number of cases
unfavourable to the event x. Hence, by definition,
m
n
= probability that x will happen.
n - m
n
= probability that x will not happen.
But
n - m
n
= 1 -
m
n
= 1 - p.
II. The probability of the concurrence of any two events is the product of the
probability of either of those events by the probability that if that event occur,
the other will occur also.
Let m be the number of cases favourable to the happening of the first event,
and n the number of equally possible cases unfavourable to it; then the probability
of the first event is, by definition, m
m + n
. Of the m cases favourable
194
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 195
to the first event, let l cases be favourable to the conjunction of the first and
second events, then, by definition, l
m
is the probability that if the first event
happen, the second also will happen. Multiplying these fractions together, we
have
m
m + n
×
l
m
=
l
m + n
.
But the resulting fraction l
m+n
has for its numerator the number of cases
favourable to the conjunction of events, and for its denominator, the number
m + n of possible cases. Therefore, it represents the probability of the joint
occurrence of the two events.
Hence, if p be the probability of any event x, and q the probability that if x
occur y will occur, the probability of the conjunction xy will be pq.
III. The probability that if an event x occur, the event y will occur, is
a fraction whose numerator is the probability of their joint occurrence, and
denominator the probability of the occurrence of the event x.
This is an immediate consequence of Principle 2nd.
IV. The probability of the occurrence of some one of a series of exclusive
events is equal to the sum of their separate probabilities.
For let n be the number of possible cases; m1 the number of those cases
favourable to the first event; m2 the number of cases favourable to the second,
&c. Then the separate probabilities of the events are m1
n
,
m2
n
, &c. Again, as the
events are exclusive, none of the cases favourable to one of them is favourable to
another; and, therefore, the number of cases favourable to some one of the series
will be m1 + m2 . . . , and the probability of some one of the series happening
will be m1 + m2 . . .
n
. But this is the sum of the previous fractions, m1
n
,
m2
n
,
&c. Whence the principle is manifest. 2. Definition.—Two events are said
to be independent when the probability of the happening of either of them is
unaffected by our expectation of the occurrence or failure of the other.
From this definition, combined with Principle II., we have the following
conclusion:
V. The probability of the concurrence of two independent events is equal to
the product of the separate probabilities of those events.
For if p be the probability of an event x, q that of an event y regarded as
quite independent of x, then is q also the probability that if x occur y will occur.
Hence, by Principle II., pq is the probability of the concurrence of x and y
Under the same circumstances, the probability that x will occur and y not
occur will be p(1 - q). For p is the probability that x will occur, and 1 - q
the probability that y will not occur. In like manner (1 - p)(1 - q) will be the
probability that both the events fail of occurring.
3. There exists yet another principle, different in kind from the above, but
necessary to the subsequent investigations of this chapter, before proceeding
to the explicit statement of which I desire to make one or two preliminary
observations.
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 196
I would, in the first place, remark that the distinction between simple and
compound events is not one founded in the nature of events themselves, but
upon the mode or connexion in which they are presented to the mind. How
many separate particulars, for instance, are implied in the terms “To be in
health,” “To prosper,” &c., each of which might still be regarded as expressing
a “simple event”? The prescriptive usages of language, which have assigned to
particular combinations of events single and definite appellations, and have left
unnumbered other combinations to be expressed by corresponding combinations
of distinct terms or phrases, is essentially arbitrary. When, then, we designate
as simple events those which are expressed by a single verb, or by what grammarians
term a simple sentence, we do not thereby imply any real simplicity
in the events themselves, but use the term solely with reference to grammatical
expression. 4. Now if this distinction of events, as simple or compound, is
not founded in their real nature, but rests upon the accidents of language, it
cannot affect the question of their mutual dependence or independence. If my
knowledge of two simple events is confined to this particular fact, viz., that the
probability of the occurrence of one of them is p, and that of the other q; then
I regard the events as independent, and thereupon affirm that the probability
of their joint occurrence is pq. But the ground of this affirmation is not that
the events are simple ones, but that the data afford no information whatever
concerning any connexion or dependence between them. When the probabilities
of events are given, but all information respecting their dependence withheld,
the mind regards them as independent. And this mode of thought is equally
correct whether the events, judged according to actual expression, are simple
or compound, i.e., whether each of them is expressed by a single verb or by a
combination of verbs.
5. Let it, however, be supposed that, together with the probabilities of
certain events, we possess some definite information respecting their possible
combinations. For example, let it be known that certain combinations are excluded
from happening, and therefore that the remaining combinations alone
are possible. Then still is the same general principle applicable. The mode in
which we avail ourselves of this information in the calculation of the probability
of any conceivable issue of events depends not upon the nature of the events
whose probabilities and whose limits of possible connexion are given. It matters
not whether they are simple or compound. It is indifferent from what source, or
by what methods, the knowledge of their probabilities and of their connecting
relations has been derived. We must regard the events as independent of any
connexion beside that of which we have information, deeming it of no consequence
whether such information has been explicitly conveyed to us in the data,
or thence deduced by logical inference. And this leads us to the statement of the
general principle in question, viz.:
VI. The events whose probabilities are given are to be regarded as independent
of any connexion but such as is either expressed, or necessarily implied,
in the data; and the mode in which our knowledge of that connexion is to be
employed is independent of the nature of the source from which such knowledge
has been derived.
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 197
The practical importance of the above principle consists in the circumstance,
that whatever may be the nature of the events whose probabilities are given,—
whatever the nature of the event whose probability is sought, we are always
able, by an application of the Calculus of Logic, to determine the expression of
the latter event as a definite combination of the former events, and definitely
to assign the whole of the implied relations connecting the former events with
each other. In other words, we can determine what that combination of the
given events is whose probability is required, and what combinations of them
are alone possible. It follows then from the above principle, that we can reason
upon those events as if they were simple events, whose conditions of possible
combination had been directly given by experience, and of which the probability
of some definite combination is sought. The possibility of a general method in
probabilities depends upon this reduction.
6. As the investigations upon which we are about to enter are based upon
the employment of the Calculus of Logic, it is necessary to explain certain terms
and modes of expression which are derived from this application.
By the event x, I mean that event of which the proposition which affirms
the occurrence is symbolically expressed by the equation
x = 1.
By the event f(x, y, z, . . .), I mean that event of which the occurrence is expressed
by the equation
f(x, y, z, . . .) = 1.
Such an event may be termed a compound event, in relation to the simple
events x, y, z, which its conception involves. Thus, if x represent the event “It
rains,” y the event “It thunders,” the separate occurrences of those events being
expressed by the logical equations
x = 1, y = 1,
then will x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) represent the event or state of things denoted by
the Proposition, “It either rains or thunders, but not both;” the expression of
that state of things being
x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = 1.
If for brevity we represent the function phi(x, y, z, . . .), used in the above acceptation
by V , it is evident (VI. 13) that the law of duality
V (1 - V ) = 0,
will be identically satisfied.
The simple events x, y, z will be said to be “conditioned” when they are
not free to occur in every possible combination; in other words, when some
compound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring. Thus the
events denoted by the propositions, “It rains,” “It thunders,” are “conditioned”
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 198
if the event denoted by the proposition, “It thunders, but does not rain,” is
excluded from happening, so that the range of possible is less than the range
of conceivable combination. Simple unconditioned events are by definition independent.
Any compound event is similarly said to be conditioned if it is assumed that
it can only occur under a certain condition, that is, in combination with some
other event constituting, by its presence, that condition.
7. We shall proceed in the natural order of thought, from simple and unconditioned,
to compound and conditioned events.
Proposition I.
1st. If p, q, r are the respective probabilities of any unconditioned simple
events x, y, z, the probability of any compound event V will be [V ], this function
[V ] being formed by changing, in the function V , the symbols x, y, z into p, q,
r, &c.
2ndly. Under the same circumstances, the probability that if the event V
occur, any other event V
0 will also occur, will be [V V 0
]
V
, wherein [V V 0
] denotes
the result obtained by multiplying together the logical functions V and V
0
, and
changing in the result x, y, z, &c. into p, q, r, &c.
Let us confine our attention in the first place to the possible combinations of
the two simple events, x and y, of which the respective probabilities are p and
q. The primary combinations of those events (V.11), and their corresponding
probabilities, are as follows:
events. probabilities.
xy, Concurrence of x and y, pq.
x(1 - y), Occurrence of x without y, p(1 - q).
(1 - x)y, Occurrence of y without x, (1 - p)q.
(1 - x)(1 - y), Conjoint failure of x and y, (1 - p)(1 - q).
We see that in these cases the probability of the compound event represented
by a constituent is the same function of p and q as the logical expression of that
event is of x and y; and it is obvious that this remark applies, whatever may
be the number of the simple events whose probabilities are given, and whose
joint existence or failure is involved in the compound event of which we seek
the probability.
Consider, in the second place, any disjunctive combination of the above
constituents. The compound event, expressed in ordinary language as the occurrence
of “either the event x without the event y, or the event y without the
event x” is symbolically expressed in the form x(1 - y) + y(1 - x), and its probability,
determined by Principles iv. and v., is p(1 - q) + q(1 - p). The latter
of these expressions is the same function of p and q as the former is of x and
y. And it is obvious that this is also a particular illustration of a general rule.
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 199
The events which are expressed by any two or more constituents are mutually
exclusive. The only possible combination of them is a disjunctive one, expressed
in ordinary language by the conjunction or, in the language of symbolical logic
by the sign +. Now the probability of the occurrence of some one out of a set
of mutually exclusive events is the sum of their separate probabilities, and is
expressed by connecting the expressions for those separate probabilities by the
sign +. Thus the law above exemplified is seen to be general. The probability
of any unconditioned event V will be found by changing in V the symbols
x, y, z, . . . into p, q, r, . . .
8. Again, by Principle iii., the probability that if the event V occur, the
event V
0 will occur with it, is expressed by a fraction whose numerator is the
probability of the joint occurrence of V and V
0
, and denominator the probability
of the occurrence of V .
Now the expression of that event, or state of things, which is constituted
by the joint occurrence of the events V and V
0
, will be formed by multiplying
together the expressions V and V
0 according to the rules of the Calculus of
Logic; since whatever constituents are found in both V and V
0 will appear in
the product, and no others. Again, by what has just been shown, the probability
of the event represented by that product will be determined by changing
therein x, y, z into p, q, r, . . . Hence the numerator sought will be what [V V 0
] by
definition represents. And the denominator will be [V ], wherefore
Probability that if V occur, V
0 will occur with it = [V V 0
]
[V ]
.
9. For example, if the probabilities of the simple events x, y, z are p, q, r
respectively, and it is required to find the probability that if either x or y occur,
then either y or z will occur, we have for the logical expressions of the antecedent
and consequent—
1st. Either x or y occurs, x(1 - y) + y(1 - x).
2nd. Either y or z occurs, y(1 - z) + z(1 - y).
If now we multiply these two expressions together according to the rules of
the Calculus of Logic, we shall have for the expression of the concurrence of
antecedent and consequent,
xz(1 - y) + y(1 - x)(1 - z).
Changing in this result x, y, z into p, q, r, and similarly transforming the expression
of the antecedent, we find for the probability sought the value
pr(1 - q) + q(1 - p)(1 - r)
p(1 - q) + q(1 - p)
.
The special function of the calculus, in a case like the above, is to supply the
office of the reason in determining what are the conjunctures involved at once
in the consequent and the antecedent. But the advantage of this application is
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 200
almost entirely prospective, and will be made manifest in a subsequent proposition.
Proposition II.
10. It is known that the probabilities of certain simple events x, y, z, . . . are
p, q, r, . . . respectively when a certain condition V is satisfied; V being in expression
a function of x, y, z, . . . . Required the absolute probabilities of the events
x, y, z, . . . , that is, the probabilities of their respective occurrence independently
of the condition V.
Let, p
0
, q
0
, r
0
, &c., be the probabilities required, i. e. the probabilities of the
events x, y, z,.., regarded not only as simple, but as independent events. Then
by Prop. i. the probabilities that these events will occur when the condition V ,
represented by the logical equation V = 1, is satisfied, are
[xV ]
[V ]
,
[yV ]
[V ]
,
[zV ]
[V ]
, &c.,
in which [xV ] denotes the result obtained by multiplying V by x, according to
the rules of the Calculus of Logic, and changing in the result x, y, z, into p
0
,
q
0
, r
0
, &c. But the above conditioned probabilities are by hypothesis equal to
p, q, r, . . . respectively. Hence we have,
[xV ]
[V ]
= p,
[yV ]
[V ]
= q,
[zV ]
[V ]
= r, &c.,
from which system of equations equal in number to the quantities p
0
, q0
, r0
, . . . ,
the values of those quantities may be determined.
Now xV consists simply of those constituents in V of which x is a factor.
Let this sum be represented by Vx, and in like manner let yV be represented by
V y, &c. Our equations then assume the form
[Vx]
[V ]
= p,
[Vy]
[V ]
= q, &c.,
where [Vx] denotes the results obtained by changing in Vx the symbols x, y, z,
&c., into p
0
, q
0
, r
0
, &c.
To render the meaning of the general problem and the principle of its solution
more evident, let us take the following example. Suppose that in the drawing of
balls from an urn attention had only been paid to those cases in which the balls
drawn were either of a particular colour, “white,” or of a particular composition,
“marble,” or were marked by both these characters, no record having been kept
of those cases in which a ball that was neither white nor of marble had been
drawn. Let it then have been found, that whenever the supposed condition was
satisfied, there was a probability p that a white ball would be drawn, arid a
probability q that a marble ball would be drawn: and from these data alone let
it be required to find the probability that in the next drawing, without reference
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 201
at all to the condition above mentioned, a white ball will be drawn; also the
probability that a marble ball will be drawn.
Here if x represent the drawing of a white ball, y that of a marble ball, the
condition V will be represented by the logical function
xy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y.
Hence we have
Vx = xy + x(1 - y) = x, Vy = xy + (1 - x)y = y;
whence
[Vx] = p; [Vy] = q;
and the final equations of the problem are
p
0
p
0q
0 + p
0(1 - q
0) + q
0(1 - p
0)
= p,
q
0
p
0q
0 + p
0(1 - q
0) + q
0(1 - p
0)
= q;
from which we find
p
0 =
p + q - 1
q
, q0 =
p + q - 1
p
.
It is seen that p
0 and q
0 are respectively proportional to p and q, as by
Professor Donkin’s principle they ought to be. The solution of this class of
problems might indeed, by a direct application of that principle, be obtained.
To meet a possible objection, I here remark, that the above reasoning does
not require that the drawings of a white and a marble ball should be independent,
in virtue of the physical constitution of the balls. The assumption of their
independence is indeed involved in the solution, but it does not rest upon any
prior assumption as to the nature of the balls, and their relations, or freedom
from relations, of form, colour, structure, &c. It is founded upon our total ignorance
of all these things. Probability always has reference to the state of our
actual knowledge, and its numerical value varies with varying information.
Proposition III.
11. To determine in any question of probabilities the logical connexion of
the quæsitum with the data; that is, to assign the event whose probability is
sought, as a logical function of the event whose probabilities are given.
Let S, T, &c., represent any compound events whose probabilities are given,
S and T being in expression known functions of the symbols x, y, z, &c., representing
simple events. Similarly let W represent any event whose probability
is sought, W being also a known function of x, y, z, &c. As S, T, . . . W must
satisfy the fundamental law of duality, we are permitted to replace them by
single logical symbols, s, t, . . . w. Assume then
s = S, t = T, w = W.
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 202
These, by the definition of S, T, . . . W, will be a series of logical equations
connecting the symbols s, t, . . . w, with the symbols x, y, z . . .
By the methods of the Calculus of Logic we can eliminate from the above
system any of the symbols x, y, z, . . . , representing events whose probabilities
are not given, and determine w as a developed function of s, t, &c., and of such
of the symbols x, y, z, &c., if any such there be, as correspond to events whose
probabilities are given. The result will be of the form
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D,
where A, B, C, and D comprise among them all the possible constituents which
can be formed from the symbols s, t, &c., i. e. from all the symbols representing
events whose probabilities are given.
The above will evidently be the complete expression of the relation sought.
For it fully determines the event W, represented by the single symbol w, as a
function or combination of the events similarly denoted by the symbols s, t, &c.,
and it assigns by the laws of the Calculus of Logic the condition
D - 0,
as connecting the events s, t, &c., among themselves. We may, therefore, by
Principle vi., regard s, t, &c., as simple events, of which the combination w,
and the condition with which it is associated D, are definitely determined.
Uniformity in the logical processes of reduction being desirable, I shall here
state the order which will generally be pursued.
12. By (viii. 8), the primitive equations are reducible to the forms
s(1 - S) + S(1 - s) = 0;
t(1 - T) + T(1 - t) = 0; (1)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
w(1 - W) - W(1 - w) = 0;
under which they can be added together without impairing their significance.
We can then eliminate the symbols x, y, z, either separately or together. If the
latter course is chosen, it is necessary, after adding together the equations of the
system, to develop the result with reference to all the symbols to be eliminated,
and equate to 0 the product of all the coefficients of the constituents (vii. 9).
As w is the symbol whose expression is sought, we may also, by Prop. iii.
Chap. ix., express the result of elimination in the form
Ew + E
0
(1 - w) = 0.
E and E0 being successively determined by making in the general system (1),
w = 1 and w = 0, and eliminating the symbols x, y, z, . . . Thus the single
equations from which E and E0 are to be respectively determined become
s(1 - S) + S(1 - s) + t(1 - T) + T(1 - t). . . + 1 - W = 0;
s(1 - S) + S(1 - s) + t(1 - T) + T(1 - t) + W = 0.
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 203
From these it only remains to eliminate x, y, z, &c., and to determine w by
subsequent development. In the process of elimination we may, if needful, avail
ourselves of the simplifications of Props. i. and ii. Chap. ix.
13. Should the data, beside informing us of the probabilities of events,
further assign among them any explicit connexion, such connexion must be
logically expressed, and the equation or equations thus formed be introduced
into the general system.
Proposition IV.
14. Given the probabilities of any system of events; to determine by a general
method the consequent or derived probability of any other event.
As in the last Proposition, let S, T, &c., be the events whose probabilities
are given, W the event whose probability is sought, these being known functions
of x, y, z, &c. Let us represent the data as follows:
Probability of S = p;
Probability of T = q;
(1)
and so on, p, q, &c., being known numerical values. If then we represent the
compound event S by s, T by t, and W by w, we find by the last proposition,
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D; (2)
A, B, C, and D being functions of s, t, &c. Moreover the data (1) are transformed
into
Prob. s = p, Prob. t = q, &c. (3)
Now the equation (2) is resolvable into the system
w = A + qC
D = 0,
)
(4)
q being an indefinite class symbol (VI. 12). But since by the properties of
constituents (V. Prop. iii.), we have
A + B + C + D = 1,
the second equation of the above system may be expressed in the form
A + B + C = 1.
If we represent the function A + B + C by V , the system (4) becomes
w = A + qC; (5)
V = 1. (6)
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 204
Let us for a moment consider this result. Since V is the sum of a series
of constituents of s, t, &c., it represents the compound event in which the
simple events involved are those denoted by s, t, &c. Hence (6) shows that
the events denoted by s, t, &c., and whose probabilities are p, q, &c., have
such probabilities not as independent events, but as events subject to a certain
condition V . Equation (5) expresses w as a similarly conditioned combination
of the same events.
Now by Principle vi. the mode in which this knowledge of the connexion of
events has been obtained does not influence the mode in which, when obtained,
it is to be employed. We must reason upon it as if experience had presented to
us the events s, t, &c., as simple events, free to enter into every combination,
but possessing, when actually subject to the condition V , the probabilities p, q,
&c., respectively.
Let then p
0
, q0
, . . . , be the corresponding probabilities of such events, when
the restriction V is removed. Then by Prop. ii. of the present chapter, these
quantities will be determined by the system of equations,
[Vs]
[V ]
= p,
[Vt]
[V ]
= q, &c.; (7)
and by Prop. i. the probability of the event w under the same condition V will
be
Prob. w =
[A + cC]
[V ]
; (8)
wherein Vs denotes the sum of those constituents in V of which s is a factor,
and [Vs] what that sum becomes when s, t, . . . , are changed into p
0
, q0
, . . . , respectively.
The constant c represents the probability of the indefinite event q;
it is, therefore, arbitrary, and admits of any value from 0 to 1.
Now it will be observed, that the values of,p
0
, q
0
, &c., are determined from
(7) only in order that they may be substituted in (8), so as to render Prob. w
a function of known quantities, p, q, &c. It is obvious, therefore, that instead
of the letters p
0
, q
0
, &c., we might employ any others as s, t, &c., in the same
quantitative acceptations. This particular step would simply involve a change
of meaning of the symbols s, t, &c.—their ceasing to be logical, and becoming
quantitative. The systems (7) and (8) would then become
Vs
V
= p,
Vt
V
= q, &c.; (9)
Prob. w =
A + cC
V
. (10)
In employing these, it is only necessary to determine from (9) s, t, &c., regarded
as quantitative symbols, in terms of p, q, &c., and substitute the resulting values
in (10). It is evident, that s, t, &c., inasmuch as they represent probabilities,
will be positive proper fractions.
The system (9) may be more symmetrically expressed in the form
Vs
p
=
Vt
q
. . . = V. (11)
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 205
Or we may express both (9) and (10) together in the symmetrical system
Vs
p
=
Vt
q
. . . =
A + cC
u
= V ; (12)
wherein u represents Prob. w.
15. It remains to interpret the constant c assumed to represent the probability
of the indefinite event q. Now the logical equation
w = A + qC,
interpreted in the reverse order, implies that if either the event A take place,
or the event C in connexion with the event q, the event w will take place, and
not otherwise. Hence q represents that condition under which, if the event C
take place, the event w will take place. But the probability of q is c. Hence,
therefore, c = probability that if the event C take place the event w will take
place.
Wherefore by Principle ii.,
c =
Probability of concurrence of C and w
Probability of C
.
We may hence determine the nature of that new experience from which the
actual value of c may be obtained. For if we substitute in C for s, t, &c., their
original expressions as functions of the simple events x, y, z, &c., we shall form
the expression of that event whose probability constitutes the denominator of
the above value of c; and if we multiply that expression by the original expression
of w, we shall form the expression of that event whose probability constitutes
the numerator of c, and the ratio of the frequency of this event to that of the
former one, determined by new observations will give the value of c. Let it be
remarked here, that the constant c does not necessarily make its appearance in
the solution of a problem. It is only when the data are insufficient to render
determinate the probability sought, that this arbitrary element presents itself,
and in this case it is seen that the final logical equation (2) or (5) informs us
how it is to be determined.
If that new experience by which c may be determined cannot be obtained,
we can still, by assigning to c its limiting values 0 and 1, determine the limits
of the probability of w. These are
Minor limit of Prob. w =
A
V
.
Superior limit = A+C
V
.
Between these limits, it is certain that the probability sought must lie independently
of all new experience which does not absolutely contradict the past.
If the expression of the event C consists of many constituents, the logical
value of w being of the form
w = A +
0
0
C1 +
0
0
C2 + &c.,
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 206
we can, instead of employing their aggregate as above, present the final solution
in the form
Prob. w =
A + c1C1 + c2C2 + &c.
V
.
Here c1 = probability that if the event C1 occur, the event w will occur, and
so on for the others. Convenience must decide which form is to be preferred.
16. The above is the complete theoretical solution of the problem proposed.
It may be added, that it is applicable equally to the case in which any of the
events mentioned in its original statement are conditioned. Thus, if one of the
data is the probability p, that if the event x occur the event y will occur; the
probability of the occurrence of x not being given, we must assume Prob. x = c
(an arbitrary constant), then Prob. xy = cp, and these two conditions must
be introduced into the data, and employed according to the previous method.
Again, if it is sought to determine the probability that if an event x occur an
event y will occur, the solution will assume the form
Prob. sought = Prob. xy
Prob. x
,
the numerator and denominator of which must be separately determined by the
previous general method.
17. We are enabled by the results of these investigations to establish a
general rule for the solution of questions in probabilities.
General Rule.
Case I.—When all the events are unconditioned.
Form the symbolical expressions of the events whose probabilities are given
or sought.
Equate such of those expressions as relate to compound events to a new
series of symbols, s, t, &c., which symbols regard as representing the events, no
longer as compound but simple, to whose expressions they have been equated.
Eliminate from the equations thus formed all the logical symbols, except
those which express events, s, t, &c., whose respective probabilities p, q, &c.
are given, or the event w whose probability is sought, and determine w as a
developed function of s, t, &c. in the form
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D.
Let A + B + C = V , and let Vs represent the aggregate of those constituents in
V which contain s as a factor, Vt of those which contain t as a factor, and thus
for all the symbols whose probabilities are given.
Then, passing from Logic to Algebra, form the equations
Vs
p
=
Vt
q
= V, (1)
Prob. w =
A + cC
V
, (2)
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 207
from (1) determine s, t, &c. as functions of p, q, &c., and substitute their values
in (2). The result will express the solution required.
Or form the symmetrical system of equations
Vs
p
=
Vt
q
. . . =
A + cC
u
=
V
1
, (3)
where u represents the probability sought.
If c appear in the solution, its interpretation will be
c =
Prob. Cw
Prob. c
,
and this interpretation indicates the nature of the experience which is necessary
for its discovery.
Case II.—When some of the events are conditioned.
If there be given the probability p that if the event X occur, the event Y
will occur, and if the probability of the antecedent X be not given, resolve the
proposition into the two following, viz.:
Probability of X = c,
Probability of XY = cp.
If the quæsitum be the probability that if the event W occur, the event Z will
occur, determine separately, by the previous case, the terms of the fraction
Prob. W Z
Prob. W
,
and the fraction itself will express the probability sought.
It is understood in this case that X, Y , W, Z may be any compound events
whatsoever. The expressions XY and W Z represent the products of the symbolical
expressions of X and Y and of W and Z, formed according to the rules
of the Calculus of Logic.
The determination of the single constant c may in certain cases be resolved
into, or replaced by, the determination of a series of arbitrary constants c1, c2 . . .
according to convenience, as previously explained.
18. It has been stated (I. 12) that there exist two distinct definitions, or
modes of conception, upon which the theory of probabilities may be made to
depend, one of them being connected more immediately with Number, the other
more directly with Logic. We have now considered the consequences which flow
from the numerical definition, and have shown how it conducts us to a point
in which the necessity of a connexion with Logic obviously suggests itself. We
have seen to some extent what is the nature of that connexion; and further,
in what manner the peculiar processes of Logic, and the more familiar ones
of quantitative Algebra, are involved in the same general method of solution,
each of these so accomplishing its own object that the two processes may be
regarded as supplementary to each other. It remains to institute the reverse
order of investigation, and, setting out from a definition of probability in which
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 208
the logical relation is more immediately involved, to show how the numerical
definition would thence arise, and how the same general method, equally dependent
upon both elements, would finally, but by a different order of procedure,
be established.
That between the symbolical expressions of the logical calculus and those of
Algebra there exists a close analogy, is a fact to which attention has frequently
been directed in the course of the present treatise. It might even be said that
they possess a community of forms, and, to a very considerable degree, a community
of laws. With a single exception in the latter respect, their difference is
only one of interpretation. Thus the same expression admits of a logical or of
a quantitative interpretation, according to the particular meaning which we attach
to the symbols it involves. The expression xy represents, under the former
condition, a concurrence of the events denoted by x and y; under the latter,
the product of the numbers or quantities denoted by x and y. And thus every
expression denoting an event, simple or compound, admits, under another system
of interpretation, of a meaning purely quantitative. Here then arises the
question, whether there exists any principle of transition, in accordance with
which the logical and the numerical interpretations of the same symbolical expression
shall have an intelligible connexion. And to this question the following
considerations afford an answer.
19. Let it be granted that there exists such a feeling as expectation, a feeling
of which the object is the occurrence of events, and which admits of differing
degrees of intensity. Let it also be granted that this feeling of expectation accompanies
our knowledge of the circumstances under which events are produced,
and that it varies with the degree and kind of that knowledge. Then, without
assuming, or tacitly implying, that the intensity of the feeling of expectation,
viewed as a mental emotion, admits of precise numerical measurement, it is perfectly
legitimate to inquire into the possibility of a mode of numerical estimation
which shall, at least, satisfy these following conditions, viz., that the numerical
value which it assigns shall increase when the known circumstances of an event
are felt to justify a stronger expectation, shall diminish when they demand a
weaker expectation, and shall remain constant when they obviously require an
equal degree of expectation.
Now these conditions at least will be satisfied, if we assume the fundamental
principle of expectation to be this, viz., that the laws for the expression of
expectation, viewed as a numerical element, shall be the same as the laws for the
expression of the expected event viewed as a logical element. Thus if f(x, y, z)
represent any unconditional event compounded in any manner of the events x,
y, z, let the same expression f(x, y, z), according to the above principle, denote
the expectation of that event; x, y, z representing no longer the simple events
involved, but the expectations of those events.
For, in the first place, it is evident that, under this hypothesis, the probability
of the occurrence of some one of a set of mutually exclusive events will be equal
to the sum of the separate probabilities of those events. Thus if the alternation
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 209
in question consist of n mutually exclusive events whose expressions are
f1(x, y, z), f2(x, y, z), . . . fn(x, y, z),
the expression of that alternation will be
f1(x, y, z) + f2(x, y, z). . . + fn(x, y, z) = 1;
the literal symbols x, y, z being logical, and relating to the simple events of which
the three alternatives are compounded: and, by hypothesis, the expression of
the probability that some one of those alternatives will occur is
f1(x, y, z) + f2(x, y, z). . . + fn(x, y, z),
x, y, z here denoting the probabilities of the above simple events. Now this
expression increases, cæteris paribus, with the increase of the number of the
alternatives which are involved, and diminishes with the diminution of their
number; which is agreeable to the condition stated.
Furthermore, if we set out from the above hypothetical definition of the
measure of probability, we shall be conducted, either by necessary inference or
by successive steps of suggestion, which might perhaps be termed necessary, to
the received numerical definition. We are at once led to recognise unity (1) as
the proper numerical measure of certainty. For it is certain that any event x or
its contrary 1 - x will occur. The expression of this proposition is
x + (1 - x) = 1,
whence, by hypothesis, x + (1 - x), the measure of the probability of the above
proposition, becomes the measure of certainty. But the value of that expression
is 1, whatever the particular value of x may be. Unity, or 1, is therefore, on the
hypothesis in question, the measure of certainty.
Let there, in the next place, be n mutually exclusive, but equally possible
events, which we will represent by t1, t2, . . . tn. The proposition which affirms
that some one of these must occur will be expressed by the equation
t1 + t2 . . . + tn = 1;
and, as when we pass in accordance with the reasoning of the last section to
numerical probabilities, the same equation remains true in form, and as the
probabilities t1, t2 . . . tn are equal, we have
nt1 = 1,
whence tl =
1
n
, and similarly t2 =
1
n
, tn =
1
n
. Suppose it then required to
determine the probability that some one event of the partial series t1, t2 . . . tm
will occur, we have for the expression required
t1 + t2 . . . + tm =
1
n
+
1
m
. . . to m terms
=
m
n
.
CHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 210
Hence, therefore, if there are m cases favourable to the occurrence of a particular
alternation of events out of n possible and equally probable cases, the probability
of the occurrence of that alternation will be expressed by the fraction m
n
.
Now the occurrence of any event which may happen in different equally
possible ways is really equivalent to the occurrence of an alternation, i.e., of some
one out of a set of alternatives. Hence the probability of the occurrence of any
event may be expressed by a fraction whose numerator represents the number of
cases favourable to its occurrence, and denominator the total number of equally
possible cases. But this is the rigorous numerical definition of the measure of
probability. That definition is therefore involved in the more peculiarly logical
definition, the consequences of which we have endeavoured to trace.
20. From the above investigations it clearly appears, 1st, that whether we
set out from the ordinary numerical definition of the measure of probability,
or from the definition which assigns to the numerical measure of probability
such a law of value as shall establish a formal identity between the logical
expressions of events and the algebraic expressions of their values, we shall be
led to the same system of practical results. 2ndly, that either of these definitions
pursued to its consequences, and considered in connexion with the relations
which it inseparably involves, conducts us, by inference or suggestion, to the
other definition. To a scientific view of the theory of probabilities it is essential
that both principles should be viewed together, in their mutual bearing and
dependence.
Chapter XVIII
ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE GENERAL
METHOD IN PROBABILITIES.
1. It is designed here to illustrate, by elementary examples, the general method
demonstrated in the last chapter. The examples chosen will be chiefly such as,
from their simplicity, permit a ready verification of the solutions obtained. But
some intimations will appear of a higher class of problems, hereafter to be more
fully considered, the analysis of which would be incomplete without the aid of a
distinct method determining the necessary conditions among their data, in order
that they may represent a possible experience, and assigning the corresponding
limits of the final solutions. The fuller consideration of that method, and of its
applications, is reserved for the next chapter.
2. Ex. 1.—The probability that it thunders upon a given day is p, the
probability that it both thunders and hails is q, but of the connexion of the
two phænomena of thunder and hail, nothing further is supposed to be known.
Required the probability that it hails on the proposed day.
Let x represent the event—It thunders.
Let y represent the event—It hails.
Then xy will represent the event—It thunders and hails; and the data of the
problem are
Prob., x = p, Prob., xy = q.
There being here but one compound event xy involved, assume, according to
the rule,
xy = u. (1)
Our data then become
Prob., x = p, Prob., u = q; (2)
and it is required to find Prob., y. Now (1) gives
y =
u
x
= ux +
1
0
u(1 - x) + 0(1 - u)x +
0
0
(1 - u)(1 - x).
211
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 212
Hence (XVII. 17) we find
V = ux + (1 - u)x + (1 - u)(1 - x),
Vx = ux + (1 - u)x = x, Vu = ux;
and the equations of the General Rule, viz.,
Vx
p
=
Vu
q
= V.
Prob., y =
A + cC
V
become, on substitution, and observing that A = ux, C = (1 - u)(1 - x), and
that V reduces to x + (1 - u)(1 - x),
x
p
=
ux
q
= x + (1 - u)(1 - x), (3)
Prob., y =
ux + c(1 - u)(1 - x)
x + (1 - u)(1 - x)
, (4)
from which we readily deduce, by elimination of x and u,
Prob., y = q + c(l - p). (5)
In this result c represents the unknown probability that if the event (1-u)(1-x)
happen, the event y will happen. Now (l - u)(l - x) = (l - xy)(1 - x) = 1 - x,
on actual multiplication. Hence c is the unknown probability that if it do not
thunder, it will hail.
The general solution (5) may therefore be interpreted as follows:—The probability
that it hails is equal to the probability that it thunders and hails, q,
together with the probability that it does not thunder, 1 - p, multiplied by the
probability c, that if it does not thunder it will hail. And common reasoning
verifies this result.
If c cannot be numerically determined, we find, on assigning to it the limiting
values 0 and 1, the following limits of Prob., y, viz.:
Inferior limit = q.
Superior limit = q + 1 - p.
3. Ex. 2.—The probability that one or both of two events happen is p, that
one or both of them fail is q. What is the probability that only one of these
happens?
Let x and y represent the respective events, then the data are—
Prob. xy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = p,
Prob. x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y + (1 - x)(1 - y) = q;
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 213
and we are to find
Prob. x(1 - y) + y(1 - x).
Here all the events concerned being compound, assume
xy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = s,
x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y + (1 - x)(1 - y) = t,
x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = w.
Then eliminating x and y, and determining w as a developed function of s and
t, we find
w = st + 0s(1 - t) + 0(1 - s)t +
1
0
(1 - s)(1 - t).
Hence A = st, C = 0, V = st + s(1 - t) + (1 - s)t = s + (1 - s)t, Vs = s, Vt = t;
and the equations of the General Rule (XVII. 17) become
s
p
=
t
q
= s + (1 - s)t, (1)
Prob. w =
st
s + (1 - s)t
;
whence we find, on eliminating s and t,
Prob. w = p + q - 1.
Hence p + q - 1 is the measure of the probability sought. This result may be
verified as follows:—Since p is the probability that one or both of the given
events occur, 1 - p will be the probability that they both fail; and since q is
the probability that one or both fail, 1 - q is the probability that they both
happen. Hence 1 - p + 1 - q, or 2 - p - q, is the probability that they either
both happen or both fail. But the only remaining alternative which is possible
is that one alone of the events happens. Hence the probability of this occurrence
is 1 - (2 - p - q), or p + q - 1, as above. 4. Ex. 3.—The probability that a
witness A speaks the truth is p, the probability that another witness B speaks
the truth is q, and the probability that they disagree in a statement is r. What
is the probability that if they agree, their statement is true?
Let x represent the hypothesis that A speaks truth; y that B speaks truth;
then the hypothesis that A and B disagree in their statement will be represented
by x(1 - y) + y(1 - x); the hypothesis that they agree in statement by xy +
(1 - x)(1 - y), and the hypothesis that they agree in the truth by xy. Hence
we have the following data:
Prob. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = r,
from which we are to determine
Prob. xy
Prob. xy + (1 - x)(1 - y)
.
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 214
But as Prob. x(1-y) +y(1-x) = r, it is evident that Prob. xy + (1-x)(1-y)
will be 1 - r; we have therefore to seek
Prob. xy
1 - r
.
Now the compound events concerned being in expression, x(1 - y) + y(1 - x)
and xy, let us assume
x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = s
xy = w

(1)
Our data then are Prob. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. s = r, and we are to find
Prob. w.
The system (1) gives, on reduction,
{x(1 - y) + y(1 - x)}(1 - s) + s{xy + (1 - x)(1 - y)}
+ xy(1 - w) + w(1 - xy) = 0;
whence
w =
x(1 - y)(1 - s) + y(1 - x)(1 - s) + sxy + s(1 - x)(1 - y) + xy
2xy - 1
=
1
0
xys + xy(1 - s) + 0x(1 - y)s +
1
0
x(1 - y)(1 - s)
+0(1 - x)ys +
1
0
(1 - x)(1 - y)s +
1
0
(1 - x)y(1 - s) (2)
+0(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - s).
In the expression of this development, the coefficient 1
0
has been made to replace
every equivalent form (X. 6). Here we have
V = xy(1 - s) + x(1 - y)s + (1 - x)ys + (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - s);
whence, passing from Logic to Algebra,
xy(1 - s) + x(1 - y)s
p
=
xy(1 - s) + (1 - x)ys
q
=
x(1 - y)s + (1 - x)ys
r
= xy(1 - s) + x(1 - y)s + (1 - x)ys + (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - s).
Prob. w =
xy(1 - s)
xy(1 - s) + x(1 - y)s + (1 - x)ys + (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - s)
,
from which we readily deduce
Prob. w =
p + q - r
2
;
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 215
whence we have
Prob. xy
1 - r
=
p + q - r
2(1 - r)
(3)
for the value sought.
If in the same way we seek the probability that if A and B agree in their
statement, that statement will be false, we must replace the second equation of
the system (1) by the following, viz.:
(1 - x)(1 - y) = w;
the final logical equation will then be
w =
1
0
xys + 0xy(1 - s) + 0x(1 - y)s +
1
0
x(1 - y)(1 - s)
+0(1 - x)ys +
1
0
(1 - x)y(1 - s) + 1
0
(1 - x)(1 - y)s
+(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - s); (4)
whence, proceeding as before, we finally deduce
Prob. w =
2 - p - q - r
2
. (5)
Wherefore we have
Prob. (1 - x)(1 - y)
1 - r
=
2 - p - g - r
2(1 - r)
(6)
for the value here sought.
These results are mutually consistent. For since it is certain that the joint
statement of A and B must be either true or false, the second members of (3)
and (5) ought by addition to make 1. Now we have identically,
p + q - r
2(1 - r)

It is probable, from the simplicity of the results (5) and (6), that they might
easily be deduced by the application of known principles; but it is to be remarked
that they do not fall directly within the scope of known methods. The number
of the data exceeds that of the simple events which they involve. M. Cournot,
in his very able work, “Exposition de la Theorie des Chances,” has proposed,
in such cases as the above, to select from the original premises different sets
of data, each set equal in number to the simple events which they involve, to
assume that those simple events are independent, determine separately from the
respective sets of the data their probabilities, and comparing the different values
thus found for the same elements, judge how far the assumption of independence
is justified. This method can only approach to correctness when the said simple
events prove, according to the above criterion, to be nearly or quite independent;
and in the questions of testimony and of judgment, in which such an hypothesis
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 216
is adopted, it seems doubtful whether it is justified by actual experience of the
ways of men.
5. Ex. 4.—From observations made during a period of general sickness, there
was a probability p that any house taken at random in a particular district was
visited by fever, a probability q that it was visited by cholera, and a probability
r that it escaped both diseases, and was not in a defective sanitary condition
as regarded cleanliness and ventilation. What is the probability that any house
taken at random was in a defective sanitary condition?
With reference to any house, let us appropriate the symbols x, y, z, as follows,
viz.:
The symbol x to the visitation of fever.
y ” cholera.
z defective sanitary condition.
The events whose probabilities are given are then denoted by x, y, and
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z), the event whose probability is sought is z. Assume then,
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = w;
then our data are,
Prob. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. w = r,
and we are to find Prob. z. Now
z =
(1 - x)(1 - y) - w
(1 - x)(1 - y)
=
1
0
xyw +

(1 - x)yw +
0
0
(1 - x)y(1 - w) + 0(1 - x)(1 - y)w
+ (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - w). (1)
The value of V deduced from the above is
V = xy(1 - w) + x(1 - y)(1 - w) + (1 - x)y(1 - w)
+(1 - x)(1 - y)w + (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - w) = 1 - w + w(1 - x)(1 - y);
and similarly reducing Vx, Vy, Vw, we get
Vx = x(1 - w), Vy = y(1 - w), Vw = w(1 - x)(1 - y);
furnishing the algebraic equations
x(1 - w)
p
=
y(1 - w)
q
=
w(1 - x)(1 - y)
r
= 1 - w + w(1 - x)(1 - y). (2)
As respects those terms of the development characterized by the coefficients 0
0
,
I shall, instead of collecting them into a single term, present them, for the sake
of variety (xvii. 18), in the form
0
0
x(1 - w) + 0
0
(1 - x)y(1 - w); (3)
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 217
the value of Prob. z will then be
Prob. z =
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - w) + cx(1 - w) + c
0
(1 - x)y(1w)
1 - w + w(1 - x)(1 - y)
. (4)
From (2) and (4) we deduce
Prob. z =
(1 - p - r)(1 - q - r)
1 - r
+ cp + c
0
q(1 - p - r)
1 - r
,
as the expression of the probability required. If in this result we make c = 0,
and c
0 = 0, we find for an inferior limit of its value (1-p-r)(1-q-r)
1-r
; and if we
make c = 1, c
0 = 1, we obtain for its superior limit 1 - r.
6. It appears from inspection of this solution, that the premises chosen
were exceedingly defective. The constants c and c
0
indicate this, and the corresponding
terms (3) of the final logical equation show how the deficiency is to
be supplied. Thus, since
x(1 - w) = x{1 - (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)} = x,
(1 - x)y(1 - w) = (1 - x)y{1 - (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)} = (1 - x)y,
we learn that c is the probability that if any house was visited by fever its
sanitary condition is defective, and that c
0
is the probability that if any house
was visited by cholera without fever, its sanitary condition was defective.
If the terms of the logical development affected by the coefficient 0
0
had been
collected together as in the direct statement of the general rule, the final solution
would have assumed the following form:
Prob. z =
(1 - p - r)(1 - q - r)
1 - r
+ c

p + q -
pq
1 - r

c here representing the probability that if a house was visited by either or both
of the diseases mentioned, its sanitary condition was defective. This result is
perfectly consistent with the former one, and indeed the necessary equivalence
of the different forms of solution presented in such cases may be formally established.
The above solution may be verified in particular cases. Thus, taking the
second form, if c = 1 we find Prob. z = 1-r, a correct result. For if the presence
of either fever or cholera certainly indicated a defective sanitary condition, the
probability that any house would be in a defective sanitary state would be
simply equal to the probability that it was not found in that category denoted
by z, the probability of which would, by the data, be 1 - r, Perhaps the general
verification of the above solution would be difficult.
The constants p, q, and r in the above solution are subject to the conditions
p + r
=
< 1, q + r
=
< 1.
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 218
7. Ex. 5.—Given the probabilities of the premises of a hypothetical syllogism
to find the probability of the conclusion.
Let the syllogism in its naked form be as follows:
Major premiss: If the proposition Y is true X is true.
Minor premiss: If the proposition Z is true Y is true.
Conclusion: If the proposition Z is true X is true.
Suppose the probability of the major premiss to be p, that of the minor
premiss q.
The data then are as follows, representing the proposition X by x, &c., and
assuming c and c
0 as arbitrary constants:
Prob. y = c, Prob. xy = cp;
Prob. z = c
0
, Prob. yz = c
0
q;
from which we are to determine,
Prob. xz
Prob. z
or
Prob. xz

.
Let us assume,
xy = u, yz = v, xz = w,
then, proceeding according to the usual method to determine w as a developed
function of y, z, w, and v, the symbols corresponding to propositions whose
probabilities are given, we find
w = uzvy + 0u(1 - z)(1 - v)y + 0(1 - u)zvy
+
0

(1 - u)z(1 - v)(1 - y) + 0(1 - u)(1 - z)(1 - v)y

;
and passing from Logic to Algebra,
uzvy + u(1 - z)(1 - v)y

uzvy + (1 - u)zvy + (1 - u)z(1 - v)(1 - y)

=
uzvy + u(1 - z)(1 - v)y + (1 - u)zvy + (1 - u)(1 - z)(1 - v)y
c
= V.
Prob. w =
uzvy + a(1 - u)z(1 - v)(1 - y)
V
,
wherein
V = uzvy + u(1 - z)(1 - v)y + (1 - u)zvy + (1 - u)z(1 - v)(1 - y)
+(1 - u)(1 - z)(1 - v)y + (1 - u)(1 - z)(1 - v)(1 - y),
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 219
the solution of this system of equations gives
Prob. w = c
0
pq + ac0
(1 - q),
whence
Prob. xy
c
0
= pq + a(1 - q),
the value required. In this expression the arbitrary constant a is the probability
that if the proposition Z is true and Y false, X is true. In other words, it is the
probability, that if the minor premiss is false, the conclusion is true.
This investigation might have been greatly simplified by assuming the proposition
Z to be true, and then seeking the probability of X. The data would have
been simply
Prob. y = q, Prob. xy = pq;
whence we should have found Prob. x = pq + a(1 - q). It is evident that under
the circumstances this mode of procedure would have been allowable, but I have
preferred to deduce the solution by the direct and unconditioned application of
the method. The result is one which ordinary reasoning verifies, and which it
does not indeed require a calculus to obtain. General methods are apt to appear
most cumbrous when applied to cases in which their aid is the least required.
Let it be observed, that the above method is equally applicable to the categorical
syllogism, and not to the syllogism only, but to every form of deductive
ratiocination. Given the probabilities separately attaching to the premises of
any train of argument; it is always possible by the above method to determine
the consequent probability of the truth of a conclusion legitimately drawn from
such premises. It is not needful to remind the reader, that the truth and the
correctness of a conclusion are different things.
8. One remarkable circumstance which presents itself in such applications
deserves to be specially noticed. It is, that propositions which, when true, are
equivalent, are not necessarily equivalent when regarded only as probable. This
principle will be illustrated in the following example.
Ex. 6.—Given the probability p of the disjunctive proposition “Either the
proposition Y is true, or both the propositions X and Y are false,” required the
probability of the conditional proposition, “If the proposition X is true, Y is
true.”
Let x and y be appropriated to the propositions X and Y respectively. Then
we have
Prob. y + (1 - x)(1 - y) = p,
from which it is required to find the value of Prob. xy
Prob. x
.
Assumey + (1 - x)(1 - y) = t. (1)
Eliminating y we get
(1 - x)(1 - t) = 0.
whence
x =
0
0
t + 1 - t;
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 220
and proceeding in the usual way,
Prob. x = 1 - p + cp. (2)
Where c is the probability that if either Y is true, or X and Y false, X is true.
Next to find Prob. xy. Assume
xy = w. (3)
Eliminating y from (1) and (3) we get
z(1 - t) = 0;
whence, proceeding as above,
Prob. z = cp,
c having the same interpretation as before. Hence
Prob. xy
Prob. x
=
cp
1 - p + cp
,
for the probability of the truth of the conditional proposition given.
Now in the science of pure Logic, which, as such, is conversant only with
truth and with falsehood, the above disjunctive and conditional propositions are
equivalent. They are true and they are false together. It is seen, however, from
the above investigation, that when the disjunctive proposition has a probability
p, the conditional proposition has a different and partly indefinite probability
cp
1-p+cp
. Nevertheless these expressions are such, that when either of them becomes
1 or 0, the other assumes the same value. The results are, therefore,
perfectly consistent, and the logical transformation serves to verify the formula
deduced from the theory of probabilities.
The reader will easily prove by a similar analysis, that if the probability of
the conditional proposition were given as p, that of the disjunctive proposition
would be 1 - c + cp, where c is the arbitrary probability of the truth of the
proposition X.
9. Ex. 7.—Required to determine the probability of an event x, having
given either the first, or the first and second, or the first, second, and third of
the following data, viz.:
1st. The probability that the event x occurs, or that it alone of the three
events x, y, z, fails, is p.
2nd. The probability that the event y occurs, or that it alone of the three
events x, y, z, fails, is q.
3rd. The probability that the event z occurs, or that it alone of the three
events x, y, z, fails, is r.
solution of the first case.
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 221
Here we suppose that only the first of the above data is given. We have
then,
Prob. {x +

1 - x

yz} = p,
to find Prob. x,
Letx +

1 - x

yz = s,
then eliminating yz as a single symbol, we get,
x

= 0.
Hence
x =

,
whence, proceeding according to the rule, we have
Prob. x = cp, (1)
where c is the probability that if x occurs, or alone fails, the former of the two
alternatives is the one that will happen. The limits of the solution are evidently
0 and p.
This solution appears to give us no information beyond what unassisted
good sense would have conveyed. It is, however, all that the single datum here
assumed really warrants us in inferring. We shall in the next solution see how
an addition to our data restricts within narrower limits the final solution.

Here we assume as our data the equations
Prob. {x +

Prob. {y +

xz} = q.
Let us write


yz = s,
y +

xz = q,

or
x + ¯xyz

= 0;
provided that for simplicity we write ¯x for 1 - x, ¯y for 1 - y, and so on. Now,
writing for 1 - yz its value in constituents, we have

x + ¯xyz
s¯+ sx¯

yz¯ + ¯yz 
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 222
an equation consisting solely of positive terms. In like manner we have from the
second equation,
(y + ¯yxz)t¯+ ty¯(xz¯ + ¯xz + ¯xz¯) = 0;
and from the sum of these two equations we are to eliminate y and z.
If in that sum we make y = 1, z = 1, we get the result ¯s + t¯.
If in the same sum we make y = 1, z = 0, we get the result
xs¯+ sx¯ + t.¯
If in the same sum we make y = 0, z = 1, we get
xs¯+ sx¯ + xt¯+ tx. ¯
And if, lastly, in the same sum we make y = 0, z = 0, we find
xs¯+ sx¯ + tx + tx, ¯ or xs¯+ sx¯ + t.
These four expressions are to be multiplied together. Now the first and third
may be multiplied in the following manner:
(¯s + t¯)(xs¯+ sx¯ + xt¯+ tx¯)
= xs¯+ xt¯+ (¯s + t¯)(sx¯ + tx¯) by (IX. Prop. ii.)
= xs¯+ xt¯+ ¯sxt ¯ + sx¯t.¯ (2)
Again, the second and fourth give by (IX. Prop. i.)
(xs¯+ sx¯ + t¯)(xs¯+ sx¯ + t)
= xs¯+ sx. ¯ (3)
Lastly, (2) and (3) multiplied together give
(xs¯+ sx¯)(xs¯+ sx¯t¯+ xt¯+ tx¯s¯)
= xs¯+ sx¯(sx¯t¯+ xt¯+ tx¯s¯)
= xs¯+ sx¯t.¯
Whence the final equation is
(1 - s)x + s(1 - t)(1 - x) = 0,
which, solved with reference to x, gives
x =
s(1 - t)
s(1 - t) - (1 - s)
=
0
0
st + s(1 - t) + 0(1 - s)t + 0(1 - s)(1 - t),
and, proceeding with this according to the rule, we have, finally,
Prob. x = p(1 - q) + cpq. (4)
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 223
where c is the probability that if the event st happen, x will happen. Now if we
form the developed expression of st by multiplying the expressions for s and t
together, we find—
c = Prob. that if x; and y happen together, or x and z happen together, and
y fail, or y and z happen together, and x fail, the event x will happen.
The limits of Prob. x are evidently p(1 - q) and p.
This solution is more definite than the former one, inasmuch as it contains
a term unaffected by an arbitrary constant.
solution of the third case.
Here the data are—
Prob. {x + (1 - x)yz} = p,
Prob. {y + (1 - y)xz} = q,
Prob. {z + (1 - z)xy} = r.
Let us, as before, write ¯x for 1 - x, &c., and assume
x + ¯xyz = s,
y + ¯yxz = t,
z + ¯zxy = u.
On reduction by (VIII. 8) we obtain the equation
(x + ¯xyz)¯s + sx¯(yz¯ + ¯yz + ¯yz¯)
+ (y + ¯yxz)t¯+ ty¯(zx¯ + xz¯ + ¯xz¯)
+ (z + ¯zxy)¯u + uz¯(xy¯ + ¯xy + ¯xy¯) = 0.
(5)
Now instead of directly eliminating y and z from the above equation, let us,
in accordance with (IX. Prop, iii.), assume the result of that elimination to be
Ex + E
0
(1 - x) = 0,
then E will be found by making in the given equation x = 1, and eliminating y
and z from the resulting equation, and E0 will be found by making in the given
equation x = 0, and eliminating y and z from the result. First, then, making
x = 1, we have
s¯+ (y + ¯yz)t¯+ ty¯z¯ + (z + yz¯)¯u + uy¯z¯ = 0,
and making in the first member of this equation successively y = 1, z = 1, y =
1, z = 0, &c., and multiplying together the results, we have the expression
(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(¯s + t + u),
which is equivalent to
(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(¯s + t + u).
This is the expression for E. We shall retain it in its present form. It has already
been shown by example (VIII. 3), that the actual reduction of such expressions
by multiplication, though convenient, is not necessary.
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 224
Again in (5), making x = 0, we have
yzs¯+ s(yz¯ + ¯yz + ¯yz¯) + yt¯+ ty¯ + zu¯ + uz¯ = 0;
from which, by the same process of elimination, we find for E0
the expression
(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(s + t¯+ u)(s + t + ¯u)(s + t + u).
The final result of the elimination of y and z from (5) is therefore
(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(¯s + t + u)x + (¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(s + t¯+ u)(s + t + ¯u)(s + t + u)(1 - x) = 0.
Whence we have
x =
(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(s + t¯+ u)(s + t + ¯u)(s + t + u)
(¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(s + t¯+ u)(s + t + ¯u)(s + t + u) - (¯s + t¯+ ¯u)(¯s + t + u)

To simplify this system of equations, change s

into s,
t

into t, &c., and after
the change let ? stand for stu + s + t + 1 . We then have
Prob. x =

with the relations
stu + s
p
=
stu + t
q
=
stu + u
r
= stu + s + t + u + 1 = ?. (10)
From these equations we get
stu + s = ?p, (11)
stu + s = ? - t - u - 1,
? ?p = ? - u - t - 1.
u + t = ?(1 - p) - 1.
Similarly,u + s = ?(1 - q) - 1,
ands + t = ?(1 - r) - 1.
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 225
From which equations we find
s =
?(1 + p - q - r) - 1
2
, t =
?(1 + q - r - p) - 1
2
,
u =
?(1 + r - p - q) - 1
2
. (12)
Now, by (10),
stu = ?p - s.
Substitute in this equation the values of s, t, and u above determined, and we
have
{(1 + p - q - r)? - 1}{(1 + q - p - r)? - 1}{(1 + r - p - q)? - 1}
= 4{(p + q + r - 1)? + 1}, (13)
an equation which determines ?. The values of s, t, and u, are then given by
(12), and their substitution in (9) completes the solution of the problem.
10. Now a difficulty, the bringing of which prominently before the reader has
been one object of this investigation, here arises. How shall it be determined,
which root of the above equation ought to taken for the value of ?. To this
difficulty some reference was made in the opening of the present chapter, and it
was intimated that its fuller consideration was reserved for the next one; from
which the following results are taken.
In order that the data of the problem may be derived from a possible experience,
the quantities p, q, and r must be subject to the following conditions:
1 + p - q - r
=
> 0,
1 + q - p - r
=
> 0,
1 + r - p - q
=
> 0.
(14)
Moreover, the value of ? to be employed in the general solution must satisfy the
following conditions:
?
=
>
1
1 + p - q - r
, ?
=
>
1
1 + q - p - r
, ?
=
>
1
1 + r - p - q
. (15)
Now these two sets of conditions suffice for the limitation of the general
solution. It may be shown, that the central equation (13) furnishes but one
value of ?, which does satisfy these conditions, and that value of ? is the one
required.
Let 1 + p - q - r be the least of the three coefficients of ? given above, then
1
1 + p - q - r
will be the greatest of those values, above which we are to show
that there exists but one value of ?. Let us write (13) in the form
{(1 + p - q - r)? - 1}{(1 + q - p - r)? - 1}{(1 + r - p - q)? - 1}
-4{(p + q + r - 1)? + 1} = 0; (16)
CHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 226
and represent the first member by V .
Assume ? =
1
1 + p - q - r
, then V becomes

p + q + r - 1
1 + p - q - r
+ 1

,
which is negative. Let ? = 8, then V is positive and infinite.
Again,
d

d?2
= (1 + p - q - r)(1 + q - p - r){(1 + r - p - q)? - 1}
+ similar positive terms,
which expression is positive between the limits ? =
1
1+p-q-r
and ? = 8.
If then we construct a curve whose abscissa shall be measured by ?, and
whose ordinates by V , that curve will, between the limits specified, pass from
below to above the abscissa ?, its convexity always being downwards. Hence it
will but once intersect the abscissa ? within those limits; and the equation (16)
will, therefore, have but one root thereto corresponding.
The solution is, therefore, expressed by (9), ? being that root of (13) which
satisfies the conditions (15), and s, t, and u being given by (12). The interpretation
of c may be deduced in the usual way.
It appears from the above, that the problem is, in all cases, more or less
indeterminate.
Chapter XIX
OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS.
1. By the term statistical conditions, I mean those conditions which must connect
the numerical data of a problem in order that those data may be consistent
with each other, and therefore such as statistical observations might actually
have furnished. The determination of such conditions constitutes an important
problem, the solution of which, to an extent sufficient at least for the requirements
of this work, I purpose to undertake in the present chapter, regarding it
partly as an independent object of speculation, but partly also as a necessary
supplement to the theory of probabilities already in some degree exemplified.
The nature of the connexion between the two subjects may be stated as follows:
2. There are innumerable instances, and one of the kind presented itself
in the last chapter, Ex. 7, in which the solution of a question in the theory
of probabilities is finally dependent upon the solution of an algebraic equation
of an elevated degree. In such cases the selection of the proper root must
be determined by certain conditions, partly relating to the numerical values
assigned in the data, partly to the due limitation of the element required. The
discovery of such conditions may sometimes be effected by unaided reasoning.
For instance, if there is a probability p of the occurrence of an event A, and a
probability q of the concurrence of the said event A, and another event B, it is
evident that we must have
p
=
> q.
But for the general determination of such relations, a distinct method is required,
and this we proceed to establish.
As derived from actual experience, the probability of any event is the result
of a process of approximation. It is the limit of the ratio of the number of cases
in which the event is observed to occur, to the whole number of equally possible
cases which observation records,–a limit to which we approach the more nearly
as the number of observations is increased. Now let the symbol n, prefixed to
the expression of any class, represent the number of individuals contained in
that class. Thus, x representing men, and y white beings, let us assume
nx = number of men.
nxy = number of white men.
nx(1 - y) = number of men who are not white; and so on.
227
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 228
In accordance with this notation n(1) will represent the number of individuals
contained in the universe of discourse, and n(x)
n(1) will represent the probability
that any individual being, selected out of that universe of being denoted by
n(1), is a man. If observation has not made us acquainted with the total values
of n(x) and n(1), then the probability in question is the limit to which n(x)
n(1)
approaches as the number of individual observations is increased.
In like manner if, as will generally be supposed in this chapter, x represent
an event of a particular kind observed, n(x) will represent the number of occurrences
of that event, n(1) the number of observed events (equally probable) of
all kinds, and n(x)
n(1) , or its limit, the probability of the occurrence of the event x.
Hence it is clear that any conclusions which may be deduced respecting the
ratios of the quantities n(x), n(y), n(1), &c. may be converted into conclusions
respecting the probabilities of the events represented by x, y, &c. Thus, if we
should find such a relation as the following, viz.,
n(x) + n(y) < n(1),
expressing that the number of times in which the event x occurs and the number
of times in which the event y occurs, are together less than the number of
possible occurrences n(1), we might thence deduce the relation,
n(x)
n(1) +
n(y)
n(1) < 1,
orProb. x + Prob. y < 1.
And generally any such statistical relations as the above will be converted into
relations connecting the probabilities of the events concerned, by changing n(1)
into 1, and any other symbol n(x) into Prob. x.
3. First, then, we shall investigate a method of determining the numerical
relations of classes or events, and more particularly the major and minor limits
of numerical value. Secondly, we shall apply the method to the limitation of the
solutions of questions in the theory of probabilities.
It is evident that the symbol n is distributive in its operation. Thus we have
n{xy + (1 - x)(1 - y)} = nxy + n(1 - x)(1 - y)
nx(1 - y) = nx - nxy,
and so on. The number of things contained in any class resolvable into distinct
groups or portions is equal to the sum of the numbers of things found in those
separate portions. It is evident, further, that any expression formed of the logical
symbols x, y, &c. may be developed or expanded in any way consistent with
the laws of the symbols, and the symbol n applied to each term of the result,
provided that any constant multiplier which may appear, be placed outside the
symbol n; without affecting the value of the result. The expression n(1), should
it appear, will of course represent the number of individuals contained in the
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 229
universe. Thus,
n(1 - x)(1 - y) = n(1 - x - y + xy)
= n(1) - n(x) - n(y) + n(xy).
Again,n{xy + (1 - x)(1 - y)} = n(l - x - y + 2xy)
= n(1) - nx - ny + 2nxy).
In the last member the term 2nxy indicates twice the number of individuals
contained in the class xy.
4. We proceed now to investigate the numerical limits of classes whose logical
expression is given. In this inquiry the following principles are of fundamental
importance:
1st. If all the members of a given class possess a certain property x, the
total number of individuals contained in the class x will be a superior limit of
the number of individuals contained in the given class.
2nd. A minor limit of the number of individuals in any class y will be found
by subtracting a major numerical limit of the contrary class, 1 - y, from the
number of individuals contained in the universe.
To exemplify these principles, let us apply them to the following problem:
Problem.—Given, n(1), n(x), and n(y), required the superior and inferior
limits of nxy.
Here our data are the number of individuals contained in the universe of
discourse, the number contained in the class x, and the number in the class y,
and it is required to determine the limits of the number contained in the class
composed of the individuals that are found at once in the class x and in the
class y.
By Principle i. this number cannot exceed the number contained in the class
x, nor can it exceed the number contained in the class y. Its major limit will
then be the least of the two values n(x) and (y).
By Principle ii. a minor limit of the class xy will be given by the expression
n(l) - major limit of {x(l - y) + y(l - x) + (1 - x)(1 - y)}, (1)
since x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) - (1 - x)(1 - y) is the complement of the class xy, i.e.
what it wants to make up the universe.
Now x(1 - y) + (1 - x)(1 - y) = 1 - y. We have therefore for (1),
n(1) - major limit of {1 - y + y1 - x)}
= n(1) - n(l - y) - major limit of y(1 - x).
The major limit of y(l - x) is the least of the two values n(y) and n(1 - x). Let
n(y) be the least, then (2) becomes
n(1) - n(1 - y) - n(y)
= n(1) - n(1) + n(y) - n(y) = 0.
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 230
Secondly, let n(1 - x) be less than n(y), then
major limit of ny(1 - x) = n(1 - x);
therefore (2) becomes
n(1) - n(1 - y) - n(1 - x)
= n(1) - n(1) + n(y) - n(1) + n(x)
= nx + ny - n(1).
The minor limit of nxy is therefore either 0 or n(x) + n(y) - n(1), according
as n(y) is less or greater than n(1 - x), or, which is an equivalent condition,
according as n(x) is greater or less than n(1 - y).
Now as 0 is necessarily a minor limit of the numerical value of any class, it
is sufficient to take account of the second of the above expressions for the minor
limit of n(xy). We have, therefore,
Major limit of n(xy) = least of values n(x) and n(y).
Minor limit of n(xy) = n(x) + n(y) - n(1).
1
Proposition I.
5. To express the major and minor limits of a class represented by any
constituent of the symbols x, y, z, &c., having given the values of n(x), n(y),
n(z), &c., and n(1).
Consider first the constituent xyz.
It is evident that the major numerical limit will be the least of the values
n(x), n(y), n(z).
The minor numerical limit may be deduced as in the previous problem, but
it may also be deduced from the solution of that problem. Thus:
Minor limit of n(xyz) = n(xy) + n(z) - n(1). (1)
Now this means that n(xyz) is at least as great as the expression n(xy)+n(z)-
n(1). But n(xy) is at least as great as n(x) + n(y) - n(1). Therefore n(xyz) is
at least as great as
n(x) + n(y) - n(1) + n(z) - n(1),
or n(x) + n(y) + n(z) - 2n(1).
1The above expression for the minor limit of nxy is applied by Professor De Morgan, by
whom it appears to have been first given, to the syllogistic form:
Most men in a certain company have coats.
Most men in the same company have waistcoats.
Therefore some in the company have coats and waistcoats.
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 231
Hence we have
Minor limit of n(xyz) = n(x) + n(y) + n(z) - 2n(1).
By extending this mode of reasoning we shall arrive at the following conclusions:
1st. The major numerical limit of the class represented by any constituent
will be found by prefixing n separately to each factor of the constituent, and
taking the least of the resulting values.
2nd. The minor limit will be found by adding all the values above mentioned
together, and subtracting from the result as many, less one, times the value of
n(1).
Thus we should have
Major limit of nxy(1 - z) = least of the values nx, ny, and n(1 - z).
Minor limit of nxy(1 - z) = n(x) + n(y) + n(1 - z) - 2n(1)
= nx + n(y) - n(z) - n(1).
In the use of general symbols it is perhaps better to regard all the values
n(x), n(y), n(1 - z), as major limits of n{xy(1 - z)}, since, in fact, it cannot
exceed any of them. I shall in the following investigations adopt this mode of
expression.
Proposition II.
6. To determine the major numerical limit of a class expressed by a series
of constituents of the symbols x, y, z, &c., the values of n(x), n(y), n(z), &c.,
and n(1), being given.
Evidently one mode of determining such a limit would be to form the least
possible sum of the major limits of the several constituents. Thus a major limit
of the expression
n{xy + (1 - x)(1 - y)}
would be found by adding the least of the two values nx, ny, furnished by the
first constituent, to the least of the two values n(1 - x), n(1 - y), furnished by
the second constituent. If we do not know which is in each case the least value,
we must form the four possible sums, and reject any of these which are equal to
or exceed n(1). Thus in the above example we should have
nx + n(l - x) = n(l).
n(x) + n(1 - y) = n(1) + n(x) - n(y).
n(y) + n(l - y) = n(l) + n(y) - n(x).
n(y) + n(1 - y) = n(1).
Rejecting the first and last of the above values, we have
n(1) + n(x) - n(y), and n(1) + n(y) - n(x),
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 232
for the expressions required, one of which will (unless nx = ny) be less than
n(l), and the other greater. The least must of course be taken.
When two or more of the constituents possess a common factor, as x, that
factor can only, as is obvious from Principle i., furnish a single term n(x) in the
final expression of the major limit. Thus if n(x) appear as a major limit in two
or more constituents, we must, in adding those limits together, replace nx + nx
by nx, and so on. Take, for example, the expression n{xy + x(1 - y)z}. The
major limits of this expression, immediately furnished by addition, would be—
1. nx. 4. ny + nx.
2. nx + n(1 - y). 5. ny + n(1 - y).
3. nx + n(z). 6. ny + nz.
Of these the first and sixth only need be retained; the second, third, and fourth
being greater than the first; and the fifth being equal to n(1). The limits are
therefore
n(x) and n(y) + n(z),
and of these two values the last, supposing it to be less than n(1), must be
taken.
These considerations lead us to the following Rule:
Rule.—Take one factor from each constituent, and prefix to it the symbol
n, add the several terms or results thus formed together, rejecting all repetitions
of the same term; the sum thus obtained will be a major limit of the expression,
and the least of all such sums will be the major limit to be employed.
Thus the major limits of the expression
xyz + x(1 - y)(1 - z) + (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)
would be
n(x) + n(1 - y), and n(x) + n(1 - z),
orn(x) + n(1) - n(y), and n(x) + n(1) - n(z).
If we began with n(y), selected from the first term, and took n(x) from the
second, we should have to take n(1 - y) from the third term, and this would
give
n(y) + n(x) + n(1 - y), or n(1) + n(x).
But as this result exceeds n(1), which is an obvious major limit to every class,
it need not be taken into account.
Proposition III.
7. To find the minor numerical limit of any class expressed by constituents
of the symbols x, y, z, having given n(x), n(y), n(z). . . n(1).
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 233
This object may be effected by the application of the preceding Proposition,
combined with Principle ii., but it is better effected by the following method:
Let any two constituents, which differ from one another only by a single
factor, be added, so as to form a single class term as x(1 - y) + xy form x,
and this species of aggregation having been carried on as far as possible, i.e.,
there having been selected out of the given series of constituents as many sums
of this kind as can be formed, each such sum comprising as many constituents
as can be collected into a single term, without regarding whether any of the
said constituents enter into the composition of other terms, let these ultimate
aggregates, together with those constituents which do not admit of being thus
added together, be written down as distinct terms. Then the several minor limits
of those terms, deduced by Prop. I., will be the minor limits of the expression
given, and one only of those minor limits will at the same time be positive.
Thus from the expression xy + (1 - x)y + (1 - x)(1 - y) we can form the
aggregates y and 1 - x, by respectively adding the first and second terms together,
and the second and third. Hence n(y) and n(1 - x) will be the minor
limits of the expression given. Again, if the expression given were
xyz + x(1 - y)z + (1 - x)yz + (l - x)(1 - y)z
+ xy(1 - z) + (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z),
we should obtain by addition of the first four terms the single term z, by addition
of the first and fifth term the single term xy, and by addition of the fourth and
sixth terms the single term (1 - x)(1 - y); and there is no other way in which
constituents can be collected into single terms, nor are there are any constituents
left which have not been thus taken account of. The three resulting terms give,
as the minor limits of the given expression, the values
n(z), n(x) + n(y) - n(1),
andn(1 - x) + n(1 - y) - n(1), or n(1) - n(x) - n(y).
8. The proof of the above rule consists in the proper application of the
following principles:— 1st. The minor limit of any collection of constituents
which admit of being added into a single term, will obviously be the minor
limit of that single term. This explains the first part of the rule. 2nd. The
minor limit of the sum of any two terms which either are distinct constituents,
or consist of distinct constituents, but do not admit of being added together,
will be the sum of their respective minor limits, if those minor limits are both
positive; but if one be positive, and the other negative, it will be equal to the
positive minor limit alone. For if the negative one were added, the value of the
limit would be diminished, i. e. it would be less for the sum of two terms than
for a single term. Now whenever two constituents differ in more than one factor,
so as not to admit of being added together, the minor limits of the two cannot
be both positive. Thus let the terms be xyz and (1 - x)(1 - y)z, which differ in
two factors, the minor limit of the first is n(x + y + z - 2), that of the second
n(1 - x + 1 - y + z - 2), or,
1st. n{x + y - 1 - (1 - z)}. 2nd. n{1 - x - y - (1 - z)}.
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 234
If n(x + y - 1) is positive, n(1 - x - y) is negative, and the second must be
negative. If n(x + y - 1) is negative, the first is negative; and similarly for cases
in which a larger number of factors are involved. It may in this manner be
shown that, according to the mode in which the aggregate terms are formed in
the application of the rule, no two minor limits of distinct terms can be added
together, for either those terms will involve some common constituent, in which
case it is clear that we cannot add their minor limits together,—or the minor
limits of the two will not be both positive, in which case the addition would be
useless.
Proposition IV.
9. Given the respective numbers of individuals comprised in any classes, s,
t, &c. logically defined, to deduce a system, of numerical limits of any other
class w, also logically defined.
As this is the most general problem which it is meant to discuss in the
present chapter, the previous inquiries being merely introductory to it, and the
succeeding ones occupied with its application, it is desirable to state clearly its
nature and design.
When the classes s, t . . . w are said to be logically defined, it is meant that
they are classes so defined as to enable us to write down their symbolical expressions,
whether the classes in question be simple or compound. By the general
method of this treatise, the symbol w can then be determined directly as a
developed function of the symbols s, t, &c. in the form
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D, (1)
wherein A, B, C, and D are formed of the constituents of s, t, &c. How from
such an expression the numerical limits of w may in the most general manner
be determined, will be considered hereafter. At present we merely purpose
to show how far this object can be accomplished on the principles developed
in the previous propositions; such an inquiry being sufficient for the purposes
of this work. For simplicity, I shall found my argument upon the particular
development,
w = st + 0s(1 - t) + 1
0
(1 - s)t +
0
0
(1 - s)(1 - t), (2)
in which all the varieties of coefficients present themselves.
Of the constituent (1 - s)(1 - t), which has for its coefficient 0
0
, it is implied
that some, none, or all of the class denoted by that constituent are found in
w. It is evident that n(w) will have its highest numerical value when all the
members of the class denoted by (1 - s)(1 - f) are found in w. Moreover, as
none of the individuals contained in the classes denoted by s(1 - t) and (1 - s)t
are found in w, the superior numerical limits of w will be identical with those
of the class st + (1 - s)(1 - t). They are, therefore,
ns + n(1 - t) and nt + n(1 - s).
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 235
In like manner a system of superior numerical limits of the development A +
0B +
0
0C +
1
0D, may be found from those of A + C by Prop. 2.
Again, any minor numerical limit of w will, by Principle ii., be given by the
expression
n(1) - major limit of n(1 - w),
but the development of w being given by (1), that of 1 - w will obviously be
1 - w = 0A + B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D.
This may be directly proved by the method of Prop. 2, Chap. x. Hence
Minor limit of n(w) = n(1) - major limit (B + C)
= minor limit of (A + D),
by Principle ii., since the classes A + D and B + C are supplementary. Thus
the minor limit of the second member of (2) would be n(t), and, generalizing
this mode of reasoning, we have the following result:
A system of minor limits of the development
A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D
will be given by the minor limits of A + D.
This result may also be directly inferred. For of minor numerical limits we
are bound to seek the greatest. Now we obtain in general a higher minor limit
by connecting the class D with A in the expression of w, a combination which,
as shown in various examples of the Logic we are permitted to make, than we
otherwise should obtain.
Finally, as the concluding term of the development of w indicates the equation
D = 0, it is evident that n(D) = 0. Hence we have
Minor limit of n(D)
=
< 0,
and this equation, treated by Prop. 3, gives the requisite conditions among the
numerical elements n(s), n(t), &c., in order that the problem may be real, and
may embody in its data the results of a possible experience,
Thus from the term 1
0
(1-s)t in the second member of (2) we should deduce
n(1 - s) + n(t) - n(1) =
< 0,
? n(t)
=
< n(s).
These conclusions may be embodied in the following rule:
10. Rule.—Determine the expression of the class w as a developed logical
function of the symbols s, t, &c. in the form
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D.
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 236
Then will
Maj. lim. w = Maj. lim. A + C.
Min. lim. w = Min. lim. A + D.
The necessary numerical conditions among the data being given by the inequality
Min. lim. D
=
< n(1).
To apply the above method to the limitation of the solutions of questions
in probabilities, it is only necessary to replace in each of the formula n(x) by
Prob. x, n(y) by Prob. y, &c., and, finally, n(1) by 1. The application being,
however, of great importance, it may be desirable to exhibit in the form of a
rule the chief results of transformation.
11. Given the probabilities of any events s, t, &c., whereof another event w
is a developed logical function, in the form
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D,
required the systems of superior and inferior limits of Prob. w, and the conditions
among the data.
Solution.—The superior limits of Prob. (A + C), and the inferior limits of
Prob. (A+ D) will form two such systems as are sought. The conditions among
the constants in the data will be given by the inequality,
Inf. lim. Prob. D
=
< 0.
In the application of these principles we have always
Inf. lim. Prob. x1x2 . . . xn = Prob. x1 + Prob. x2 . . . + Prob. xn - (n - 1).
Moreover, the inferior limits can only be determined from single terms, either
given or formed by aggregation. Superior limits are included in the form
P Prob. x, Prob. x applying only to symbols which are different, and are taken
from different terms in the expression whose superior limit is sought. Thus the
superior limits of Prob. xyz + x(1 - y)(1 - z) are
Prob. x, Prob. y + Prob. (1 - z), and Prob. z + Prob. (1 - y).
Let it be observed, that if in the last case we had taken Prob. z from the first
term, and Prob. (1 - z) from the second,—a connexion not forbidden,—we
should have had as their sum 1, which as a result would be useless because `a
priori necessary. It is obvious that we may reject any limits which do not fall
between 0 and 1.
Let us apply this method to Ex. 7, Case iii. of the last chapter.
The final logical solution is
x =
0
0
stu +

0
stu¯ +

0
stu¯ + st¯u¯

CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 237
the data being
Prob. s = p, Prob. t = q, Prob. u = r.
We shall seek both the numerical limits of x, and the conditions connecting
p, q, and r. The superior limits of x are, according to the rule, given by those
of stu + st¯u¯. They are, therefore,
p, q + 1 - r, r + 1 - q.
The inferior limits of x are given by those of
stu¯ + stu¯ + st¯u¯ + ¯stu.
We may collect the first and third of these constituents in the single term
st¯, and the second and third in the single term su¯. The inferior limits of x must
then be deduced separately from the terms s(1 - t), s(1 - u), (1 - s)tu, which
give
p + 1 - q - 1, p + 1 - r - 1, 1 - p + q + r - 2,
or p - q, p - r, and q + r - p - 1.
Finally, the conditions among the constants p, q, and r, are given by the
terms
stu, st ¯ u, ¯ stu, ¯
from which, by the rule, we deduce
p + 1 - q + r - 2
=
< 0, p + q + 1 - r - 2
=
< 0, 1 - p + q + r - 2
=
< 0.
or 1 + q - p - r
=
> 0, 1 + r - p - q
=
> 0, 1 + p - q - r
=
> 0.
These are the limiting conditions employed in the analysis of the final solution.
The conditions by which in that solution ? is limited, were determined, however,
simply from the conditions that the quantities s, t, and u should be positive.
Narrower limits of that quantity might, in all probability, have been deduced
from the above investigation.
12. The following application is taken from an important problem, the solution
of which will be given in the next chapter. There are given,
Prob. x = c1, Prob. y = c2, Prob. s = c1p1, Prob. t = c2p2,
together with the logical equation
z = stxy + stx¯ y¯ + ¯stxy¯ + 0¯st¯

CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 238
and it is required to determine the conditions among the constants c1, c2, p1,
p2, and the major and minor limits of z.
First let us seek the conditions among the constants. Confining our attention
to the terms whose coefficients are 1
0
, we readily form, by the aggregation of
constituents, the following terms, viz.:
s(1 - x), t(1 - y), sy(1 - t), tx(1 - s);
nor can we form any other terms which are not included under these. Hence
the conditions among the constants are,
n(s) + n(1 - x) - n(1) =
< 0,
n(t) + n(1 - y) - n(1) =
< 0,
n(s) + n(y) + n(1 - t) - 2n(1) =
< 0,
n(t) + n(x) + n(1 - s) - 2n(1) =
< 0.
Now replace n(x) by c1, n(y) by c2, n(s) by c1p1, n(t) by c2p2, and n(1) by
1, and we have, after slight reductions,
c1p1
=
< c1, c2p2
=
< c2,
c1p1
=
< 1 - c2(1 - p2), c2p2
=
< 1 - c1(1 - p1).
Such are, then, the requisite conditions among the constants.
Again, the major limits of z are identical with those of the expression
stxy + s(1 - t)x(1 - y) + (1 - s)t(1 - x)y;
which, if we bear in mind the conditions
n(s)
=
< n(x), n(t)
=
< n(y),
above determined, will be found to be
n(s) + n(t), or, c1p1 + c2p2,
n(s) + n(1 - x), or, 1 - c1(1 - p1)n(t) + n(1 - y), or, 1 - c2(1 - p2).
Lastly, to ascertain the minor limits of z, we readily form from the constituents,
whose coefficients are 1 or 1
0
, the single terms s and t, nor can any
other terms not included under these be formed by selection or aggregation.
Hence, for the minor limits of z we have the values c1p1 and c2p2.
13. It is to be observed, that the method developed above does not always
assign the narrowest limits which it is possible to determine. But it in all
cases, I believe, sufficiently limits the solutions of questions in the theory of
probabilities.
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 239
The problem of the determination of the narrowest limits of numerical extension
of a class is, however, always reducible to a purely algebraical form.2
Thus, resuming the equations
w = A + 0B +
0
0
C +
1
0
D,
let the highest inferior numerical limit of w be represented by the formula an(s)+
bn(t). . . + dn(1), wherein a, b, c, . . . d are numerical constants to be determined,
and s, t, &c., the logical symbols of which A, B, C, D are constituents. Then
an(s) + bn(t). . . + dn(1) = minor limit of A subject
to the condition D = 0.
Hence if we develop the function
as + bt . . . + d,
reject from the result all constituents which are found in D, the coefficients of
those constituents which remain, and are found also in A, ought not individually
to exceed unity in value, and the coefficients of those constituents which remain,
and which are not found in A, should individually not exceed 0 in value. Hence
we shall have a series of inequalities of the form f
=
< 1, and another series of the
form g
=
< 0, f and g being linear functions of a, b, c, &c. Then those values of
a, b . . . d, which, while satisfying the above conditions, give to the function
an(s) + bn(t). . . + dn(1),
its highest value must be determined, and the highest value in question will
be the highest minor limit of w. To the above we may add the relations similarly
formed for the determination of the relations among the given constants
n(s), n(t). . . n(1).
14. The following somewhat complicated example will show how the limitation
of a solution is effected, when the problem involves an arbitrary element,
constituting it the representative of a system of problems agreeing in their data,
but unlimited in their quæsita.
Problem.—Of n events x1 x2 . . . xn, the following particulars are known:
1st. The probability that either the event x1 will occur, or all the events
fail, is p1.
2nd. The probability that either the event x2 will occur, or all the events
fail, is p2. And so on for the others.
It is required to find the probability of any single event, or combination of
events, represented by the general functional form f(x1 . . . xn), or f.
2The author regrets the loss of a manuscript, written about four years ago, in which this
method, he believes, was developed at considerable length. His recollection of the contents is
almost entirely confined to the impression that the principle of the method was the same as
above described, and that its sufficiency was proved. The prior methods of this chapter are,
it is almost needless to say, easier, though certainly less general.
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 240
Adopting a previous notation, the data of the problem are
Prob. (x1 + ¯x1 . . . x¯n) = p1 . . .Prob. (xn + ¯x1 . . . x¯n) = pn.
And Prob. f(x1 . . . xn) is required.
Assume generally
xr + ¯x1 . . . x¯n = sr, (1)
f = w. (2)
We hence obtain the collective logical equation of the problem
Xxr
+ ¯x1 . . . x¯n

s¯r + sr

x¯r - x¯1 . . . x¯n
	 + fw¯ + wf¯ = 0. (3)
From this equation we must eliminate the symbols x1, . . . xn, and determine w
as a developed logical function of s1 . . . sn.
Let us represent the result of the aforesaid elimination in the form
Ew + E
0
(1 - w) = 0;
then will E be the result of the elimination of the same symbols from the
equation
Xxr
+ ¯x1 . . . x¯n

s¯r + sr

x¯r - x¯1 . . . x¯n
	 + 1 - f = 0. (4)
Now E will be the product of the coefficients of all the constituents (considered
with reference to the symbols x1, x2 . . . xn) which are found in the development
of the first member of the above equation. Moreover, f, and therefore
1 - f, will consist of a series of such constituents, having unity for their respective
coefficients. In determining the forms of the coefficients in the development
of the first member of (4), it will be convenient to arrange them in the following
manner:
1st. The coefficients of constituents found in 1 - f.
2nd. The coefficient of ¯x1, x¯2 . . . x¯n, if found in f.
3rd. The coefficients of constituents found in f, excluding the constituent
x¯1, x¯2 . . . x¯n.
The above is manifestly an exhaustive classification.
First then; the coefficient of any constituent found in 1 - f, will, in the
development of the first member of (4), be of the form
1 + positive terms derived from X.
Hence, every such coefficient may be replaced by unity, Prop. i. Chap. ix.
Secondly; the coefficient of ¯x1 . . . x¯n, if found in f, in the development of the
first member of (4) will be
Xs¯r, or ¯s1 + ¯s2 . . . +
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 241
Thirdly; the coefficient of any other constituent, x1 . . . xi
, x¯i+1 . . . x¯n, found
in f, in the development of the first member of (4) will be ¯s1 . . . s¯i+si+1 . . .+sn.
Now it is seen, that E is the product of all the coefficients above determined;
but as the coefficients of those constituents which are not found in f reduce to
unity, E may be regarded as the product of the coefficients of those constituents
which are found in f. From the mode in which those coefficients are formed,
we derive the following rule for the determination of E, viz., in each constituent
found in f, except the constituent ¯x1 x¯2 . . . x¯n, for x1 write ¯s1, for ¯xl write s1,
and so on, and add the results; but for the constituent ¯x1, x¯2 . . . x¯n, if it occur
in f, write ¯s1 + ¯s2 . . . + ¯sn, the product of all these sums is E.
To find E0 we must in (3) make w = 0, and eliminate x1, x2 . . . xn, from the
reduced equation. That equation will be
Xxr
+ ¯x1 . . . + ¯xn

s¯r + sr

x¯r - x¯1 . . . x¯n
	 + f = 0. (5)
Hence E0 will be formed from the constituents in 1-f, i. e. from the constituents
not found in f in the same way as E is formed from the constituents found in
f.
Consider next the equation
Ew + E
0
(1 - w) = 0.
This gives
w =
E0
E0 - E
. (6)
Now E and E0 are functions of the symbols s1, s2 . . . sn. The expansion
of the value of w will, therefore, consist of all the constituents which can be
formed out of those symbols, with their proper coefficients annexed to them, as
determined by the rule of development.
Moreover, E and E0 are each formed by the multiplication of factors, and
neither of them can vanish unless some one of the factors of which it is composed
vanishes. Again, any factor, as ¯s1 . . . + ¯sn can only vanish when all the terms
by the addition of which it is formed vanish together, since in development we
attribute to these terms the values 0 and 1, only. It is further evident, that
no two factors differing from each other can vanish together. Thus the factors
s¯1 + ¯s2 . . . + ¯sn, and s1 + ¯s2 . . . + ¯sn, cannot simultaneously vanish, for the
former cannot vanish unless ¯s1 = 0, or s1 = 1; but the latter cannot vanish
unless s1 = 0.
First, let us determine the coefficient of the constituent ¯s1s¯2 . . . s¯n in the
development of the value of w.
The simultaneous assumption ¯s1 = 1, ¯s2 = 1 . . . s¯n = 1, would cause the
factor s1 + s2 . . . + sn to vanish if this should occur in E or E0
; and no other
factor under the same assumption would vanish; but s1 + s2 . . . + sn does not
occur as a factor of either E or E0
; neither of these quantities, therefore, can
vanish; and, therefore, the expression E
0
E0-E
, is neither 1, 0, nor 0
0
.
Wherefore the coefficient of s¯1 s¯2 . . . s¯n in the expanded value of w, may be
represented by 1
0
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 242
Secondly, let us determine the coefficient of the constituent s1 s2 . . . sn. The
assumptions s1 = 1, s2 = 1, . . . sn = 1, would cause the factor ¯s1 + ¯s2 . . . + ¯sn to
vanish. Now this factor is found in E and not in E0 whenever f contains both
the constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and ¯x1 x¯2 . . . x¯n. Here then E
0
E0-E
becomes E
0
E0 or
1. The factor ¯s1 + ¯s2 . . . + ¯sn is found in E0 and not in E, if f contains neither
of the constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and ¯x1 x¯2 . . . x¯n. Here then E
0
E0-E
becomes 0
-E
or 0. Lastly, the factor ¯s1 + ¯s2 . . . + ¯sn is contained in both E and E0
, if one of
the constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and ¯x1 x¯2 . . . x¯n is found in f, and one is not. Here
then E
0
E0-E
becomes 0
0
.
The coefficient of the constituent s1 s2 . . . sn, will therefore be 1, 0, or 0
0
,
according as f contains both the constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and x¯1 x¯2 . . . x¯n, or
neither of them, or one of them and not the other.
Lastly, to determine the coefficient of any other constituent as s1 . . . si
s¯i+1 . . . s¯n.
The assumptions s1 = 1, . . . si = 1, si+1 = 0, sn = 0, would cause the
factor ¯s1 . . . + ¯si + si+1 . . . + sn to vanish. Now this factor is found in E, if the
constituent x1 . . . xi x¯i+1 . . . x¯n is found in f and in E0
, if the said constituent
is not found in f. In the former case we have E
0
E0-E =
E
0
E0 = 1; in the latter case
we have E
0
E0-E =
0
0-E = 0.
Hence the coefficient of any other constituent s1 . . . si
, s¯i+1 . . . s¯n is 1 or 0
according as the similar constituent x1 . . . xi x¯i+1 . . . x¯n is or is not found in f.
We may, therefore, practically determine the value of w in the following
manner. Rejecting from the given expression of f the constituents x1 x2 . . . xc
and ¯x1 x¯2 . . . x¯n, should both or either of them be contained in it, let the symbols
x1, x2, . . . xn, in the result be changed into s1, s2, . . . sn respectively. Let
the coefficients of the constituents s1 s2 . . . sn and ¯s1 s¯2 . . . s¯n be determined
according to the special rules for those cases given above, and let every other
constituent have for its coefficient 0. The result will be the value of w as a
function of s1, s2, . . . sn.
As a particular case, let f = x1. It is required from the given data to
determine the probability of the event x1.
The symbol x1 expanded in terms of the entire series of symbols x1, x2, . . . xn,
will generate all the constituents of those symbols which have x1 as a factor.
Among those constituents will be found the constituent x1 x2 . . . xn, but not
the constituent ¯x1 x¯2 . . . x¯n.
Hence in the expanded value of x1 as a function of the symbols s1, s2, . . . sn,
the constituent s1 s2 . . . sn will have the coefficient 0
0
, and the constituent
s¯1 s¯2 . . . s¯n the coefficient 1
0
.
If from x1 we reject the constituent x1 x2 . . . xn, the result will be x1 -
x1x2 . . . xn, and changing therein x1 into s1 &c., we have s1 -s1s2 . . . sn for the
corresponding portion of the expression of x1 as a function of s1, s2, . . . sn.
Hence the final expression for x1 is
x1 = s1 - s1s2 . . . sn +
0
0
s1s2 . . . sn +
1
0
s¯1s¯2 . . . s¯n
+ constituents whose coefficients are 0.
(7)
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 243
The sum of all the constituents in the above expansion whose coefficients
are either 1, 0, or 0
0
, will be 1 - s¯1s¯2 . . . s¯n.
We shall, therefore, have the following algebraic system for the determination
of Prob. x1, viz.:
Prob. x1 =
s1 - s1s2 . . . sn + cs1s2 . . . sn
1 - s¯1s¯2 . . . s¯n
, (8)
with the relations
s1
p1
=
s2
p2
. . . =
sn
pn
= 1 - s¯1s¯2 . . . s¯n = ?.
(9)
It will be seen, that the relations for the determination of s1 s2 . . . sn are quite
independent of the form of the function f, and the values of these quantities,
determined once, will serve for all possible problems in which the data are the
same, however the quæsita of those problems may vary. The nature of that
event, or combination of events, whose probability is sought, will affect only the
form of the function in which the determined values of s1 s2 . . . sn are to be
substituted. We have from (9)
s1 = p1?, s2 = p2?, . . . sn = pn?.
Whence
1 - (1 - p1?)(1 - p2?). . .(1 - pn?) = ?.
Or,
1 - ? = (1 - p1?)(1 - p2?). . .(1 - pn?); (10)
from which equation the value of ? is to be determined.
Supposing this value determined, the value of Prob. x1 will be
p1? - (1 - c)p1p2 . . . pn?
n
1 - (1 - p1?)(1 - p2?). . .(1 - pn?)
,
or, on reduction by (10),
Prob. x1 = p1 - (1 - c)p1p2 . . . pn?
n-1
. (11)
Let us next seek the conditions which must be fulfilled among the constants
p1, p2, . . . pn, and the limits of the value of Prob. x1.
As there is but one term with the coefficient 1
0
, there is but one condition
among the constants, viz.,
Minor limit, (1 - s1)(1 - s2). . .(1 - sn)
=
< 0.
Or, n(1 - s1) + n(1 - s2). . . + n(1 - sn) - (n - 1)n(1) =
< 0.
Or, n(1) - n(s1) - n(s2). . . - n(sn)
=
< 0.
Whence p1 + p2 . . . + pn
=
> 1,
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 244
the condition required.
The major limit of Prob. x1 is the major limit of the sum of those constituents
whose coefficients are 1 or 0
0
. But that sum is s1.
Hence,
Major limit, Prob. x1 = major limit s1 = p1.
The minor limit of Prob. x1 will be identical with the minor limit of the expression
s1 - s1s2 . . . sn + (1 - s1)(1 - s2). . .(1 - sn).
A little attention will show that the different aggregates, terms which can
be formed out of the above, each including the greatest possible number of
constituents, will be the following, viz.:
s1(1 - s2), s1(1 - s3), . . . s1(1 - sn), (1 - s2)(1 - s3). . .(1 - sn).
From these we deduce the following expressions for the minor limit, viz.:
p1 - p2, p1 - p3 . . . p1 - pn, 1 - p2 - p3 . . . - pn.
The value of Prob. x1 will, therefore, not fall short of any of these values,
nor exceed the value of p1.
Instead, however, of employing these conditions, we may directly avail ourselves
of the principle stated in the demonstration of the general method in
probabilities. The condition that s1, s2, . . . sn must each be less than unity, requires
that ? should be less than each of the quantities 1
p1
,
1
p2
, . . .
1
pn
. And the
condition that s1, s2, . . . sn, must each be greater than 0, requires that ? should
also be greater than 0. Now p1 p2 . . . pn being proper fractions satisfying the
condition
p1 + p2 . . . + pn > 1,
it may be shown that but one positive value of ? can be deduced from the central
equation (10) which shall be less than each of the quantities 1
p1
,
1
p2
, . . .
1
pn
. That
value of ? is, therefore, the one required.
To prove this, let us consider the equation
(l - p1?)(1 - p2?). . .(1 - pn?) - 1 + ? = 0.
When ? = 0 the first member vanishes, and the equation is satisfied. Let
us examine the variations of the first member between the limits ? = 0 and
? =
1
p1
, supposing p1 the greatest of the values p1 p2 . . . pn. Representing the
first member of the equation by V , we have
dV
d? = -p1(1 - p2?). . .(1 - pn?). . . - pn(1 - p1?). . .(1 - pn-1?) + 1,
which, when ? = 0, assumes the form -p1 - p2 . . . - pn + 1, and is negative in
value.
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 245
Again, we have
d
2V
d?2
= p1p2(1 - p3?)(1 - pn?) + &c.,
consisting of a series of terms which, under the given restrictions with reference
to the value of ?, are positive.
Lastly, when ? =
1
p1
, we have
V = -1 +
1
p1
,
which is positive.
From all this it appears, that if we construct a curve, the ordinates of which
shall represent the value of V corresponding to the abscissa ?, that curve will
pass through the origin, and will for small values of ? lie beneath the abscissa.
Its convexity will, between the limits ? = 0 and ? =
1
p1
be downwards, and
at the extreme limit 1
p1
the curve will be above the abscissa, its ordinate being
positive. It follows from this description, that it will intersect the abscissa once,
and only once, within the limits specified, viz., between the values ? = 0, and
? =
1
p1
.
The solution of the problem is, therefore, expressed by (11), the value of ? being
that root of the equation (10), which lies within the limits 0 and 1
p1
,
1
p2
, . . .
1
pn
.
The constant c is obviously the probability, that if the events x1, x2, . . . xn,
all happen, or all fail, they will all happen.
This determination of the value of ? suffices for all problems in which the data
are the same as in the one just considered. It is, as from previous discussions we
are prepared to expect, a determination independent of the form of the function
f. Let us, as another example, suppose
f = or w = x1(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn). . . + xn(1 - x1). . .(1 - xn-1).
This is equivalent to requiring the probability, that of the events x1, x2, . . . xn
one, and only one, will happen. The value of w will obviously be
w = s1(1 - s2). . .(1 - sn). . . + sn(1 - s1). . .(1 - sn-1) + 1
0
(1 - s1). . .(1 - sn),
from which we should have
Prob. {x1(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn). . . + xn(1 - x1). . .(1 - xn-1)}
=
s1(1 - s2). . .(1 - sn). . . + sn(1 - s1). . .(1 - sn-1)
1 - (1 - s1). . .(1 - sn)
=
p1?(1 - p2?). . .(1 - pn?). . . + pn?(1 - p1?). . .(1 - pn-1?)
?
=
p1(1 - ?)
1 - p1?
+
p2(1 - ?)
1 - p2?
. . . +
pn(1 - ?)
1 - pn?
CHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 246
This solution serves well to illustrate the remarks made in the introductory
chapter (I. 16) The essential difficulties of the problem are founded in the nature
of its data and not in that of its quæsita. The central equation by which ?
is determined, and the peculiar discussions connected therewith, are equally
pertinent to every form which that problem can be made to assume, by varying
the interpretation of the arbitrary elements in its original statement.
Chapter XX
PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE CONNEXION OF
CAUSES AND EFFECTS.
1. So to apprehend in all particular instances the relation of cause and effect, as
to connect the two extremes in thought according to the order in which they are
connected in nature (for the modus operandi is, and must ever be, unknown to
us), is the final object of science. This treatise has shown, that there is special
reference to such an object in the constitution of the intellectual faculties. There
is a sphere of thought which comprehends things only as coexistent parts of a
universe; but there is also a sphere of thought (Chap. xi.) in which they are
apprehended as links of an unbroken, and, to human appearance, an endless
chain—as having their place in an order connecting them both with that which
has gone before, and with that which shall follow after. In the contemplation of
such a series, it is impossible not to feel the pre-eminence which is due, above
all other relations, to the relation of cause and effect.
Here I propose to consider, in their abstract form, some problems in which
the above relation is involved. There exists among such problems, as might
be anticipated from the nature of the relation with which they are concerned,
a wide diversity. From the probabilities of causes assigned `a priori, or given
by experience, and their respective probabilities of association with an effect
contemplated, it may be required to determine the probability of that effect;
and this either, 1st, absolutely, or 2ndly, under given conditions. To such an
object some of the earlier of the following problems relate. On the other hand,
it may be required to determine the probability of a particular cause, or of some
particular connexion among a system of causes, from observed effects, and the
known tendencies of the said causes, singly or in connexion, to the production of
such effects. This class of questions will be considered in a subsequent portion
of the chapter, and other forms of the general inquiry will also be noticed. I
would remark, that although these examples are designed chiefly as illustrations
of a method, no regard has been paid to the question of ease or convenience in
the application of that method. On the contrary, they have been devised, with
whatever success, as types of the class of problems which might be expected to
arise from the study of the relation of cause and effect in the more complex of
its actual and visible manifestations.
247
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 248
2. Problem I.—The probabilities of two causes A1 and A2 are c1 and c2
respectively. The probability that if the cause A1 present itself, an event E
will accompany it (whether as a consequence of the cause A1 or not) is p1, and
the probability that if the cause A2 present itself, that event E will accompany
it, whether as a consequence of it or not, is p2. Moreover, the event E cannot
appear in the absence of both the causes A1 and A2.
1 Required the probability
of the event E.
The solution of what this problem becomes in the case in which the causes
A1, A2 are mutually exclusive, is well known to be
Prob. E = c1p1 + c2p2;
and it expresses a particular case of a fundamental and very important principle
in the received theory of probabilities. Here it is proposed to solve the problem
free from the restriction above stated.
Let us represent
The cause A1 by x.
The cause A2 by y.
The effect E by z.
Then we have the following numerical data:
Prob. x = c1, Prob. y = c2,
Prob. xz = c1p1, Prob. yz = c2p2. (1)
Again, it is provided that if the causes A1, A2 are both absent, the effect E does
not occur; whence we have the logical equation
(1 - x)(1 - y) = v(1 - z).
Or, eliminating v,
z(1 - x)(1 - y) = 0. (2)
Now assume,
xz = s, yz = t. (3)
1The mode in which such data as the above might be furnished by experience is easily
conceivable. Opposite the window of the room in which I write is a field, liable to be overflowed
from two causes, distinct, but capable of being combined, viz., floods from the upper sources
of the River Lee, and tides from the ocean. Suppose that observations made on N separate
occasions have yielded the following results: On A occasions the river was swollen by freshets,
and on P of those occasions it was inundated, whether from this cause or not. On B occasions
the river was swollen by the tide, and on Q of those occasions it was inundated, whether from
this cause or not. Supposing, then, that the field cannot be inundated in the absence of
both the causes above mentioned, let it be required to determine the total probability of its
inundation.
Here the elements a, b, p, q of the general problem represent the ratios
A
N
,
P
A
,
B
N
,
Q
B
,
or rather the values to which those ratios approach, as the value of N is indefinitely increased.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 249
Then, reducing these equations (VIII. 7), and connecting the result with (2),
xz(1 - s) + s(1 - xz) + yz(1 - t) + t(1 - yz) + z(1 - x)(1 - y) = 0. (4)
From this equation, z must be determined as a developed logical function of
x, y, s, and t, and its probability thence deduced by means of the data,
Prob. x = c1, Prob. y = c2, Prob. s = c1p1, Prob. t = c2p2. (5)
Now developing (4) with respect to z, and putting ¯x for 1 - x, ¯y for 1 - y,
and2
so on, we have
(xs¯+ sx¯ + yt¯+ ty¯ + ¯xy¯)z + (s + t)¯z = 0,

From this result we find (XVII. 17),
V = stxy + stx¯ y¯ + ¯stxy¯ + ¯stxy ¯ + ¯stx¯ y¯
+¯st¯xy¯ + ¯st¯x¯y¯
= stxy + stx¯ y¯ + ¯stxy¯ + ¯st.¯
Whence, passing from Logic to Algebra, we have the following system of equations,
u standing for the probability sought:
stxy + stx¯ y¯ + ¯stx¯
c1
=
stxy + ¯stxy¯ + ¯sty¯
c2

from which we must eliminate s, t, x, y, and V .

And thus from the above system of equations we may deduce
st¯ xy¯
u - c1p1
=
stx¯ y¯
u - c2p2
=
s¯t¯
1 - u
= V ;
whence we have, on equating the product of the three first members to the cube
of the last,
ss¯
2
tt¯2xxy¯ y¯
(u - c1p1)(u - c2p2)(1 - u)
= V
3
. (8)
Again, from the system (7) we have
s¯t¯x¯
1 - u - c1 + c1p1
=
s¯t¯y¯
1 - u - c2 + c2p2
=
stxy
c1p1 + c2p2 - u
= V,
whence proceeding as before
ss¯
2
tt¯2xxy¯ y¯
(1 - c1 + c1p1 - u)(1 - c2 + c2p2 - u)(c1p1 + c2p2 - u)
= V
3
. (9)
Equating the values of V
3
in (8) and (9), we have
(u - c1p1)(u - c2p2)(1 - u)
= {1 - c1(1 - p1) - u)}{1 - c2(1 - p2) - u}(c1p1 + c2p2 - u),
which may be more conveniently written in the form
(u - c1p1)(u - c2p2)
c1p1 + c2p2 - u
=
{1 - c1(1 - p1) - u}{1 - c2(1 - p2) - u}
1 - u
. (10)
From this equation the value of u may be found. It remains only to determine
which of the roots must be taken for this purpose.
3. It has been shown (XIX. 12) that the quantity u, in order that it may
represent the probability required in the above case, must exceed each of the
quantities c1p1, c2p2, and fall short of each of the quantities 1 - c1(1 - p1),
1 - c2(1 - p2) and c1p1 + c2p2; the condition among the constants, moreover,
being that the three last quantities must individually exceed each of the two
former ones. Now I shall show that these conditions being satisfied, the final
equation (10) has but one root which falls within the limits assigned. That root
will therefore be the required value of u.
Let us represent the lower limits c1p1, c2p2, by a, b respectively, and the
upper limits 1-c1(1-p1), 1-c2(1-p2) and c1p1+c2p2 by a
0
, b
0
, c
0
respectively.
Then the general equation may be expressed in the form
(u - a)(u - b)(1 - u) - (a
0 - u)(b
0 - u)(c
0 - u) = 0, (11)
or(1 - a
0 - b

)u
2 - {ab - a

b
0 + (1 - a
0 - b
0
)c
0
}u + ab - a
0
b
0
c
0 = 0.
Representing the first member of the above equation by V , we have
d
2V
du2
= 2(1 - a
0 - b
0
). (12)
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 251
Now let us suppose a the highest of the lower limits of u, a
0
the lowest of its
higher limits, and trace the progress of the values of V between the limits u = a
and u = a
0
.
When u = a, we see from the form of the first member of (11) that V is
negative, and when u = a
0 we see that V is positive. Between those limits V
varies continuously without becoming infinite, and d
2V
du2 is always of the same
sign.
Hence if u represent the abscissa V the ordinate of a plane curve, it is
evident that the curve will pass from a point below the axis of u corresponding
to u = a, to a point above the axis of u corresponding to u = a
0
, the curve
remaining continuous, and having its concavity or convexity always turned in
the same direction. A little attention will show that, under these circumstances,
it must cut the axis of u once, and only once.
Hence between the limits u = a, u = a
0
, there exists one value of u, and only
one, which satisfies the equation (11). It will further appear, if in thought the
curve be traced, that the other value of u will be less than a when the quantity
1 - a
0 - b
0
is positive and greater than any one of the quantities a
0
, b
0
, c
0 when
1 - a
0 - b
0
is negative. It hence follows that in the solution of (11) the positive
sign of the radical must be taken. We thus find
u =
ab - a
0
b
0 + (1 - a
0 - b
0
)c
0 +
v
Q
2(1 - a
0 - b

, (13)
where Q = {ab - a
0
b
0 + (1 - a
0 - b
0
)c
0}
2 - 4(1 - a
0 - b
0
)(ab - a
0
b
0
c
0
).
4. The results of this investigation may to some extent be verified. Thus,
it is evident that the probability of the event E must in general exceed the
probability of the concurrence of the event E and the cause A1 or A2. Hence
we must have, as the solution indicates,
u > c1p1, u > c2p2.
Again, it is clear that the probability of the effect E must in general be less
than it would be if the causes A1, A2 were mutually exclusive. Hence
u
=
< c1p1 + c2p2.
Lastly, since the probability of the failure of the effect E concurring with the
presence of the cause A1 must, in general, be less than the absolute probability
of the failure of E, we have
c1(1 - p1)
=
< 1 - u,
? u
=
< 1 - c1(1 - p1).
Similarly,
u
=
< 1 - c2(1 - p2).
And thus the conditions by which the general solution was limited are confirmed.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 252
Again, let p1 = 1, p2 = 1. This is to suppose that when either of the causes
A1, A2 is present, the event E will occur. We have then a = c1, b = c2, a
0 = 1,
b
0 = 1, c
0 = c1 + c2, and substituting in (13) we get
u =
c1c2 - c1 - c2 - 1 + v
{(c1c2 - c1 - c2 - 1)2 + 4(c1c2 - c1 - c2)}
-2
= c1 + c2 - c1c2 on reduction
= 1 - (1 - c1)(1 - c2).
Now this is the known expression for the probability that one cause at least will
be present, which, under the circumstances, is evidently the probability of the
event E.
Finally, let it be supposed that c1 and c2 are very small, so that their product
may be neglected; then the expression for u reduces to c1p1 + c2p2. Now the
smaller the probability of each cause, the smaller, in a much higher degree, is
the probability of a conjunction of causes. Ultimately, therefore, such reduction
continuing, the probability of the event E becomes the same as if the causes
were mutually exclusive.
I have dwelt at greater length upon this solution, because it serves in some
respect as a model for those which follow, some of which, being of a more
complex character, might, without such preparation, appear difficult.
5. Problem II.—In place of the supposition adopted in the previous problem,
that the event E cannot happen when both the causes A1, A2 are absent,
let it be assumed that the causes A1, A2 cannot both be absent, and let the
other circumstances remain as before. Required, then, the probability of the
event E.
Here, in place of the equation (2) of the previous solution, we have the
equation
(1 - x)(1 - y) = 0.
The developed logical expression of z is found to be
z = stxy +

and the final solution is
Prob. E = u;
the quantity u being determined by the solution of the equation
(u - a)(u - b)
a + b - u
=
(a
0 - u)(b
0 - u)
u - a
0 - b

, (1)
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 253
wherein a = c1p1, b = c2p2, a
0 = 1 - c1(1 - p1), b
0 = 1 - c2(1 - p2).
The conditions of limitation are the following:—That value of u must be
chosen which exceeds each of the three quantities
a, b, and a
0 + b
0 - 1,
and which at the same time falls short of each of the three quantities
a
0
, b0
, and a + b.
Exactly as in the solution of the previous problem, it may be shown that the
quadratic equation (1) will have one root, and only one root, satisfying these
conditions. The conditions themselves were deduced by the same rule as before,
excepting that the minor limit a
0 + b
0 - 1 was found by seeking the major limit
of 1 - z.
It may be added that the constants in the data, beside satisfying the conditions
implied above, viz., that the quantities a
0
, b
0
, and a + b, must individually
exceed a, b, and a
0 + b
0 - 1, must also satisfy the condition c1 + c2
=
> 1. This
also appears from the application of the rule.
6. Problem III.—The probabilities of two events A and B are a and b
respectively, the probability that if the event A take place an event E will
accompany it is p, and the probability that if the event B take place, the same
event E will accompany it is q. Required the probability that if the event A
take place the event B will take place, or vice versˆa, the probability that if B
take place, A will take place.
Let us represent the event A by x, the event B by y, and the event E by z.
Then the data are—
Prob. x = a, Prob. y = b.
Prob. xz = ap, Prob. yz = bq.
Whence it is required to find
Prob. xy
Prob. x
or
Prob. xy
Prob. y
.
Let
xy = s, yz = t, xy = w.
Eliminating z, we have, on reduction,
sx¯ + ty¯ + syt¯+ xts¯+ xyw¯ + (1 - xy)w = 0,

CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 254
Hence, passing from Logic to Algebra,
Prob. xy =
xyst + xys¯t¯
V
,
x, y, s, and t being determined by the system of equations
xyst + xys¯ t¯+ xys¯t¯+ xy¯s¯t¯
a
=
xyst + ¯xyst¯ + xys¯t¯+ ¯xys¯t¯
b

=
xyst + ¯xyst¯
bq
= xyst + xys¯ t¯+ ¯xyst¯ + xys¯t¯+ xy¯s¯t¯+ ¯xys¯t¯+ ¯xy¯s¯t¯= V.
To reduce the above system to a more convenient form, let every member be
divided by ¯xy¯s¯t¯, and in the result let
xs
x¯s¯
= m,
yt
y¯t¯
= m0
,
x
x¯
= n,
y
y¯
= n
0
.
We then find
mm0 + m + nn0 + n
a
=
mm0 + m0 + nn0 + n
0
b
=
mm0 + m
ap
=
mm0 + m0
bq
= mm0 + m + m0 + nn0 + n + n
0 + 1.
Also,
Prob. xy =
mm0 + nn0
mm0 + m + m0 + nn0 + n + n0 + 1
.
These equations may be reduced to the form
mm0 + m
ap
=
mm0 + m0
bq =
nn0 + n
a(1 - p)
=
nn0 + n
0
b(1 - q)
= (m + 1)(m0 + 1) + (n + 1)(n
0 + 1) - 1.
Prob. xy =
mm0 + nn0
(m + 1)(m0 + 1) + (n + 1)(n0 + 1) - 1
.
Now assume
(m + 1)(m0 + 1) = µ
? + µ - 1
, (n + 1)(n
0 + 1) = ?
? + µ - 1
. (2)
Then since mm0 +m =
m(m0 + 1)(m + 1)
m + 1
=
mµ
(m + 1)(? + µ - 1), and so on for
the other numerators of the system, we find, on substituting and multiplying
each member of the system by ? + µ - 1, the following results:
mµ
(m + 1)ap
=
m0µ
(m0 + 1)bq =
n?
(n + 1)a(1 - p)
=
n
0?
(n0 + 1)b(1 - q)
= 1.
Prob. xy = (mm0 + nn0
)(? + µ - 1). (3)
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 255
From the above system we have
m
m + 1
=
ap
µ
, whence m =
ap
µ - ap
.
Similarly
m0 =
bq
µ - bq , n =
a(1 - p)
? - a(1 - p)
, n0 =
b(1 - q)
? - b(1 - q)
.
Hence
m + 1 =
µ
µ - ap
, n + 1 =
?
? - a(1 - p), &c.
Substitute these values in (2) reduced to the form
? + µ - 1 =
µ
(m + 1)(m0 + 1) =
?
(n + 1)(n0 + 1),
and we have
? + µ - 1 =
(µ - ap)(µ - bq)
µ
=
{? - a(1 - p)} {? - b(1 - q)}
?
, (4)
Substitute also for m, m0
, &c. their values in (3), and we have
Prob. xy
=

abpq
(µ - ap)(µ - bq)
+
ab(1 - p)(1 - q)
{? - a(1 - p)}{? - b(1 - q)}

(? + µ - 1)
=
abpq
µ
+
ab(1 - p)(1 - q)
?
by (4).
Now the first equation of the system (4) gives
? + µ - 1 = µ - ap - bq +
apbq
µ
, (5)
?
apbq
µ
= ? - 1 + ap + bq.
Similarly,
ab(1 - p)(1 - q)
?
= µ - 1 + a(1 - p) + b(1 - q).
Adding these equations together, and observing that the first member of the
result becomes identical with the expression just found for Prob. xy, we have
Prob. xy = ? + µ + a + b - 2.
Let us represent Prob. xy by u, and let a + b - 2 = m, then
µ + ? = u - m. (6)
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 256
Again, from (5) we have
µ? = abpq - (ap + bq - 1)µ. (7)
Similarly from the first and third members of (4) equated we have
µ? = ab(1 - p)(1 - q) - {a(1 - p) + b(1 - q) - 1}?.
Let us represent ap + bq - 1 by h, and a(1 - p) + b(1 - q) - 1 by h
0
. We find on
equating the above values of µ?,
hµ - h
0
? = ab{pq + (1 - p)(1 - q)}
= ab(p + q - 1).
Let ab(p + q - 1) = l, then
hµ - h
0
? = l. (8)
Now from (6) and (8) we get
µ =
h
0
(u - m) + l
m
, ? =
h(u - m) - l
m
.
Substitute these values in (7) reduced to the form
µ(? + h) = abpq,
and we have
(hu - l){h
0
(u - m) + l} = abpqm2
, (9)
a quadratic equation, the solution of which determines u, the value of Prob. xy
sought.
The solution may readily be put in the form
h =
lh0 + h(h
0m - l) ±
v
[{lh0 - h(h
0m - l)}
2 + 4hh0abpqm2
]
2hh0
.
But if we further observe that
lh0 - h(h
0m - l) = l(h + h
0
) - hh0m = (l - hh0
)m,
since
h = ap + bq - 1, h0 = a(1 - p) + b(1 - q) - 1,
whence
h + h
0 = a + b - 2 = m,
we find
Prob. xy =
lh0 + h(h
0m - l) ± m
v
{(l - hh0
)
2 + 4hh0abpq}
2hh0
. (10)
It remains to determine which sign must be given to the radical. We might
ascertain this by the general method exemplified in the last problem, but it is
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 257
far easier, and it fully suffices in the present instance, to determine the sign
by a comparison of the above formula with the result proper to some known
case. For instance, if it were certain that the event A is always, and the event
B never, associated with the event E, then it is certain that the events A and
B are never conjoined. Hence if p = 1, q = 0, we ought to have u = 0. Now the
assumptions p = 1, q = 0, give
h = a - 1, h0 = b - 1, l = 0, m = a + b - 2.
Substituting in (10) we have
Prob. xy =
(a - 1)(b - 1)(a + b - 2) ± (a + b - 2)(a - 1)(b - 1)
2(a - 1)(b - 1) ,
and3
this expression vanishes when the lower sign is taken. Hence the final
solution of the general problem will be expressed in the form
Prob. xy
Prob. x
=
lh0 + h(h
0m - l) - m
v
{(l - hh0
)
2 + 4hh0abpq}
2ahh0
,
wherein h = ap + bq - 1, h0 = a(1 - p) + b(1 - q) - 1,
l = ab(p + q - 1), m = a + b - 2.
As the terms in the final logical solution affected by the coefficient 1
0
are the
same as in the first problem of this chapter, the conditions among the constants
will be the same, viz.,
ap
=
< 1 - b(1 - q), bq
=
< 1 - a(1 - p).
7. It is a confirmation of the correctness of the above solution that the expression
obtained is symmetrical with respect to the two sets of quantities p, q, and 1-p,
1 - q, i.e. that on changing p into 1 - p, and q into 1 - q, the expression is
unaltered This is apparent from the equation
Prob. xy = ab 
pq
µ
+
(1 - p)(1 - q)
?

employed in deducing the final result. Now if there exist probabilities p, q of the
event E, as consequent upon a knowledge of the occurrences of A and B, there
exist probabilities 1-p, 1-q of the contrary event, that is, of the non-occurrence
of E under the same circumstances. As then the data are unchanged in form,
whether we take account in them of the occurrence or of the non-occurrence of
E, it is evident that the solution ought to be, as it is, a symmetrical function of
p, q and 1 - p, 1 - q.
3The numerator was originally “(a - 1)b - 1)(a + b - 2) . . . ”, and was fixed in 2004 by
Distributed Proofreaders.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 258
Let us examine the particular case in which p = 1, q = 1. We find
h = a + b - 1, h0 = -1, l = ab, m = a + b - 2,
and substituting
Prob. xy
Prob. x
=
-ab + (a + b - 1)(2 - a - b - ab) - (a + b - 2)(ab - a - b + 1)
-2a(a + b - 1)
=
-2ab(a + b - 1)
-2a(a + b - 1) = b.
It would appear, then, that in this case the events A and B are virtually independent
of each other. The supposition of their invariable association with
some other event E, of the frequency of whose occurrence, except as it may be
inferred from this particular connexion, absolutely nothing is known, does not
establish any dependence between the events A and B themselves. I apprehend
that this conclusion is agreeable to reason, though particular examples may appear
at first sight to indicate a different result. For instance, if the probabilities
of the casting up, 1st, of a particular species of weed, 2ndly, of a certain description
of zoophytes upon the sea-shore, had been separately determined, and
if it had also been ascertained that neither of these events could happen except
during the agitation of the waves caused by a tempest, it would, I think, justly
be concluded that the events in question were not independent. The picking up
of a piece of seaweed of the kind supposed would, it is presumed, render more
probable the discovery of the zoophytes than it would otherwise have been. But
I apprehend that this fact is due to our knowledge of another circumstance not
implied in the actual conditions of the problem, viz., that the occurrence of
a tempest is but an occasional phenomenon. Let the range of observation be
confined to a sea always vexed with storm. It would then, I suppose, be seen
that the casting up of the weeds and of the zoophytes ought to be regarded as
independent events. Now, to speak more generally, there are conditions common
to all phænomena,—conditions which, it is felt, do not affect their mutual
independence. I apprehend therefore that the solution indicates, that when a
particular condition has prevailed through the whole of our recorded experience,
it assumes the above character with reference to the class of phænomena over
which that experience has extended.
8. Problem IV.—To illustrate in some degree the above observations, let
there be given, in addition to the data of the last problem, the absolute probability
of the event E, the completed system of data being
Prob. x = a, Prob. y = b, Prob. z = c,
Prob. xz = ap, Prob. yz = bq,
and let it be required to find Prob. xy.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 259
Assuming, as before, xz = s, yz = t, xy = w, the final logical equation is
w = xystz + xys¯t¯z¯ + 0(xys¯ tz¯ + ¯xystz ¯ + xy¯z¯s¯t¯+ xyz¯s¯t¯
+¯xyz¯ s¯t¯+ ¯xy¯z¯s¯t¯)
+ terms whose coefficients are 1
0
.
The algebraic system having been formed, the subsequent eliminations may be
simplified by the transformations adopted in the previous problem. The final
result is
Prob. xy = ab 
pq
c
+
(1 - p)(1 - q)
1 - c

. (2)
The conditions among the constants are
c
=
> ap, c
=
> bq, c
=
< 1 - a(1 - p), c
=
< 1 - b(1 - q).
Now if p = 1, q = 1, we find
Prob. xy =
ab
c
,
c not admitting of any value less than a or b. It follows hence that if the event
E is known to be an occasional one, its invariable attendance on the events x
and y increases the probability of their conjunction in the inverse ratio of its
own frequency. The formula (2) may be verified in a large number of cases. As
a particular instance, let q = c, we find
Prob. xy = ab. (3)
Now the assumption q = c involves, by Definition (Chap. XVI.) the independence
of the events B and E. If then B and E are independent, no relation
which may exist between A and E can establish a relation between A and B;
wherefore A and B are also independent, as the above equation (3) implies.
It may readily be shown from (2) that the value of Prob. z, which renders
Prob. xy a minimum, is
Prob. z =
v
(pq)
v
(pq) + v
(1 - p)(1 - q)
.
If p = q, this gives
Prob. z = p;
a result, the correctness of which may be shown by the same considerations
which have been applied to (3).
Problem V.—Given the probabilities of any three events, and the probability
of their conjunction; required the probability of the conjunction of any
two of them.
Suppose the data to be
Prob. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. z = r, Prob. xyz = m,
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 260
and the quæsitum to be Prob. xy.
Assuming xyz = s, xy = t, we find as the final logical equation,
t = xyzs + xyz¯s¯+ 0(xy¯s¯+ ¯xs¯) + 1
0
(sum of all other constituents);
whence, finally,
Prob. xy =
H -
v
(H2 - 4pqr¯
2 - 4¯pq¯rm¯ )
2¯r
,
wherein
p¯ = 1 - p, &c. H = ¯pq¯+ (p + q)¯r.
This admits of verification when p = 1, when q = 1, when r = 0, and therefore
m = 0, &c.
Had the condition, Prob. z = r, been omitted, the solution would still have
been definite. We should have had
Prob. xy =
pq(1 - m) + (1 - p)(1 - q)m
1 - m
;
and it may be added, as a final confirmation of their correctness, that the above
results become identical when m = pqr.
9. The following problem is a generalization of Problem I., and its solution,
though necessarily more complex, is obtained by a similar analysis.
Problem VI.—If an event can only happen as a consequence of one or more
of certain causes A1, A2, . . . An, and if generally ci represent the probability of
the cause Ai and pi the probability that if the cause Ai exist, the event E will
occur, then the series of values of ci and pi being given, required the probability
of the event E.
4
Let the causes A1, A2, . . . An be represented by x1, x2, . . . xn, and the event
E by z.
Then we have generally,
Prob. xi = ci
, Prob. xiz = cipi
.

It may be proper to remark, that the above problem was proposed to the notice of mathematicians
by the author in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, Nov. 1851,
accompanied by the subjoined observations:
“The motives which have led me, after much consideration, to adopt, with reference to this
question, a course unusual in the present day, and not upon slight grounds to be revived, are
the following:—First, I propose the question as a test of the sufficiency of received methods.
Secondly, I anticipate that its discussion will in some measure add to our knowledge of an
important branch of pure analysis. However, it is upon the former of these grounds alone that
I desire to rest my apology.
“While hoping that some may be found who, without departing from the line of their
previous studies, may deem this question worthy of their attention, I wholly disclaim the
notion of its being offered as a trial of personal skill or knowledge, but desire that it may be
viewed solely with reference to those public and scientific ends for the sake of which alone it
is proposed.”
The author thinks it right to add, that the publication of the above problem led to some
interesting private correspondence, but did not elicit a solution.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 261
Further, the condition that E can only happen in connexion with some one or
more of the causes A1, A2, . . . An establishes the logical condition,
z(1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn) = 0. (1)
Now let us assume generally
xiz = ti
,
which is reducible to the form
xiz(1 - ti) + ti(1 - xiz) = 0,
forming the type of a system of n equations which, together with (1), express
the logical conditions of the problem. Adding all these equations together, as
after the previous reduction we are permitted to do, we have
X{xiz(1 - ti) + ti(1 - xiz)} + z(1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn) = 0, (2)
(the summation implied by P extending from i = 1 to i = n), and this single
and sufficient logical equation, together with the 2n data, represented by the
general equations
Prob. xi = ci
, Prob. ti = cipi
, (3)
constitute the elements from which we are to determine Prob. z.
Let (2) be developed with respect to z. We have
hX{xi(1 - ti) + ti(1 - xi)} + (1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn)
i
z
+
Xti(1 - z) = 0,
whence
z =
P
P
ti
ti -
P{xi(1 - ti) + ti(1 - xi)} - (1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn)
. (4)
Now any constituent in the expansion of the second member of the above equation
will consist of 2n factors, of which n are taken out of the set x1, x2, . . . xn, 1-
x1, 1 - x2, . . . 1 - xn, and n out of the set t1, t2, . . . tn, 1 - t1, 1 - t2 . . . 1 - tn,
no such combination as x1(1 - x1), t1(1 - t1), being admissible. Let us consider
first those constituents of which (1 - t1),(1 - t2). . .(1 - tn) forms the t-factor,
that is the factor derived from the set t1, . . . 1 - t1.
The coefficient of any such constituent will be found by changing t1, t2, . . . tn
respectively into 0 in the second member of (4), and then assigning to
x1, x2, . . . xn their values as dependent upon the nature of the x-factor of
the constituent. Now simply substituting for t1, t2, . . . tn the value 0, the second
member becomes
0
-
Pxi - (1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn)
,
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 262
and this vanishes whatever values, 0, 1, we subsequently assign to x1, x2, . . . xn.
For if those values are not all equal to 0, the term Pxi does not vanish, and
if they are all equal to 0, the term -(1 - x1). . .(1 - xn) becomes -1, so that
in either case the denominator does not vanish, and therefore the fraction does.
Hence the coefficients of all constituents of which (1 - t1). . .(1 - tn) is a factor
will be 0, and as the sum of all possible x-constituents is unity, there will be an
aggregate term 0(1 - t1). . .(1 - tn) in the development of z.
Consider, in the next place, any constituent of which the t-factor is
t1 t2 . . . tr(1 - tr+1). . .(1 - tn), r being equal to or greater than unity. Making
in the second member of (4), t1 = 1, . . . tr = 1, tr+1 = 0, . . . tn = 0, we get the
expression
r
x1 . . . + xr - xr+1 . . . - xn - (1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn)
Now the only admissible values of the symbols being 0 and 1, it is evident
that the above expression will be equal to 1 when x1 = 1 . . . xr = 1, xr+1 =
0, . . . xn = 0, and that for all other combinations of value that expression will
assume a value greater than unity. Hence the coefficient 1 will be applied to all
constituents of the final development which are of the form
x1 . . . xr(1 - xr+1). . .(1 - xn)t1 . . . tr(1 - tr+1). . .(1 - tn),
the x-factor being similar to the t-factor, while other constituents included under
the present case will have the virtual coefficient 1
0
. Also, it is manifest that this
reasoning is independent of the particular arrangement and succession of the
individual symbols.
Hence the complete expansion of z will be of the form
z =
X(XT) + 0(1 - t1)(1 - t2). . .(1 - tn)
+ constituents whose coefficients are 1
0
, (5)
where T represents any t-constituent except (1 - t1). . .(1 - tn), and X the
corresponding or similar constituent of x1 . . . xn. For instance, if n = 2, we shall
have
X(XT) = x1x2t1t2 + x1x¯2t1t¯2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t2,
x¯1, ¯x2, &c. standing for 1 - x1, 1 - x2, &c.; whence
z = x1x2t1t2 + x1x¯2t1t¯2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t2
+0(x1x2t¯1t¯2 + x1x¯2t¯1t¯2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t¯2 + ¯x1x¯2t¯1t¯2)
+ constituents whose coefficients are 1
0
.
(6)
This result agrees, difference of notation being allowed for, with the developed
form of z in Problem I. of this chapter, as it evidently ought to do.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 263
10. To avoid complexity, I purpose to deduce from the above equation (6)
the necessary conditions for the determination of Prob. z for the particular case
in which n = 2, in such a form as may enable us, by pursuing in thought the
same line of investigation, to assign the corresponding conditions for the more
general case in which n possesses any integral value whatever.
Supposing then n = 2, we have
V = x1x2t1t2 + x1x¯2t1t¯2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t2 + x1x2t¯1t¯2 + x1x¯2t¯1t¯2
+¯x1x2t¯1t¯2 + ¯x1x¯2t¯1t¯2.
Prob. z =
x1x2t1t2 + x1x¯2t1t¯2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t2
V
,
the conditions for the determination of x1, t1, &c., being
x1x2t1t2 + x1x¯2t1t¯2 + x1x2t¯1t¯2 + x1x¯2t¯1t¯2
c1
=
x1x2t1t2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t2 + x1x2t¯1t¯2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t¯2
c2
=
x1x2t1t2 + x1x¯2t1t¯2
c1p1
=
x1x2t1t2 + ¯x1x2t¯1t2
c2p2
= V.
Divide the members of this system of equations by ¯x1x¯2t¯1t¯2, and the numerator
and denominator of Prob. z by the same quantity, and in the results
assume
x1t1
x¯1t¯1
= m1,
x2t2
x¯2t¯2
= m2,
x1
x¯1
= n1,
x2
x¯2
= n2; (7)
we find
Prob. z =
m1m2 + m1 + m2
m1m2 + m1 + m2 + n1n2 + n1 + n2 + 1
,
and m1m2 + m1 + n1n2 + n1
c1
=
m1m2 + m2 + n1n2 + n2
c2
=
m1m2 + m1
c1p1
+
m1m2 + m2
c2p2
= m1m2 + m1 + m2 + n1n2 + n1 + n2 + 1, (8)
whence, if we assume,
(m1 + 1)(m2 + 1) = M, (n1 + 1)(n2 + 1) = N, (9)
we have, after a slight reduction,
Prob. z =
M - 1
M + N - 1
,
n1(n2 + 1)
c1(1 - p1)
=
n2(n1 + 1)
c2(1 - p2)
=
m1(m2 + 1)
c1p1
=
m2(m1 + 1)
c2p2
= M + N - 1;
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 264
or,
m1M
(m1 + 1)c1p1
=
m2M
(m2 + 1)c2p2
=
n1N
(n1 + 1)c1(1 - p1)
=
n2N
(n2 + 1)c2(1 - p2)
= M + N - 1.
Now let a similar series of transformations and reductions be performed in
thought upon the final logical equation (5). We shall obtain for the determination
of Prob. z the following expression:
Prob. z =
M - 1
M + N - 1
(10)
wherein
M = (m1 + 1)(m2 + 1). . .(mn + 1),
N = (n1 + 1)(n2 + 1). . .(nn + 1),
m1, . . . , mn, n1, . . . , nn, being given by the system of equations,
m1M
(m1 + 1)c1p1
=
m2M
(m2 + 1)c2p2
. . . =
mnM
(mn + 1)cnpn
=
n1N
(n1 + 1)c1(1 - p1)
. . . =
nnN
(nn + 1)cn(1 - pn)
= M + N - 1.
(11)
Still further to simplify the results, assume
M + N - 1
M
=

µ
,
M + N - 1
N
=
1
?
;
whence
M =

We find

whence

and finally,

µ - cnpn
,
n1 + 1 =
?
? - c1(1 - p1)
, . . . nn + 1 =

? - cn(1 - pn)
.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 265
Substitute these values with those of M and N in (9), and we have
µ
n
(µ - c1p1)(µ - c2p2). . .(µ - cnpn)
=
µ
µ + ? - 1
,
?
n
{? - c1(1 - p1)}{? - c2(1 - p2)} . . . {? - cn(1 - pn)}

,
which may be reduced to the symmetrical form
µ + ? - 1 =
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
µn-1
=
{? - c1(1 - p1)} . . . {? - cn(1 - pn)}
?
n-1
.
(12)
Finally,
Prob. z =
M - 1
M + N - 1
= 1 - ?. (13)
Let us then assume 1 - ? = u, we have then
µ - u =
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
µn-1
=
{1 - c1(1 - p1)} . . . {1 - cn(1 - pn) - u}
(1 - u)
n-1
.
If we make for simplicity
c1p1 = a1, cnpn = an, 1 - c1(1 - p1) = b1, &c.,
the above equations may be written as follows:
µ - u =
(µ - a1). . .(µ - an)
µn-1
, (14)
wherein
µ = u +
(b1 - u). . .(bn - u)
(1 - u)
n-1
. (15)
This value of µ substituted in (14) will give an equation involving only u, the
solution of which will determine Prob. z, since by (13) Prob. z = u. It remains
to assign the limits of u.
11. Now the very same analysis by which the limits were determined in the
particular case in which n = 2, (XIX. 12) conducts us in the present case to
the following result. The quantity u, in order that it may represent the value
of Prob. z, must must have for its inferior limits the quantities a1, a2, . . . an,
and for its superior limits the quantities b1, b2, . . . bn, a1 + a2 . . . + an. We may
hence infer, `a priori, that there will always exist one root, and only one root, of
the equation (14) satisfying these conditions. I deem it sufficient, for practical
verification, to show that there will exist one, and only one, root of the equation
(14), between the limits a1, a2, . . . an, and b1, b2, . . . bn.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 266
First, let us consider the nature of the changes to which µ is subject in (15),
as u varies from a1, which we will suppose the greatest of its minor limits, to b1,
which we will suppose the least of its major limits. When u = a1 it is evident
that µ is positive and greater than a1. When u = b1, we have µ = b1, which
is also positive. Between the limits u = a1, u = b1 it may be shown that µ
increases with u. Thus we have
dµ
du = 1 -
(b2 - u). . .(bn - u)
(1 - u)
n-1
-
(b1 - u)(b3 - u). . .(bn - u)
(1 - u)
n-1
. . .
+(n - 1)(b1 - u)(b2 - u). . .(bn - u)
(1 - u)
n
.
(16)
Now let
b1 - u
1 - u
= x1 . . .
bn - u
1 - u
= xn.
Evidently x1, x2, . . . xn, will be proper fractions, and we have
dµ
du = 1 - x2x3 . . . xn - x1x3 . . . xn . . . - x1x2 . . . xn-1 + (n - 1)x1x2 . . . xn
= 1 - (1 - x1)x2x3 . . . xn - x1(1 - x2)x3 . . . xn . . .
-x1x2 . . . xn-1(1 - xn) - x1x2 . . . xn.
Now the negative terms in the second member are (if we may borrow the
language of the logical developments) constituents formed from the fractional
quantities x1, x2, . . . xn. Their sum cannot therefore exceed unity; whence dµ
du
is positive, and µ increases with u between the limits specified.
Now let (14) be written in the form
(µ - a1). . .(µ - an)
µn-1
- (µ - u) = 0, (17)
and assume u = a1. The first member becomes
(µ - a1)

(µ - a2). . .(µ - an)
µn-1
- 1

, (18)
and this expression is negative in value. For, making the same assumption in
(15), we find
µ - a1 =
(b1 - u). . .(bn - u)
(1 - u)
n-1
= a positive quantity.
At the same time we have
(µ - a2). . .(µ - an)
µn-1
=
µ - a2
µ
. . .
µ - an
µ
,
and since the factors of the second member are positive fractions, that member
is less than unity, whence (18) is negative. Wherefore the assumption u = a1
makes the first member of (17) negative.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 267
Secondly, let u = b1, then by (15) µ = u = b1, and the first member of (17)
becomes positive.
Lastly, between the limits u = a1 and u = b1 the first member of (17)
continuously increases. For the first term of that expression written under the
form
(µ - a1)
µ - a1
µ
. . .
µ - an
µ
increases, since µ increases, and, with it, every factor contained. Again, the
negative term µ - u diminishes with the increase of u, as appears from its value
deduced from (15), viz.,
(b1 - u). . .(bn - u)
(1 - u)
n-1
.
Hence then, between the limits u = a1, u = b1, the first member of (17) continuously
increases, changing in so doing from a negative to a positive value.
Wherefore, between the limits assigned, there exists one value of u, and only
one, by which the said equation is satisfied.
12. Collecting these results together, we arrive at the following solution of
the general problem.
The probability of the event E will be that value of u deduced from the
equation
µ - u =
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
µn-1
, (19)
wherein
µ = u +
{1 - c1(1 - p1) - u} . . . {1 - cn(1 - pn) - u}
(1 - u)
n-1
,
which (value) lies between the two sets of quantities,
c1p1, c2p2, . . . , cnpn and 1 - c1(1 - p1), 1 - c2(1 - p2). . . 1 - cn(1 - pn),
the former set being its inferior, the latter its superior, limits.
And it may further be inferred in the general case, as it has been proved in
the particular case of n = 2, that the value of u, determined as above, will not
exceed the quantity
c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn.
13. Particular verifications are subjoined.
1st. Let p1 = 1, p2 = 1, . . . pn = 1. This is to suppose it certain, that if any
one of the events A1, A2 . . . An happen, the event E will happen. In this case,
then, the probability of the occurrence of E will simply be the probability that
the events or causes A1, A2 . . . An do not all fail of occurring, and its expression
will therefore be 1 - (1 - c1)(1 - c2). . .(1 - cn).
Now the general solution (19) gives
µ - u =
(µ - c1). . .(µ - cn)
µn-1
,
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 268
wherein
µ = u +
(1 - u)
n
(1 - u)
n-1
= 1.
Hence,
1 - u = (1 - c1). . .(1 - cn),
? u = 1 - (1 - c1). . .(1 - cn),
equivalent to the `a priori determination above.
2nd. Let p1 = 0, p2 = 0, pn = 0, then (19) gives
µ - u = µ,
? u = 0,
as it evidently ought to be.
3rd. Let c1, c2 . . . cn be small quantities, so that their squares and products
may be neglected. Then developing the second members of the equation (19),
µ - u =
µ
n - (c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn)µ
n-1
µn-1
= µ - (c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn),
? u = c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn.
Now this is what the solution would be were the causes A1, A2 . . . An mutually
exclusive. But the smaller the probabilities of those causes, the more do
they approach the condition of being mutually exclusive, since the smaller is the
probability of any concurrence among them. Hence the result above obtained
will undoubtedly be the limiting form of the expression for the probability of E.
4th. In the particular case of n = 2, we may readily eliminate µ from the
general solution. The result is
(u - c1p1)(u - c2p2)
c1p1 + c2p2 - u
=
{1 - c1(1 - p1) - u}{1 - c2(1 - p2) - u}
1 - u
,
which agrees with the particular solution before obtained for this case, Problem
i.
Though by the system (19), the solution is in general made to depend upon
the solution of an equation of a high order, its practical difficulty will not be
great. For the conditions relating to the limits enable us to select at once a near
value of u, and the forms of the system (19) are suitable for the processes of
successive approximation.
14. Problem 7.—The data being the same as in the last problem, required
the probability, that if any definite and given combination of the causes
A1, A2, . . . An, present itself, the event E will be realized.
The cases A1, A2, . . . An, being represented as before by x1, x2, . . . xn respectively,
let the definite combination of them, referred to in the statement of the
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 269
problem, be represented by the f(x1, x2 . . . xn) so that the actual occurrence of
that combination will be expressed by the logical equation,
f(x1, x2, . . . xn) = 1.
The data are
Prob. x1 = c1, . . . Prob. xn = cn,
Prob. x1z = c1p1, Prob. xnz = cnpn;
(1)
and the object of investigation is
Prob. f(x1, x2 . . . xn)z
Prob. f(x1, x2 . . . xn)
. (2)
We shall first seek the value of the numerator.
Let us assume,
x1z = t1 . . . xnz = tn, (3)
f(x1, x2 . . . xn)z = w. (4)
Or, if for simplicity, we represent f(x1, x2 . . . xn) by f, the last equation will be
fz = w, (5)
to which must be added the equation
x¯1x¯2 . . . x¯nz = 0. (6)
Now any equation xrz = tr of the system (3) may be reduced to the form
xrzt¯r + tr(1 - xrz) = 0.
Similarly reducing (5), and adding the different results together, we obtain the
logical equation
S{xrzt¯r + tr(1 - xrz)} + ¯x1 . . . x¯nz + fzw¯ + w(1 - fz) = 0, (7)
from which z being eliminated, w must be determined as a developed logical
function of x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tn.
Now making successively z = 1, z = 0 in the above equation, and multiplying
the results together, we have
{S(xrt¯r + ¯xrtr) + ¯x1 . . . x¯n + fw¯ + wf¯} × (Str + w) = 0.
Developing this equation with reference to w, and replacing in the result Ptr+1
by 1, in accordance with Prop. i. Chap. ix., we have
Ew + E
0
(1 - w) = 0;
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 270
wherein
E = S(xrt¯r + trx¯r) + ¯x1 . . . x¯n + f, ¯
E
0 = Str{S(xrt¯r + trx¯r) + ¯x1 . . . x¯n + f}.
And hence
w =
E0
E0 - E
. (8)
The second member of this equation we must now develop with respect to
the double series of symbols x1, x2, . . . xn, t1, t2, . . . tn. In effecting this object, it
will be most convenient to arrange the constituents of the resulting development
in three distinct classes, and to determine the coefficients proper to those classes
separately.
First, let us consider those constituents of which t¯1 . . .t¯n is a factor. Making
t1 = 0 . . . tn = 0, we find
E
0 = 0, E = Sxr + ¯x1 . . . x¯n + f. ¯
It is evident, that whatever values (0, 1) are given to the x-symbols, E does not
vanish. Hence the coefficients of all constituents involving t¯1 . . .t¯n are 0.
Consider secondly, those constituents which do not involve the factor t¯1 . . .t¯n,
and which are symmetrical with reference to the two sets of symbols x1 . . . xn
and t1 . . . tn. By symmetrical constituents is here meant those which would remain
unchanged if x1 were converted into t1, x2 into t2, &c., and vice versˆa.
The constituents x1 . . . xn t1 . . . tn, x¯1 . . . x¯n t¯1 . . .t¯n, &c., are in this sense symmetrical.
For all symmetrical constituents it is evident that
X(xrt¯r + trx¯r)
vanishes. For those which do not involve t¯1 . . .t¯n, it is further evident that
x¯1 . . . x¯n also vanishes, whence
E = f E ¯ 0 = Str(f),
w =
Ptr(f)
Ptr(f) - f¯
.
For those constituents of which the x-factor is found in f the second member
of the above equation becomes 1; for those of which the x-factor is found in f¯
it becomes 0. Hence the coefficients of symmetrical constituents not involving
t¯1 . . .t¯n, of which the x-factor is found in f will be 1; of those of which the
x-factor is not found in f it will be 0.
Consider lastly, those constituents which are unsymmetrical with reference
to the two sets of symbols, and which at the same time do not involve t¯1 . . .t¯n.
Here it is evident, that neither E nor E0
can vanish, whence the numerator
of the fractional value of w in (8) must exceed the denominator. That value
cannot therefore be represented by 1, 0, or 0
0
. It must then, in the logical
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 271
development, be represented by 1
0
. Such then will be the coefficient of this class
of constituents.
15. Hence the final logical equation by which w is expressed as a developed
logical function of x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tn, will be of the form
w =
X
1
(XT) + 0{
X
2
(XT) + t¯1 . . .t¯n} +
1
0
(sum of other constituents),
(9)
wherein P
1
(XT) represents the sum of all symmetrical constituents of which the
factor X is found in f, and P
2
(XT), the sum of all symmetrical constituents of
which the factor X is not found in f,—the constituent ¯x1 . . . x¯n t¯1 . . .t¯n, should
it appear, being in either case rejected.
Passing from Logic to Algebra, it may be observed, that here and in all
similar instances, the function V , by the aid of which the algebraic system of
equations for the determination of the values of x1, . . . xn, t1 . . . tn is formed, is
independent of the nature of any function f involved, not in the expression of
the data, but in that of the quæsitum of the problem proposed. Thus we have
in the present example,
Prob. w =
P
1
(XT)
V
,
wherein V =
X
1
(XT) +X
2
(XT) + t1 . . .t¯n
=
X(XT) + t¯1 . . . tn. (10)
Here P(XT) represents the sum of all symmetrical constituents of the x and t
symbols, except the constituent ¯x1 . . . x¯n, t¯1 . . .t¯n. This value of V is the same
as that virtually employed in the solution of the preceding problem, and hence
we may avail ourselves of the results there obtained.
If then, as in the solution referred to, we assume
x1t1
x¯1t¯1
= m1,
xntn
x¯nt¯n
= mn,
x1
x¯1
= n1, &c.,
we shall obtain a result which may be thus written:
Prob. w =
M1
M + N - 1
, (11)
M1 being formed by rejecting from the function f the constituent x1 . . . x¯n, if
it is there found, dividing the result by the same constituent ¯x1 . . . x¯n and then
changing x1
x¯1
into m1,
x2
x¯2
into m2, and so on. The values of M and N are the
same as in the preceding problem. Reverting to these and to the corresponding
values of m1, m2, &c., we find
Prob. w = M1(µ + ? - 1),
the general values of mr, nr being
mr =
crpr
µ - crpr
, nr =
cr(1 - pr)
µ - cr(1 - pr)
,
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 272
and µ and ? being given by the solution of the system of equations,
µ + ? - 1 =
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
µn-1
=
{? - c1(1 - p1)} . . . {? - cn(1 - pn)}
?
n-1
.
The above value of Prob. w will be the numerator of the fraction (2). It now
remains to determine its denominator.
For this purpose assume
f(x1, x2 . . . xn) = v,
or
f = v;
whence
fv¯ + vf¯ = 0.
Substituting the first member of this equation in (7) in place of the corresponding
form fzw¯ + w(1 - fz) we obtain as the primary logical equation,
X{xrzt¯r + tr(1 - xrz)} + ¯x1 . . . x¯nz + fv¯ + vf¯ = 0,
whence eliminating z, and reducing by Prop. II. Chap. IX.,
fv¯ + vf¯ +
Xtr{
X(xrt¯r + trx¯r) + ¯x1 . . . x¯n} = 0.
Hence
v =
f +
Ptr{
P(xrt¯r + trx¯r) + ¯x1 . . . x¯n}
2f - 1
and developing as before,
v =
X
1
(XT) + t¯1 . . .t¯n
X
1
(X) + 0{
X
2
(XT) + t¯1 . . .t¯n
X
2
(X)}
+
1
0
(sum of other constituents).
(12)
Here P
1
(X) indicates the sum of all constituents found in f,
P
2
(X) the
sum of all constituents not found in f. The expressions are indeed used in place
of f and 1 - f to preserve symmetry.
It follows hence that P
1
(X) + P
2
(X) = 1, and that, as before, P
1
P
(XT) +
2
(XT) = P(XT). Hence V will have the same value as before, and we shall
have
Prob. v =
P
1
(XT) + t¯1 . . .t¯n
P
1
(X)
V
,
Or transforming, as in the previous case,
Prob. v =
M1 + N1
M + N - 1
, (13)
wherein N1 is formed by dividing f by ¯x1 . . . x¯n, and changing in the result
x1
x¯1
into n1,
x2
x¯2
into n2, &c.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 273
Now the final solution of the problem proposed will be given by assigning
their determined values to the terms of the fraction
Prob. f(x1, . . . xn)z
Prob. f(x1, . . . xn)
, or
Prob. w
Prob. v
.
Hence, therefore, by (11) and (13) we have
Prob. sought = M1
M1 + N1
A very slight attention to the mode of formation of the functions M1 and N1
will show that the process may be greatly simplified. We may, indeed, exhibit
the solution of the general problem in the form of a rule, as follows:
Reject from the function f(x1, x2 . . . xn) the constituent x¯1 . . . x¯n if it is
therein contained, suppress in all the remaining constituents the factors x¯1, x¯2,
&c., and change generally in the result xr into crpr
µ-crpr
. Call this result M1.
Again, replace in the function f(x1, x2 . . . xn) the constituent x¯1 . . . x¯n if is
therein found, by unity; suppress in all the remaining constituents the factors
x¯1, x¯2, &c., and change generally in the result xr into cr(1-pr)
?-cr(1-pr)
.
Then the solution required will be expressed by the formula
M1
M1 + N1
, (14)
µ and ? being determined by the solution of the system of equations
µ + ? - 1 =
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
µn-1
=
{? - c1(1 - p1)} . . . {µ - cn(1 - pn)}
?
n-1
. (15)
It may be added, that the limits of µ and ? are the same as in the previous
problem. This might be inferred from the general principle of continuity; but
conditions of limitation, which are probably sufficient, may also be established
by other considerations.
Thus from the demonstration of the general method in probabilities, Chap.
XVII. Prop,iv., it appears that the quantities x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tn in the primary
system of algebraic equations, must be positive proper fractions. Now
xr
1 - xr
= nr =
cr(1 - pr)
? - cr(1 - pr)
.
Hence generally nr must be a positive quantity, and therefore we must have
?
=
> cr(1 - pr).
In like manner since we have
xrtr
(1 - xr)(1 - tr)
= mr =
crpr
µ - crpr
,
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 274
we must have generally
µ
=
> crpr.
16. It is probable that the two classes of conditions thus represented are
together sufficient to determine generally which of the roots of the equations
determining µ and ? are to be taken. Let us take in particular the case in which
n = 2. Here we have
µ + ? - 1 =
(µ - c1p1)(µ - c2 p2)
µ
= µ - (c1p1 + c2p2) + c1p1c2p2
µ
,
? ? = 1 - c1p1 - c2p2 +
c1p1 c2p2
µ
= 1 - c1p1 -
(µ - c1p1)c2p2
µ
.
Whence, since µ
=
> c1p1 we have generally
?
=
< 1 - c1p1.
In like manner we have
?
=
< 1 - c2p2, µ
=
< 1 - c1(1 - p1), µ
=
< 1 - c2(1 - p2).
Now it has already been shown that there will exist but one value of µ
satisfying the whole of the above conditions relative to that quantity, viz.
µ
=
> crpr, µ
=
< 1 - cr(1 - pr),
whence the solution for this case, at least, is determinate. And I apprehend that
the same method is generally applicable and sufficient. But this is a question
upon which a further degree of light is desirable.
To verify the above results, suppose f(x1, . . . xn) = 1, which is virtually the
case considered in the previous problem. Now the development of 1 gives all
possible constituents of the symbols x1, . . . xn. Proceeding then according to
the Rule, we find
M1 =
µ
n
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
- 1 =
µ
µ + ? - 1
- 1 by (15).
N1 =
?
n
{? - c1(1 - p1)} . . . {? - cn(1 - pn)}
- 1 =
?
µ + ? - 1
- 1.
Substituting in (14) we find
Prob. z = 1 - ?,
which agrees with the previous solution.
Again, let f(x1, . . . xn) = x1, which, after development and suppression of
the factors ¯x2, . . . x¯n, gives x1(x2 + 1). . .(xn + 1), whence we find
M1 =
c1p1µ
n-1
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
=
c1p1
µ + ? - 1
by (15).
N1 =
c1(1 - p1)?
n-1
{? - c1(1 - p1)} . . . {? - cn(1 - pn)}
=
c1(1 - p1)
µ + ? - 1
.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 275
Substituting, we have
Probability that if the event A1, occur, E will occur = p1.
And this result is verified by the data. Similar verifications might easily be
added.
Let us examine the case in which
f(x1, . . . xn) = x1x¯2 . . . x¯n + x2x¯1x¯3 . . . x¯n . . . + xnx¯1 . . . x¯n-1.
Here we find
M1 =
c1p1
µ - c1p1
. . . +
cnpn
µ - cnpn
,
N1 =
c1(1 - p1)
? - c1(1 - p1)
. . . +
cn(1 - pn)
? - cn(1 - pn)
;
whence we have the following result—
Probability that if some one
alone of the causes A1, A2 . . . An
present itself, the event E will
follow.
?
??
??
=
P crpr
µ - crpr
P crpr
µ - crpr
+
P cr(1 - pr)
? - cr(1 - pr)
Let it be observed that this case is quite different from the well-known one
in which the mutually exclusive character of the causes A1, . . . An is one of the
elements of the data, expressing a condition under which the very observations
by which the probabilities of A1, A2, &c. are supposed to have been determined,
were made.
Consider, lastly, the case in which f(x1, . . . xn) = x1x2 . . . xn. Here
M1 =
c1p1 . . . cnpn
(µ - c1p1). . .(µ - cnpn)
=
c1p1 . . . cnpn
µn-1(µ + ? - 1),
N1 =
c1(1 - p1). . . cn(1 - pn)
{? - c1(1 - p1)} . . . {? - cn(1 - pn)}
=
c1(1 - p1). . . cn(1 - pn)
?
n-1(µ + ? - 1) .
Hence the following result—
Probability that if all the causes
A1, . . . An conspire, the event E
will follow.
)
=
p1 . . . pn?
n-1
p1 . . . pn?
n-1 + (1 - p1). . .(1 - pn)µn-1
.
This expression assumes, as it ought to do, the value 1 when any one of the
quantities p1, . . . pn is equal to 1.
17. Problem VIII.—Certain causes A1, A2, . . . An being so restricted that
they cannot all fail, but still can only occur in certain definite combinations
denoted by the equation
f(A1, A2 . . . An) = 1,
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 276
and there being given the separate probabilities c1, . . . cn of the said causes, and
the corresponding probabilities p1, . . . pn that an event E will follow if those
respective causes are realized, required the probability of the event E.
This problem differs from the one last considered in several particulars, but
chiefly in this, that the restriction denoted by the equation f(A1, . . . An) = 1,
forms one of the data, and is supposed to be furnished by or to be accordant
with the very experience from which the knowledge of the numerical elements
of the problem is derived.
Representing the events A1, . . . An by x1, . . . xn respectively, and the event
E by z, we have—
Prob. xr = cr, Prob. xrz = crpr. (1)
Let us assume, generally,
xrz = tr,
then combining the system of equations thus indicated with the equations
x¯1 . . . x¯n = 0, f(x1, . . . xn) = 1, or f = 1,
furnished in the data, we ultimately find, as the developed expression of z,
z =
P(XT) + 0t¯1t¯2 . . .t¯n
P(X), (2)
where X represents in succession each constituent found in f, and T a similar series
of constituents of the symbols t1, . . . tn;
P(XT) including only symmetrical
constituents with reference to the two sets of symbols.
The method of reduction to be employed in the present case is so similar to
the one already exemplified in former problems, that I shall merely exhibit the
results to which it leads. We find
Prob. z =
M
M + N
(3)
with the relations
M1
c1p1
. . . =
Mn
cnpn
=
N1
c1(1 - p1)
=
Nn
cn(1 - pn)
= M + N. (4)
Wherein M is formed by suppressing in f(x2, . . . xn) all the factors ¯x1, . . . x¯n,
and changing in the result x1 into m1, xn into mn, while N is formed by
substituting in M, n1 for m1, &c.; moreover M1 consists of that portion of M
of which m1 is a factor, N1 of that portion of N of which n1 is a factor; and so
on.
Let us take, in illustration, the particular case in which the causes A1 . . . An
are mutually exclusive. Here we have
f(x1, . . . xn) = x1x¯2 . . . x¯n . . . + xnx¯1 . . . x¯n-1.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 277
Whence
M = m1 + m2 . . . + mn,
N = n1 + n2 . . . + nn,
M1 = m1, N1 = n1, &c.
Substituting, we have
m1
c1p1
. . . =
mn
cnpn
=
n1
c1(1 - p1)
. . . =
nn
cn(1 - pn)
= M + N.
Hence we find
m1 + m2 . . . + mn
c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn
= M + N,
or
M
c1p1 . . . + cnpn
= M + N.
Hence, by (3),
Prob. z = c1p1 . . . + cnpn,
a known result.
There are other particular cases in which the system (4) admits of ready
solution. It is, however, obvious that in most instances it would lead to results
of great complexity. Nor does it seem probable that the existence of a functional
relation among causes, such as is assumed in the data of the general problem,
will often be presented in actual experience; if we except only the particular
cases above discussed.
Had the general problem been modified by the restriction that the event E
cannot occur, all the causes A1 . . . An being absent, instead of the restriction
that the said causes cannot all fail, the remaining condition denoted by the
equation f(A1, . . . An) = 1 being retained, we should have found for the final
logical equation
z =
X
1
(XT) + 0X(X),
P(X) being, as before, equal to f(x1, . . . xn), but P
1
(XT) formed by rejecting
from f the particular constituent ¯x1 . . . x¯n if therein contained, and then multiplying
each x-constituent of the result by the corresponding t-constituent. It is
obvious that in the particular case in which the causes are mutually exclusive
the value of Prob. z hence deduced will be the same as before.
18. Problem IX.—Assuming the data of any of the previous problems, let
it be required to determine the probability that if the event E present itself, it
will be associated with the particular cause Ar; in other words, to determine the
`a posteriori probability of the cause Ar when the event E has been observed to
occur.
In this case we must seek the value of the fraction
Prob. xrz
Prob. z
, or
crpr
Prob. z
, by the data. (1)
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 278
As in the previous problems, the value of Prob. z has been assigned upon different
hypotheses relative to the connexion or want of connexion of the causes,
it is evident that in all those cases the present problem is susceptible of a determinate
solution by simply substituting in (1) the value of that element thus
determined.
If the `a priori probabilities of the causes are equal, we have c1 = c2 . . . = cr.
Hence for the different causes the value (1) will vary directly as the quantity
pr. Wherefore whatever the nature of the connexion among the causes, the `a
posteriori probability of each cause will be proportional to the probability of
the observed event E when that cause is known to exist. The particular case
of this theorem, which presents itself when the causes are mutually exclusive, is
well known. We have then
Prob. xrz
Prob. z
= P
crpr
crpr
=
pr
p1 + p2 . . . + pn
,
the values of c1, . . . cn being equal.
Although, for the demonstration of these and similar theorems in the particular
case in which the causes are mutually exclusive, it is not necessary to
introduce the functional symbol f, which is, indeed, to claim for ourselves the
choice of all possible and conceivable hypotheses of the connexion of the causes,
yet, under every form, the solution by the method of this work of problems,
in which the number of the data is indefinitely great, must always partake of
a somewhat complex character. Whether the systematic evolution which it
presents, first, of the logical, secondly, of the numerical relations of a problem,
furnishes any compensation for the length and occasional tediousness of its processes,
I do not presume to inquire. Its chief value undoubtedly consists in its
power,—in the mastery which it gives us over questions which would apparently
baffle the unassisted strength of human reason. For this cause it has not been
deemed superfluous to exhibit in this chapter its application to problems, some
of which may possibly be regarded as repulsive, from their difficulty, without
being recommended by any prospect of immediate utility. Of the ulterior value
of such speculations it is, I conceive, impossible for us, at present, to form any
decided judgment.
19. The following problem is of a much easier description than the previous
ones.
Problem X.—The probability of the occurrence of a certain natural phænomenon
under given circumstances is p. Observation has also recorded a probability a of
the existence of a permanent cause of that phænomenon, i.e. of a cause which
would always produce the event under the circumstances supposed. What is the
probability that if the phænomenon is observed to occur n times in succession
under the given circumstances, it will occur the n + 1th time? What also is
the probability, after such observation, of the existence of the permanent cause
referred to?
First Case.—Let t represent the existence of a permanent cause, and
x1, x2 . . . xn+1 the successive occurrences of the natural phænomenon.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 279
If the permanent cause exist, the events x1, x2 . . . xn+1 are necessary consequences.
Hence
t = vx1, t = vx2, &c.,
and eliminating the indefinite symbols,
t(1 - x1) = 0, t(1 - x2) = 0, t(1 - xn+1) = 0.
Now we are to seek the probability that if the combination x1x2 . . . xn happen,
the event xn+1 will happen, i.e. we are to seek the value of the fraction
Prob. x1x2 . . . xn+1
Prob. x1x2 . . . xn
.
We will first seek the value of Prob. x1x2 . . . xn. Represent the combination
x1 x2 . . . xn by w, then we have the following logical equations:
t(1 - x1) = 0, t(1 - x2) = 0, . . . t(1 - xn) = 0,
x1 x2 . . . xn = w.
Reducing the last to the form
(x1 x2 . . . xn)(1 - w) + w(1 - x1 x2 . . . xn) = 0,
and adding it to the former ones, we have
Xt(1 - xi) + x1 x2 . . . xn(1 - w) + w(1 - x1 x2 . . . xn) = 0, (1)
wherein P extends to all values of i from 1 to n, for the one logical equation of
the data. With this we must connect the numerical conditions,
Prob. x1 = Prob. x2 . . . = Prob. xn = p, Prob. t = a;
and our object is to find Prob, w.
From (1) we have
w =
Pt(1 - xi) + x1 x2 . . . xn
2x1 x2 . . . xn - 1
=
P(1 - xi) + x1 x2 . . . xn
2x1 x2 . . . xn - 1
t +
x1 x2 . . . xn
2x1 x2 . . . xn - 1
(1 - t), (2)
on developing with respect to t. This result must further be developed with
respect to x1, x2, . . . xn.
Now if we make x1 = 1, x2 = 1, . . . xn = 1, the coefficients both of t and of
1 - t become 1. If we give to the same symbols any other set of values formed
by the interchange of 0 and 1, it is evident that the coefficient of t will become
negative, while that of 1 - t will become 0. Hence the full development (2) will
be

as the expression of the probability that if the phænomenon be n times repeated,
it will also present itself the n + 1th time. By the method of Chapter XIX. it is
found that a cannot exceed p in value.
The following verifications are obvious:—
1st. If a = 0, the expression reduces to p, as it ought to do. For when
it is certain that no permanent cause exists, the successive occurrences of the
phænomenon are independent.
2nd. If p = 1, the expression becomes 1, as it ought to do.
3rd. If p = a, the expression becomes 1, unless a = 0. If the probability
of a phænomenon is equal to the probability that there exists a cause which
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 281
under given circumstances would always produce it, then the fact that that
phænomenon has ever been noticed under those circumstances, renders certain
its re-appearance under the same.5
4th. As n increases, the expression approaches in value to unity. This
indicates that the probability of the recurrence of the event increases with the
frequency of its successive appearances,—a result agreeable to the natural laws
of expectation.
Second Case.—We are now to seek the probability `a posteriori of the
existence of a permanent cause of the phænomenon. This requires that we
ascertain the value of the fraction
Prob. tx1x2 . . . xn
Prob. x1x2 . . . xn
the denominator of which has already been determined.
To determine the numerator assume
tx1x2 . . . xn = w,
then proceeding as before, we obtain for the logical development,
w = tx1x2 . . . xn + 0(1 - t).
Whence, passing from Logic to Algebra, we have at once
Prob. w = a,
a result which might have been anticipated. Substituting then for the numerator
and denominator of the above fraction their values, we have for the `a posteriori
probability of a permanent cause, the expression
a
a + (p - a)

p - a
1 - a

.
It is obvious that the value of this expression increases with the value of n.
I am indebted to a learned correspondent,6 whose original contributions
to the theory of probabilities have already been referred to, for the following
verification of the first of the above results (3).
5As we can neither re-enter nor recall the state of infancy, we are unable to say how far
such results as the above serve to explain the confidence with which young children connect
events whose association they have once perceived. But we may conjecture, generally, that
the strength of their expectations is due to the necessity of inferring (as a part of their rational
nature), and the narrow but impressive experience upon which the faculty is exercised. Hence
the reference of every kind of sequence to that of cause and effect. A little friend of the
author’s, on being put to bed, was heard to ask his brother the pertinent question,—”Why
does going to sleep at night make it light in the morning?” The brother, who was a year older,
was able to reply, that it would be light in the morning even if little boys did not go to sleep
at night.

“The whole `a priori probability of the event (under the circumstances) being
p, and the probability of some cause C which would necessarily produce it, a,
let x be the probability that it will happen if no such cause as C exist. Then
we have the equation
p = a + (1 - a)x,
whence
x =
p - a
1 - a
.
Now the phænomenon observed is the occurrence of the event n times. The `a
priori probability of this would be—
1 supposing C to exist,
x
n
supposing C not to exist;
whence the `a posteriori probability that C exists is
a
a + (1 - a)x
n
,
that C does not exist is
(1 - a)x
n
a + (1 - a)x

Consequently the probability of another occurrence is

n
a + (1 - a)x
n
× a,
or
a + (1 - a)x
n+1
a + (1 - a)x
n
,
which, on replacing n by its value p - a
1 - a
, will be found to agree with (3).”
Similar verifications might, it is probable, also be found for the following
results, obtained by the direct application of the general method.
The probability, under the same circumstances, that if, out of n occasions,
the event happen r times, and fail n - r times, it will happen on the n + 1th
time is

The probability of a permanent cause (r being less than n) is 0. This is
easily verified.

If p be the probability of an event, and c the probability that if it occur it

20. It is remarkable that the solutions of the previous problems are void of
any arbitrary element. We should scarcely, from the appearance of the data,
have anticipated such a circumstance. It is, however, to be observed, that
in all those problems the probabilities of the causes involved are supposed to
be known `a priori. In the absence of this assumed element of knowledge, it
seems probable that arbitrary constants would necessarily appear in the final
solution. Some confirmation of this remark is afforded by a class of problems to
which considerable attention has been directed, and which, in conclusion, I shall
briefly consider. It has been observed that there exists in the heavens a large
number of double stars of extreme closeness. Either these apparent instances
of connexion have some physical ground or they have not. If they have not,
we may regard the phenomenon of a double star as the accidental result of
a “random distribution” of stars over the celestial vault, i.e. of a distribution
which would render it just as probable that either member of the binary system
should appear in one spot as in another. If this hypothesis be assumed, and if
the number of stars of a requisite brightness be known, we can determine what
is the probability that two of them should be found within such limits of mutual
distance as to constitute the observed phenomenon. Thus Mitchell,7
estimating
that there are 230 stars in the heavens equal in brightness to ß Capricorni,
determines that it is 80 to 1 against such a combination being presented were
those stars distributed at random. The probability, when such a combination
has been observed, that there exists between its members a physical ground of
connexion, is then required.
Again, the sum of the inclinations of the orbits of the ten known planets
to the plane of the ecliptic in the year 1801 was 91?
·4187, according to the
French measures. Were all inclinations equally probable, Laplace8 determines,
that there would be only the excessively small probability .00000011235 that
the mean of the inclinations should fall within the limit thus assigned. And he
hence concludes, that there is a very high probability in favour of a disposing
cause, by which the inclinations of the planetary orbits have been confined
within such narrow bounds. Professor De Morgan,9
taking the sum of the
inclinations at 92?
, gives to the above probability the value .00000012, and infers
that “it is 1: .00000012, that there was a necessary cause in the formation of the
solar system for the inclinations being what they are.” An equally determinate

CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 284
conclusion has been drawn from observed coincidences between the direction
of circular polarization in rock-crystal, and that of certain oblique faces in its
crystalline structure.10
These problems are all of a similar character. A certain hypothesis is
framed, of the various possible consequences of which we are able to assign
the probabilities with perfect rigour. Now some actual result of observation
being found among those consequences, and its hypothetical probability being
therefore known, it is required thence to determine the probability of the hypothesis
assumed, or its contrary. In Mitchell’s problem, the hypothesis is that
of a “random distribution of the stars,”—the possible and observed consequence,
the appearance of a close double star. The very small probability of such a result
is held to imply that the probability of the hypothesis is equally small, or,
at least, of the same order of smallness. And hence the high and, and as some
think, determinate probability of a disposing cause in the stellar arrangements
is inferred. Similar remarks apply to the other examples adduced.
21. The general problem, in whatsoever form it may be presented, admits
only of an indefinite solution. Let x represent the proposed hypothesis, y a
phænomenon which might occur as one of its possible consequences, and whose
calculated probability, on the assumption of the truth of the hypothesis, is p,
and let it be required to determine the probability that if the phænomenon y
is observed, the hypothesis x is true. The very data of this problem cannot be
expressed without the introduction of an arbitrary element. We can only write
Prob. x = a, Prob. xy = ap; (1)
a being perfectly arbitrary, except that it must fall within the limits 0 and 1
inclusive. If then P represent the conditional probability sought, we have
P =
Prob. xy
Prob. y
=
ap
Prob. y
. (2)
It remains then to determine Prob. y. Let xy = t, then
y =
t
x
= tx +
1
0
t(1 - x) + 0(1 - t)x +
0
0
(1 - t)(1 - x). (3)
Hence observing that Prob. x = a, Prob. t = ap, and passing from Logic to
Algebra, we have
Prob. y =
tx + c(1 - t)x
tx + 1 - t
,
with the relations
tx + (1 - t)x
a
=
tx
ap
= tx + 1 - t.
Hence we readily find
Prob. y = ap + c(1 - a). (4)
10Edinburgh Review, No. 185, p. 32. This article, though not entirely free from error, is
well worthy of attention.
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 285
Now recurring to (3), we find that c is the probability, that if the event
(1 - t)(1 - x) occur, the event y will occur. But
(1 - t)(1 - x) = (1 - xy)(1 - x) = 1 - x.
Hence c is the probability that if the event x do not occur, the event y will
occur.
Substituting the value of Prob. y in (2), we have the following theorem:
The calculated probability of any phænomenon y, upon an assumed physical
hypothesis x, being p, the `a posteriori probability P of the physical hypothesis,
when the phænomenon has been observed, is expressed by the equation
P =
ap
ap + c(1 - a)
, (5)
where a and c are arbitrary constants, the former representing the `a priori probability
of the hypothesis, the latter the probability that if the hypothesis were false,
the event y would present itself.
The principal conclusion deducible from the above theorem is that, other
things being the same, the value of P increases and diminishes simultaneously
with that of p. Hence the greater or less the probability of the phænomenon
when the hypothesis is assumed, the greater or less is the probability of the hypothesis
when the phænomenon has been observed. When p is very small, then
generally P also is small, unless either a is large or c small. Hence, secondly,
if the probability of the phænomenon is very small when the hypothesis is assumed,
the probability of the hypothesis is very small when the phænomenon
is observed, unless either the `a priori probability a of the hypothesis is large,
or the probability of the phænomenon upon any other hypothesis small.
The formula (5) admits of exact verification in various cases, as when c = 0,
or a = 1, or a = 0. But it is evident that it does not, unless there be means
for determining the values of a and c, yield a definite value of P. Any solutions
which profess to accomplish this object, either are erroneous in principle,
or involve a tacit assumption respecting the above arbitrary elements. Mr.
De Morgan’s solution of Laplace’s problem concerning the existence of a determining
cause of the narrow limits within which the inclinations of the planetary
orbits to the plane of the ecliptic are confined, appears to me to be of the latter
description. Having found a probability p = .00000012, that the sum of
the inclinations would be less than 92? were all degrees of inclination equally
probable in each orbit, this able writer remarks: “If there be a reason for the
inclinations being as described, the probability of the event is 1. Consequently,
it is 1: .00000012 (i.e. 1: p), that there was a necessary cause in the formation
of the solar system for the inclinations being what they are.” Now this result is
what the equation (5) would really give, if, assigning to p the above value, we
should assume c = 1, a =
1
2
. For we should thus find,
P =
1
2
p
1

p +
1
2
=
p
1 + p
? 1 - P : P : : 1: p. (6)
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 286
But P representing the probability, `a posteriori, that all inclinations are
equally probable, 1-P is the probability, `a posteriori, that such is not the case,
or, adopting Mr. De Morgan’s alternative, that a determining cause exists. The
equation (6), therefore, agrees with Mr. De Morgan’s result.
22. Are we, however, justified in assigning to a and c particular values? I am
strongly disposed to think that we are not. The question is of less importance
in the special instance than in its ulterior bearings. In the received applications
of the theory of probabilities, arbitrary constants do not explicitly appear; but
in the above, and in many other instances sanctioned by the highest authorities,
some virtual determination of them has been attempted. And this circumstance
has given to the results of the theory, especially in reference to questions of
causation, a character of definite precision, which, while on the one hand it
has seemed to exalt the dominion and extend the province of numbers, even
beyond the measure of their ancient claim to rule the world;11 on the other
hand has called forth vigorous protests against their intrusion into realms in
which conjecture is the only basis of inference. The very fact of the appearance
of arbitrary constants in the solutions of problems like the above, treated by the
method of this work, seems to imply, that definite solution is impossible, and
to mark the point where inquiry ought to stop. We possess indeed the means
of interpreting those constants, but the experience which is thus indicated is as
much beyond our reach as the experience which would preclude the necessity of
any attempt at solution whatever.
Another difficulty attendant upon these questions, and inherent, perhaps,
in the very constitution of our faculties, is that of precisely defining what is
meant by Order. The manifestations of that principle, except in very complex
instances, we have no difficulty in detecting, nor do we hesitate to impute to it
an almost necessary foundation in causes operating under Law. But to assign
to it a standard of numerical value would be a vain, not to say a presumptuous,
endeavour. Yet must the attempt be made, before we can aspire to weigh with
accuracy the probabilities12 13 of different constitutions of the universe, so as
to determine the elements upon which alone a definite solution of the problems
in question can be established.
23. The most usual mode of endeavouring to evade the necessary arbitrariness
of the solution of problems in the theory of probabilities which rest upon
insufficient data, is to assign to some element whose real probability is unknown
all possible degrees of probability; to suppose that these degrees of probability
are themselves equally probable; and, regarding them as so many distinct causes
of the phenomenon observed, to apply the theorems which represent the case of
an effect due to some one of a number of equally probable but mutually exclusive
causes (Problem 9). For instance, the rising of the sun after a certain interval

of darkness having been observed m times in succession, the probability of its
again rising under the same circumstances is determined, on received principles,
in the following manner. Let p be any unknown probability between 0 and 1,
and c (infinitesimal and constant) the probability, that the probability of the
sun’s rising after an interval of darkness lies between the limits p and p + dp.
Then the probability that the sun will rise m times in succession is

the known and generally received solution.
The above solution is usually founded upon a supposed analogy of the problem
with that of the drawing of balls from an urn containing a mixture of black
and white balls, between which all possible numerical ratios are assumed to be
equally probable. And it is remarkable, that there are two or three distinct
hypotheses which lead to the same final result. For instance, if the balls are
finite in number, and those which arc drawn are not replaced, or if they are
infinite in number, whether those drawn are replaced or not, then, supposing
that m successive drawings have yielded only white balls, the probability of the
issue of a white ball at the m + 1th drawing is
m + 1
m + 2
.
15
It has been said, that the principle involved in the above and in similar applications
is that of the equal distribution of our knowledge, or rather of our
ignorance—the assigning to different states of things of which we know nothing,
and upon the very ground that we know nothing, equal degrees of probability.
I apprehend, however, that this is an arbitrary method of procedure. Instances
may occur, and one such has been adduced, in which different hypotheses lead
to the same final conclusion. But those instances are exceptional. With reference
to the particular problem in question, it is shown in the memoir cited, that
there is one hypothesis, viz., when the balls are finite in number and not replaced,
which leads to a different conclusion, and it is easy to see that there are
other hypotheses, as strictly involving the principle of the “equal distribution
of knowledge or ignorance,” which would also conduct to conflicting results.

CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 288
24. For instance, let the case of sunrise be represented by the drawing of a
white ball from a bag containing an infinite number of balls, which are all either
black or white, and let the assumed principle be, that all possible constitutions
of the system of balls are equally probable. By a constitution of the system, I
mean an arrangement which assigns to every ball in the system a determinate
colour, either black or white. Let us thence seek the probability, that if m
white balls are drawn in m drawings, a white ball will be drawn in the m + 1th
drawing.
First, suppose the number of the balls to be µ, and let the symbols
x1, x2, . . . xµ be appropriated to them in the following manner. Let xi denote
that event which consists in the i
th ball of the system being white, the
proposition declaratory of such a state of things being xi = 1. In like manner
the compound symbol 1 - xi will represent the circumstance of the i
th ball
being black. It is evident that the several constituents formed of the entire
set of symbols x1, x2, . . . xµ will represent in like manner the several possible
constitutions of the system of balls with respect to blackness and whiteness,
and the number of such constitutions being 2µ, the probability of each will, in
accordance with the hypothesis, be 1
2
µ
. This is the value which we should find
if we substituted in the expression of any constituent for
each of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xµ, the value 1
2
. Hence, then, the probability
of any event which can be expressed as a series of constituents of the above
description, will be found by substituting in such expression the value 1
2
for
each of the above symbols.
Now the larger µ is, the less probable it is that any ball which has been drawn
and replaced will be drawn again. As µ. approaches to infinity, this probability
approaches to 0. And this being the case, the state of the balls actually drawn
can be expressed as a logical function of m of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xµ, and
therefore, by development, as a series of constituents of the said m symbols.
Hence, therefore, its probability will be found by substituting for each of the
symbols, whether in the undeveloped or the developed form, the value 1
2
. But
this is the very substitution which it would be necessary, and which it would
suffice, to make, if the probability of a white ball at each drawing were known,
`a priori, to be 1
2
.
It follows, therefore, that if the number of balls be infinite, and all constitutions
of the system equally probable, the probability of drawing m white balls
in succession will be 1
2m
, and the probability of drawing m + 1 white balls in
succession
1
2m+1 ;
whence the probability that after m white balls have been drawn, the next
drawing will furnish a white one, will be 1
2
. In other words, past experience
does not in this case affect future expectation.
25. It may be satisfactory to verify this result by ordinary methods. To
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 289
accomplish this, we shall seek—
First: The probability of drawing r white balls, and p - r black balls, in p
trials, out of a bag containing µ balls, every ball being replaced after drawing,
and all constitutions of the systems being equally probable, `a priori.
Secondly: The value which this probability assumes when µ becomes infinite.
Thirdly: The probability hence derived, that if m white balls are drawn in
succession, the m + 1th ball drawn will be white also.
The probability that r white balls and p - r black ones will be drawn in p
trials out of an urn containing µ balls, each ball being replaced after trial, and
all constitutions of the system as above defined being equally probable, is equal
to the sum of the probabilities of the same result upon the separate hypotheses
of there being no white balls, 1 white ball,—lastly µ white balls in the urn.
Therefore, it is the sum of the probabilities of this result on the hypothesis of
there being n white balls, n varying from 0 to µ.
Now supposing that there are n white balls, the probability of drawing a
white ball in a single drawing is n
µ
, and the probability of drawing r white balls
and p - r black ones in a particular order in p drawings, is

But there being as many such orders as there are combinations of r things in p

system of µ balls of which n are white, is

and the number of possible constitutions of the system is 2µ. Hence the probability

26. These results only illustrate the fact, that when the defect of data is
supplied by hypothesis, the solutions will, in general, vary with the nature of
the hypotheses assumed; so that the question still remains, only more definite
in form, whether the principles of the theory of probabilities serve to guide
us in the election of such hypotheses. I have already expressed my conviction
that they do not—a conviction strengthened by other reasons than those above
stated. Thus, a definite solution of a problem having been found by the method
of this work, an equally definite solution is sometimes attainable by the same
method when one of the data, suppose Prob. x = p1 is omitted. But I have not
been able to discover any mode of deducing the second solution from the first
by integration, with respect to p supposed variable within limits determined by
Chap. xix. This deduction would, however, I conceive, be possible, were the
principle adverted to in Art. 23 valid. Still it is with diffidence that I express
my dissent on these points from mathematicians generally, and more especiall
CHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 292
from one who, of English writers, has most fully entered into the spirit and the
methods of Laplace; and I venture to hope, that a question, second to none other
in the Theory of Probabilities in importance, will receive the careful attention
which it deserves.
Chapter XXI
PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF THE PREVIOUS
GENERAL METHOD TO THE QUESTION OF THE
PROBABILITY OF JUDGMENTS.
1. On the presumption that the general method of this treatise for the solution
of questions in the theory of probabilities, has been sufficiently elucidated in
the previous chapters, it is proposed here to enter upon one of its practical
applications selected out of the wide field of social statistics, viz., the estimation
of the probability of judgments. Perhaps this application, if weighed by its
immediate results, is not the best that could have been chosen. One of the first
conclusions to which it leads is that of the necessary insufficiency of any data
that experience alone can furnish, for the accomplishment of the most important
object of the inquiry. But in setting clearly before us the necessity of hypotheses
as supplementary to the data of experience, and in enabling us to deduce with
rigour the consequences of any hypothesis which may be assumed, the method
accomplishes all that properly lies within its scope. And it may be remarked,
that in questions which relate to the conduct of our own species, hypotheses are
more justifiable than in questions such as those referred to in the concluding
sections of the previous chapter. Our general experience of human nature comes
in aid of the scantiness and imperfection of statistical records.
2. The elements involved in problems relating to criminal assize are the
following:—
1st. The probability that a particular member of the jury will form a correct
opinion upon the case.
2nd. The probability that the accused party is guilty.
3rd. The probability that he will be condemned, or that he will be acquitted.
4th. The probability that his condemnation or acquittal will be just.
5th. The constitution of the jury.
6th. The data furnished by experience, such as the relative numbers of cases
in which unanimous decisions have been arrived at, or particular majorities
obtained; the number of cases in which decisions have been reversed by superior
courts, &c.
Again, the class of questions under consideration may be regarded as either
direct or inverse. The direct questions of probability are those in which the
293
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 294
probability of correct decision for each member of the tribunal, or of guilt for the
accused party, are supposed to be known `a priori, and in which the probability
of a decision of a particular kind, or with a definite majority, is sought. Inverse
problems are those in which, from the data furnished by experience, it is required
to determine some element which, though it stand to those data in the relation of
cause to effect, cannot directly be made the subject of observation; as when from
the records of the decisions of courts it is required to determine the probability
that a member of a court will judge correctly. To this species of problems, the
most difficult and the most important of the whole series, attention will chiefly
be directed here.
3. There is no difficulty in solving the direct problems referred to in the
above enumeration. Suppose there is but one juryman. Let k be the probability
that the accused person is guilty; x the probability that the juryman will form a
correct opinion; X the probability that the accused person will be condemned:
then—
kx = probability that the accused party is guilty, and that the
juryman judges him to be guilty.
(l - k)(l - x) = probability that the accused person is innocent,
and that the juryman pronounces him guilty.
Now these being the only cases in which a verdict of condemnation can be
given, and being moreover mutually exclusive, we have
X = kx + (1 - k)(1 - x). (1)
In like manner, if there be n jurymen whose separate probabilities of correct
judgment are x1, x2, . . . xn, the probability of an unanimous verdict of condemnation
will be
X = kx1x2 . . . xn + (1 - k)(1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn).
Whence, if the several probabilities x1, x2 . . . xn are equal, and are each represented
by x, we have
X = kxn + (1 - k)(1 - x)
n
. (2)
The probability in the latter case, that the accused person is guilty, will be
kxn
kxn + (1 - k)(1 - x)
n
All these results assume, that the events whose probabilities are denoted by k,
x1, x2, &c., are independent, an assumption which, however, so far as we are
concerned, is involved in the fact that those events are the only ones of which
the probabilities are given.
The probability of condemnation by a given number of voices may be found
on the same principles. If a jury is composed of three persons, whose several
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 295
probabilities of correct decision are x, x
0
, x
00, the probability X2 that the accused
person will be declared guilty by two of them will be
X2 = k{xx0
(1 - x
00) + xx00(1 - x
0
) + x
0x
00(1 - x)}
+(1 - k){(1 - x)(1 - x
0
)x
00 + (1 - x)(1 - x
00)x
0 + (1 - x
0
)(1 - x
00)x},
which if x = x
0 = x
00 reduces to
3kx2
(1 - x) + 3(1 - k)x(1 - x)
2
.
And by the same mode of reasoning, it will appear that if Xi represent the
probability that the accused person will be declared guilty by i voices out of a
jury consisting of n persons, whose separate probabilities of correct judgment
are equal, and represented by x, then
Xi =
n(n - 1). . .(n - i + 1)
1  2 . . . i
{kxi
(1 - x)
n-i + (1 - k)x
n-i
(1 - x)
i
}. (3)
If the probability of condemnation by a determinate majority a is required, we
have simply
i - a = n - i,
whence
i =
n + a
2
,
which must be substituted in the above formula. Of course a admits only of
such values as make i an integer. If n is even, those values are 0, 2, 4, &c.; if
odd, 1, 3, 5, &c., as is otherwise obvious.
The probability of a condemnation by a majority of at least a given number
of voices m, will be found by adding together the following several probabilities
determined as above, viz.:
1st. The probability of a condemnation by an exact majority
m;
2nd. The probability of condemnation by the next greater majority
m + 2;
and so on; the last element of the series being the probability of unanimous
condemnation. Thus the probability of condemnation by a majority of 4 at
least out of 12 jurors, would be
X8 + X9 . . . + X12,
the values of the above terms being given by (3) after making therein n = 12.
4. When, instead of a jury, we are considering the case of a simple deliberative
assembly consisting of n persons, whose separate probabilities of correct
judgment are denoted by x, the above formulæ are replaced by others, made
somewhat more simple by the omission of the quantity k.
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 296
The probability of unanimous decision is
X = x
n + (1 - x)
n
.
The probability of an agreement of i voices out of the whole number is
Xi =
n(n - 1). . .(n - i + 1)
1 · 2 . . . i
{x
i
(1 - x)
n-i + x
n-i
(1 - x)
i
}. (4)
Of this class of investigations it is unnecessary to give any further account.
They have been pursued to a considerable extent by Condorcet, Laplace, Poisson,
and other writers, who have investigated in particular the modes of calculation
and reduction which are necessary to be employed when n and i are
large numbers. It is apparent that the whole inquiry is of a very speculative
character. The values of x and k cannot be determined by direct observation.
We can only presume that they must both in general exceed the value 1
2
; that
the former, x, must increase with the progress of public intelligence; while the
latter, k, must depend much upon those preliminary steps in the administration
of the law by which persons suspected of crime are brought before the tribunal
of their country. It has been remarked by Poisson, that in periods of revolution,
as during the Reign of Terror in France, the value of k may fall, if account be
taken of political offences, far below the limit 1
2
. The history of Europe in days
nearer to our own would probably confirm this observation, and would show
that it is not from the wild license of democracy alone, that the accusation of
innocence is to be apprehended.
Laplace makes the assumption, that all values of x from
x =
1
2
; to x = 1,
are equally probable. He thus excludes the supposition that a juryman is more
likely to be deceived than not, but assumes that within the limits to which the
probabilities of individual correctness of judgment are confined, we have no reason
to give preference to one value of x over another. This hypothesis is entirely
arbitrary, and it would be unavailing here to examine into its consequences.
Poisson seems first to have endeavoured to deduce the values of x and k,
inferentially, from experience. In the six years from 1825 to 1830 inclusively,
the number of individuals accused of crimes against the person before the tribunals
of France was 11016, and the number of persons condemned was 5286.
The juries consisted each of 12 persons, and the decision was pronounced by a
simple majority. Assuming the above numbers to be sufficiently large for the
estimation of probabilities, there would therefore be a probability measured by
the fraction 5286
11016
or .4782 that an accused person would be condemned by a
simple majority. We should have the equation
X7 + X8 . . . + X12 = .4782, (5)
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 297
the general expression for Xi being given by (3) after making therein n = 12.
In the year 1831 the law, having received alteration, required a majority of at
least four persons for condemnation, and the number of persons tried for crimes
against the person during that year being 2046, and the number condemned 743,
the probability of the condemnation of an individual by the above majority was
743
2046 , or .3631. Hence we should have
X8 + X9 . . . + X12 = .3631 . (6)
Assuming that the values of k and x were the same for the year 1831 as for
the previous six years, the two equations (5) and (6) enable us to determine
approximately their values. Poisson thus found,
k = .5354, x = .6786 .
For crimes against property during the same periods, he found by a similar
analysis,
k = .6744, x = .7771 .
The solution of the system (5) (6) conducts in each case to two values of
k, and to two values of x, the one value in each pair being greater, and the
other less, than 1
2
. It was assumed, that in each case the larger value should
be preferred, it being conceived more probable that a party accused should be
guilty than innocent, and more probable that a juryman should form a correct
than an erroneous opinion upon the evidence.
5. The data employed by Poisson, especially those which were furnished
by the year 1831, are evidently too imperfect to permit us to attach much
confidence to the above determinations of x and k; and it is chiefly for the sake
of the method that they are here introduced. It would have been possible to
record during the six years, 1825-30, or during any similar period, the number
of condemnations pronounced with each possible majority of voices. The values
of the several elements X8, X9, . . . X12 were there no reasons of policy to forbid,
might have been accurately ascertained. Here then the conception of the general
problem, of which Poisson’s is a particular case, arises. How shall we, from this
apparently supernumerary system of data, determine the values of x and k?
If the hypothesis, adopted by Poisson and all other writers on the subject, of
the absolute independence of the events whose probabilities are denoted by x
and k be retained, we should be led to form a system of five equations of the
type (3), and either select from these that particular pair of equations which
might appear to be most advantageous, or combine together the equations of the
system by the method of least squares. There might exist a doubt as to whether
the latter method would be strictly applicable in such cases, especially if the
values of x and k afforded by different selected pairs of the given equations were
very different from each other. M. Cournot has considered a somewhat similar
problem, in which, from the records of individual votes in a court consisting of
four judges, it is proposed to investigate the separate probabilities of a correct
verdict from each judge. For the determination of the elements x, x
0
, x
00
, x
000, he
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 298
obtains eight equations, which he divides into two sets of four equations, and he
remarks, that should any considerable discrepancy exist between the values of
x, x
0
, x
00
, x
000, determined from those sets, it might be regarded as an indication
that the hypothesis of the independence of the opinions of the judges was, in
the particular case, untenable. The principle of this mode of investigation has
been adverted to in (XVIII. 4).
6. I proceed to apply to the class of problems above indicated, the method of
this treatise, and shall inquire, first, whether the records of courts and deliberative
assemblies, alone, can furnish any information respecting the probabilities
of correct judgment for their individual members, and, it appearing that they
cannot, secondly, what kind and amount of necessary hypothesis will best comport
with the actual data.
Proposition I.
From the mere records of the decisions of a court or deliberative assembly,
it is not possible to deduce any definite conclusion respecting the correctness of
the individual judgments of its members.
Though this Proposition may appear to express but the conviction of unassisted
good sense, it will not be without interest to show that it admits of rigorous
demonstration. Let us suppose the case of a deliberative assembly consisting
of n members, no hypothesis whatever being made respecting the dependence
or independence of their judgments. Let the logical symbols x1, x2, . . . xn be
employed according to the following definition, viz.: Let the generic symbol xi
denote that event which consists in the uttering of a correct opinion by the
i
th member, Ai of the court. We shall consider the values of Prob. x1, Prob.
x2, . . .Prob. xn, as the quæsita of a problem, the expression of whose possible
data we must in the next place investigate.
Now those data are the probabilities of events capable of being expressed
by definite logical functions of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn. Let X1, X2, . . . Xm
represent the functions in question, and let the actual system of data be
Prob. X1 = a1, Prob. X2 = a2, Prob. Xm = am.
Then from the very nature of the case it may be shown that X1, X2, . . . Xm,
are functions which remain unchanged if x1, x2, . . . xn are therein changed into
1 - x1, 1 - x2, . . . 1 - xn respectively. Thus, if it were recorded that in a certain
proportion of instances the votes given were unanimous, the event whose probability,
supposing the instances sufficiently numerous, is thence determined, is
expressed by the logical function
x1x2 . . . xn + (1 - x1)(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn),
a function which satisfies the above condition. Again, let it be recorded, that in
a certain proportion of instances, the vote of an individual, suppose A1, differs
from that of all the other members of the court. The event, whose probability
is thus given, will be expressed by the function
x1(1 - x2). . .(1 - xn) + (1 - x1)x2 . . . xn;
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 299
also satisfying the above conditions. Thus, as agreement in opinion may be an
agreement in either truth or error; and as, when opinions are divided, either
party may be right or wrong; it is manifest that the expression of any particular
state, whether of agreement or difference of sentiment in the assembly, will
depend upon a logical function of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn, which similarly
involves the privative symbols 1 - x1, 1 - x2, . . . 1 - xn. But in the records of
assemblies, it is not presumed to declare which set of opinions is right or wrong.
Hence the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm must be solely of the kind above described.
7. Now in proceeding, according to the general method, to determine the
value of Prob. x1, we should first equate the functions X1, . . . Xm to a new set
of symbols t1, . . . tm. From the equations
X1 = t1, X2 = t2, . . . Xm = tm,
thus formed, we should eliminate the symbols x2, x3, . . . xn, and then determine
x1 as a developed logical function of the symbols t1, t2, . . . tm, expressive of
events whose probabilities are given. Let the result of the above elimination be
Ex1 + E
0
(1 - x1) = 0; (1)
E and E0 being function of t1, t2, . . . tm. Then
x1 =
E0
E0 - E
. (2)
Now the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm are symmetrical with reference to the symbols
x1, . . . xn and 1-x1, . . . 1-xn. It is evident, therefore, that in the equation
E0 must be identical with E. Hence (2) gives
x =
E
0
,
and it is evident, that the only coefficients which can appear in the development
of the second member of the above equation are 0
0
and 1
0
. The former will present
itself whenever the values assigned to t1, . . . tm in determining the coefficient of
a constituent, are such as to make E = 0, the latter, or an equivalent result, in
every other case. Hence we may represent the development under the form
x1 =
0
0
C +
1
0
D (3)
C and D being constituents, or aggregates of constituents, of the symbols
t1, t2, . . . tm. Passing then from Logic to Algebra, we have
Prob. x1 =
cC
C
= c,
the function V of the general Rule (XVII. 17) reducing in the present case to C.
The value of Prob. x1 is therefore wholly arbitrary, if we except the condition
that it must not transcend the limits 0 and 1. The individual values of Prob.
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 300
x2, . . .Prob. xn, are in like manner arbitrary. It does not hence follow, that
these arbitrary values are not connected with each other by necessary conditions
dependent upon the data. The investigation of such conditions would, however,
properly fall under the methods of Chap. xix.
If, reverting to the final logical equation, we seek the interpretation of c, we
obtain but a restatement of the original problem. For since C and D together
include all possible constituents of t1, t2, . . . tm, we have
C + D = 1;
and since D is affected by the coefficient 1
0
, it is evident that on substituting
therein for t1, t2, . . . tm, their expressions in terms of x1, x2, . . . xn, we should
have D = 0. Hence the same substitution would give C = 1. Now by the
rule, c is the probability that if the event denoted by C take place, the event
x1 will take place. Hence C being equal to 1, and, therefore, embracing all
possible contingencies, c must be interpreted as the absolute probability of the
occurrence of the event x1.
It may be interesting to determine in a particular case the actual form of
the final logical equation. Suppose, then, that the elements from which the
data are derived are the records of events distinct and mutually exclusive. For
instance, let the numerical data a1, a2, . . . am, be the respective probabilities of
distinct and definite majorities. Then the logical functions X1, X2, . . . Xm being
mutually exclusive, must satisfy the conditions
X1X2 = 0, . . . X1Xm = 0, X2Xm = 0, &c.
Whence we have,
t1t2 = 0, t1tm = 0, &c.
Under these circumstances it may easily be shown, that the developed logical
value of x1 will be
x1 =
0
0
(t¯1t¯2 . . .t¯m + t1t¯2 . . .t¯m . . . + tmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1)
+ constitutents whose coefficients are 1
0
.
In the above equation t¯1 stands for 1 - t1, &c.
These investigations are equally applicable to the case in which the probabilities
of the verdicts of a jury, so far as agreement and disagreement of opinion
are concerned, form the data of a problem. Let the logical symbol w denote
that event or state of things which consists in the guilt of the accused person.
Then the functions X1, X2 . . . Xm of the present problem are such, that no
change would therein ensue from simultaneously converting w, x1, x2 . . . xn into
w, ¯ x¯1, x¯2, . . . x¯n respectively. Hence the final logical value of w, as well as those
of x1, x2, . . . xn will be exhibited under the same form (3), and a like general
conclusion thence deduced.
It is therefore established, that from mere statistical documents nothing can
be inferred respecting either the individual correctness of opinion of a judge or
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 301
counsellor, the guilt of an individual, or the merits of a disputed question. If the
determination of such elements as the above can be reduced within the province
of science at all, it must be by virtue either of some assumed criterion of truth
furnishing us with new data, or of some hypothesis relative to the connexion or
the independence of individual judgments, which may warrant a new form of
the investigation. In the examination of the results of different hypotheses, the
following general Proposition will be of importance.
Proposition II.
8. Given the probabilities of the n simple events x1, x2, . . . xn, viz.:—
Prob. x1 = c1, Prob. x2 = c2, . . .Prob. xn = cn; (1)
also the probabilities of the m - 1 compound events X1, X2, . . . Xm-1, viz.:—
Prob. X1 = a1, Prob. X2 = a2, . . .Prob. Xm-1 = am-1; (2)
the latter events X1 . . . Xm-1 being distinct and mutually exclusive; required the
probability of any other compound event X.
In this proposition it is supposed, that X1, X2, . . . Xm-1, as well as
X, are functions of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn alone. Moreover, the events
X1, X2, . . . Xm-1 being mutually exclusive, we have
X1X2 = 0, . . . X1Xm-1 = 0, X2X3 = 0, &c.; (3)
the product of any two members of the system vanishing. Now assume
X1 = t1, Xm-1 = tm-1, X = t. (4)
Then t must be determined as a logical function of x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tm-1.
Now by (3),
t1t2 = 0, t1tm-1 = 0, t2t3 = 0, &c.; (5)
all binary products of t1, . . .t¯m-1, vanishing. The developed expression for t
can, therefore, only involve in the list of constituents which have 1, 0, or 0
0
for
their coefficients, such as contain some one of the following factors, viz.:—
t¯1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1, t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1, . . .t¯1 . . .t¯m-2tm-1; (6)
t¯1 standing for 1 - t1, &c. It remains to assign that portion of each constituent
which involves the symbols x1 . . . xn; together with the corresponding coeffi-
cients.
Since Xi = ti (i being any integer between 1 and m - 1 inclusive), it is
evident that
Xit¯1 . . .t¯m-1 = 0,
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 302
from the very constitution of the functions. Any constituent included in the
first member of the above equation would, therefore, have 1
0
for its coefficient.
Now let
Xm = 1 - X1 . . . - Xm-1; (7)
and it is evident that such constituents as involve t¯1 . . .t¯m-1, as a factor, and
yet have coefficients of the form 1, 0, or 0
0
, must be included in the expression
Xmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1.
Now Xm may be resolved into two portions, viz., X Xm and (1 - X)Xm, the
former being the sum of those constituents of Xm which are found in X, the
latter of those which are not found in X. It is evident that in the developed
expression of t, which is equivalent to X, the coefficients of the constituents in
the former portion X Xm will be 1, while those of the latter portion (1 - X)Xm
will be 0. Hence the elements we have now considered will contribute to the
development of t the terms
XXmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1 + 0(1 - X)Xmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1.
Again, since X1 = t1, while X2t1 = t2t1 = 0, &c., it is evident that the only
constituents involving t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1, as a factor which have coefficients of the
form 1, 0, or 0
0
, will be included in the expression
X1t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1;
and reasoning as before, we see that this will contribute to the development of
t the terms
XX1t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1 + 0(1 - X)X1t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1.
Proceeding thus with the remaining terms of (6), we deduce for the final
expression of t,
t = XXmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1 + XX1t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1 . . . + XXm-1t¯1 . . .t¯m-2tm-1
+0(1 - X)Xmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1 + 0(1 - X)X1t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1 + &c. (8)
+terms whose coefficients are 1
0
.
In this expression it is to be noted that X Xm denotes the sum of those
constituents which are common to X and Xm, that sum being actually given
by multiply ing X and Xm together, according to the rules of the calculus of
Logic.
In passing from Logic to Algebra, we shall represent by (X Xm) what the
above product becomes, when, after effecting the multiplication, or selecting the
common constituents, we give to the symbols x1, . . . xn, a quantitative meaning.
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 303
With this understanding we shall have, by the general Rule (XVII. 17),
Prob. t
=
(XXm)t¯1 . . .t¯m-1 + (XX1)t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1 + (XXm-1)t¯1 . . .t¯m-2tm-1
V
, (9)
V = Xmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1 + X1t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1 . . . + Xm-1t¯1 . . .t¯m-2tm-1 (10)
whence the relations determining x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tm-1 will be of the following
type (i varying from 1 to n),
(xiXm)t¯1 . . .t¯m-1 + (xiX1)t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1 + (xiXm-1)t¯1 . . .t¯m-2tm-1
ci
=
X1t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1
a1
. . . =
Xm-1t¯1 . . .t¯m-2tm-1
am-1
= V. (11)
From the above system we shall next eliminate the symbols t1, . . . tm-1.
We have
t1t¯2 . . .t¯m-1 =
a1V
X1
, t¯1 . . .t¯m-2tm-1 =
am-1V
Xm-1
. (12)
Substituting these values in (10), we find
V = Xmt¯1 . . .t¯m-1 + a1V . . . + am-1V.
Hence,
t¯1 . . .t¯m-1 =
(1 - a1 . . . - am-1)V
Xm
.
Now let
am = 1 - a1 . . . - am-1, (13)
then we have
t¯1 . . .t¯m-1 =
amV
Xm
. (14)
Now reducing, by means of (12) and (14), the equation (9), and the equation
formed by equating the first line of (11) to the symbol V ; writing also Prob. X
for Prob. t, we have
Prob. X =
a1(XX1)
X1
+
a2(XX2)
X2
. . . +
am(XXm)
Xm
, (15)
a1(xiX1)
X1
+
a2(xiX2)
X2
. . . +
am(xiXm)
Xm
= ci
; (16)
wherein Xm and am are given by (7) and (13). These equations involve the
direct solution of the problem under consideration. In (16) we have the type
of n equations (formed by giving to i the values 1, 2, . . . n successively), from
which the values of x1, x2, . . . xn, will be found, and those values substituted in
(15) give the value of Prob. X as a function of the constants a1, c1, &c.
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 304
One conclusion deserving of notice, which is deducible from the above solution,
is, that if the probabilities of the compound events X1, . . . Xm-1, are the
same as they would be were the events x1, . . . xn entirely independent, and with
given probabilities c1, . . . cn, then the probability of the event X will be the same
as if calculated upon the same hypothesis of the absolute independence of the
events x1, . . . xn. For upon the hypothesis supposed, the assumption x1 = c1,
xn = cn, in the quantitative system would give X1 = a1, Xm = am, whence
(15) and (16) would give
Prob. X = (XX1) + (XX2). . . + (XXm), (17)
(xiX1) + (xiX2). . . + (xiXm) = ci
. (18)
But since X1 + X2 . . . + Xm = 1, it is evident that the second member of
(17) will be formed by taking all the constituents that are contained in X, and
giving them an algebraic significance. And a similar remark applies to (18).
Whence those equations respectively give
Prob. X (logical) = X (algebraic),
xi = ci
.
Wherefore, if X = f(x1, x2, . . . xn), we have
Prob. X = f(c1, c2, . . . cn),
which is the result in question.
Hence too it would follow, that if the quantities c1, . . . cn were indeterminate,
and no hypothesis were made as to the possession of a mean common value, the
system (15) (16) would be satisfied by giving to those quantities any such values,
x1, x2, . . . xn, as would satisfy the equations
X1 = a1 . . . Xm-1 = am-1, X = a,
supposing the value of the element a, like the values of a1, . . . am-1, to be given
by experience. 9. Before applying the general solution (15) (16), to the question
of the probability of judgments, it will be convenient to make the following
transformation. Let the data be
x1 = c1 . . . xn = cn,
Prob. X1 = a1 . . .Prob. Xm-2 = am-2;
and let it be required to determine Prob. Xm-1, the unknown value of which
we will represent by am-1. Then in (15) and (16) we must change
X into Xm-1, Prob. X into am-1,
Xm-1 into Xm-2, am-1 into am-2,
Xm into Xm-1 + Xm, am into am-1 + am;
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 305
with these transformations, and observing that (Xm-1Xr) = 0, except when
r = m - 1, and that it is then equal to Xm-1, the equations (15) (16) give
am-1 =
(am-1 + am)Xm-1
Xm-1 + Xm
, (19)
a1(xiX1)
X1
. . . +
am-2(xiXm-2)
Xm-2
+
(am-1 + am)(xiXm-1 + xiXm
Xm-1 + Xm
. (20)
Now from (19) we find
Xm-1
am-1
=
Xm
am
=
Xm-1 + Xm
am-1 + am
,
by virtue of which the last term of (20) may be reduced to the form
am-1(xiXm-1)
Xm-1
+
am(xiXm)
Xm
.
With these reductions the system (17) and (18) may be replaced by the following
symmetrical one, viz.:
Xm-1
am-1
=
Xm
am
, (21)
a1(xiX1)
X1
+
a2(xiX2)
X2
. . . +
am(xiXm)
Xm
= ci
. (22)
These equations, in connexion with (7) and (13), enable us to determine am-1, as
a function of c1 . . . cn, a1 . . . am-2, the numerical data supposed to be furnished
by experience. We now proceed to their application.
Proposition III.
10. Given any system of probabilities drawn from recorded instances of unanimity,
or of assigned numerical majority in the decisions of a deliberative assembly;
required, upon a certain determinate hypothesis, the mean probability of
correct judgment for a member of the assembly.
In what way the probabilities of unanimous decision and of specific numerical
majorities may be determined from experience, has been intimated in a former
part of this chapter. Adopting the notation of Prop. i. we shall represent
the events whose probabilities are given by the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm-1. It
has appeared from the very nature of the case that these events are mutually
exclusive, and that the functions by which they are represented are symmetrical
with reference to the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn. Those symbols we continue to use in
the same sense as in Prop. i., viz., by xi we understand that event which consists
in the formation of a correct opinion by the i
th member of the assembly.
Now the immediate data of experience are—
Prob. X1 = a1, Prob. X2 = a2 . . .Prob. Xm-2 = am-2, (1)
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 306
Prob. Xm-1 = am-1. (2)
X1 . . . Xm-1 being functions of the logical symbols x1, . . . xn to the probabilities
of the events denoted by which, we shall assign the indeterminate value c. Thus
we shall have
Prob. x1 = Prob. x2 · · · = Prob. xn = c. (3)
Now it has been seen, Prop. i., that the immediate data (1) (2), unassisted
by any hypothesis, merely conduct us to a restatement of the problem. On the
other hand, it is manifest that if, adopting the methods of Laplace and Poisson,
we employ the system (3) alone as the data for the application of the method of
this work, finally comparing the results obtained with the experimental system
(1) (2), we are relying wholly upon a doubtful hypothesis,—the independence
of individual judgments. But though we ought not wholly to rely upon this hypothesis,
we cannot wholly dispense with it, or with some equivalent substitute.
Let us then examine the consequences of a limited independence of the individual
judgments; the conditions of limitation being furnished by the apparently
superfluous data. From the system (1) (3) let us, by the method of this work,
determine Prob. Xm-1, and, comparing the result with (2), determine c. Even
here an arbitrary power of selection is claimed. But it is manifest from Prop.
i. that something of this kind is unavoidable, if we would obtain a definite solution
at all. As to the principle of selection, I apprehend that the equation (2)
reserved for final comparison should be that which, from the magnitude of its
numerical element am-1, is esteemed the most important of the primary series
furnished by experience.
Now, from the mutually exclusive character of the events denoted by the
functions X1, X2, . . . Xm-1, the concluding equations of the previous proposition
become applicable. On account of the symmetry of the same functions, and the
reduction of the system of values denoted by ci
, to a single value c, the equations
represented by (22) become identical, the values of x1, x2, . . . xn become equal,
and may be replaced by a single value x, and we have simply,
Xm-1
am-1
=
Xm
am
, (4)
a1(xX1)
X1
+
a2(xX2)
X2
. . . +
am(xXm)
Xm
= c. (5)
The following is the nature of the solution thus indicated:
The functions X1, . . . Xm-1, and the values a1, . . . am-1, being given in the
data, we have first,
Xm = 1 - X1 . . . - Xm-1,
am = 1 - a1 . . . - am-1.
From each of the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm thus given or determined, we
must select those constituents which contain a particular symbol, as x1 for a
factor. This will determine the functions (xX1), (xX2), &c., and then in all
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 307
the functions we must change x1, x2, . . . xn individually to x. Or we may regard
any algebraic function Xi
in the system (4) (5) as expressing the probability of
the event denoted by the logical function Xi
, on the supposition that the logical
symbols x1, x2, . . . xn denote independent events whose common probability is x.
On the same supposition (xXi) would denote the probability of the concurrence
of any particular event of the series x1, x2, . . . xn with Xi
. The forms of Xi
,
(xXi), &c. being determined, the equation (4) gives the value of x, and this,
substituted in (5), determines the value of the element c required. Of the two
values which its solution will offer, one being greater, and the other less, than
1
2
, the greater one must be chosen, whensoever, upon general considerations, it
is thought more probable that a member of the assembly will judge correctly,
than that he will judge incorrectly.
Here then, upon the assumed principle that the largest of the values am-1
shall be reserved for final comparison in the equation (2), we possess a definite
solution of the problem proposed. And the same form of solution remains applicable
should any other equation of the system, upon any other ground, as that
of superior accuracy, be similarly reserved in the place of (2).
11. Let us examine to what extent the above reservation has influenced the
final solution. It is evident that the equation (5) is quite independent of the
choice in question. So is likewise the second member of (4). Had we reserved the
function X1, instead of Xm-1, the equation for the determination of x would
have been
X1
a1
=
Xm
am
, (6)
but the value of x thence determined would still have to be substituted in the
same final equation (5). We know that were the events x1, x2, . . . xn really
independent, the equations (4), (6), and all others of which they are types,
would prove equivalent, and that the value of x furnished by any one of them
would be the true value of c. This affords a means of verifying (5). For if that
equation be correct, it ought, under the above circumstances, to be satisfied by
the assumption c = x. In other words, the equation
a1(xX1)
X1
+
a2(xX2)
X2
. . . +
am(xXm)
Xm
= x (7)
ought, on solution, to give the same value of x as the equation (4) or (6). Now
this will be the case. For since, by hypothesis,
X1
a1
=
X2
a2
. . . =
Xm
am
,
we have, by a known theorem,
X1
a1
=
X2
a2
. . . =
Xm
am
=
X1 + X2 . . . + Xm
a1 + a2 . . . + am
= 1.
Hence (7) becomes on substituting a1 for X1, &c.
(xX1) + (xX2). . .(xXm) = x
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 308
a mere identity.
Whenever, therefore, the events x1, x2, . . . xn are really independent, the
system (4) (5) is a correct one, and is independent of the arbitrariness of the
first step of the process by which it was obtained. When the said events are not
independent, the final system of equations will possess, leaving in abeyance the
principle of selection above stated, an arbitrary element. But from the persistent
form of the equation (5) it may be inferred that the solution is arbitrary in a less
degree than the solutions to which the hypothesis of the absolute independence
of the individual judgments would conduct us. The discussion of the limits of
the value of c, as dependent upon the limits of the value of x, would determine
such points.
These considerations suggest to us the question whether the equation (7),
which is symmetrical with reference to the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm, free from
any arbitrary elements, and rigorously exact when the events x1, x2, . . . xn are
really independent, might not be accepted as a mean general solution of the
problem. The proper mode of determining this point would, I conceive, be to
ascertain whether the value of x which it would afford would, in general, fall
within the limits of the value of c, as determined by the systems of equations
of which the system (4), (5), presents the type. It seems probable that under
ordinary circumstances this would be the case. Independently of such considerations,
however, we may regard (7) as itself the expression of a certain principle
of solution, viz., that regarding X1, X2, . . . Xm as exclusive causes of the event
whose probability is x, we accept the probabilities of those causes a1, a2, . . . am
from experience, but form the conditional probabilities of the event as dependent
upon such causes,
(xX1)
x1
,
(xX2)
X2
, &c. (XVII. Prop i.)
on the hypothesis of the independence of individual judgments, and so deduce
the equation (7). I conceive this, however, to be a less rigorous, though possibly,
in practice a more convenient mode of procedure than that adopted in the
general solution.
12. It now only remains to assign the particular forms which the algebraic
functions Xi
, (xXi), &c. in the above equations assume when the logical function
Xi represents that event which consists in r members of the assembly
voting one way, and n - r members the other way. It is evident that in this
case the algebraic function Xi expresses what the probability of the supposed
event would be were the events x1, x2, . . . xn independent, and their common
probability measured by x. Hence we should have, by Art. 3,
Xi =
n(n - 1). . .(n - r + 1)
1  2 . . . r
{x
r + (1 - x)
n-r
}.
Under the same circumstances (xXi) would represent the probability of the
compound event, which consists in a particular member of the assembly forming
a correct judgment, conjointly with the general state of voting recorded above.
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 309
It would, therefore, be the probability that a particular member votes correctly,
while of the remaining n - 1 members, r - 1 vote correctly; or that the same
member votes correctly, while of the remaining n-1 members r vote incorrectly.
Hence
(xXi) = (n - 1)(n - 2). . .(n - r + 1)
1  2 . . . r - 1

r +
(n - 1)(n - 2). . .(n - r)

.
Proposition IV.
13. Given any system of probabilities drawn from recorded instances of unanimity,
or of assigned numerical majority in the decisions of a criminal court
of justice, required upon hypotheses similar to those of the last proposition, the
mean probability c of correct judgment for a member of the court, and the general
probability k of guilt in an accused person.
The solution of this problem differs in but a slight degree from that of the
last, and may be referred to the same general formulæ, (4) and (5), or (7). It is
to be observed, that as there are two elements, c and k, to be determined, it is
necessary to reserve two of the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm-1, let us suppose X1,
and Xm-1, for final comparison, employing either the remaining m-3 functions
in the expression of the data, or the two respective sets X2, X3, . . . Xm-1, and
X1, X2, . . . Xm-2. In either case it is supposed that there must be at least two
original independent data. If the equation (7) be alone employed, it would in
the present instance furnish two equations, which may thus be written:
a1(xX1)
X1
+
a2(xX2)
X2
. . . +
am(xXm)
Xm
= x, (1)
a1(kX1)
X1
+
a2(kX2)
X2
. . . +
am(kXm)
Xm
= k. (2)
These equations are to be employed in the following manner:— Let x1, x2, . . . xn
represent those events which consist in the formation of a correct opinion by
the members of the court respectively. Let also w represent that event which
consists in the guilt of the accused member. By the aid of these symbols we can
logically express the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm-1, whose probabilities are given,
as also the function Xm. Then from the function X1 select those constituents
which contain, as a factor, any particular symbol of the set x1, x2, . . . xn, and
also those constituents which contain as a factor w. In both results change
x1, x2, . . . xn severally into x, and w into k. The above results will give (xX1)
and (kX1). Effecting the same transformations throughout, the system (1), (2)
will, upon the particular hypothesis involved, determine x and k.
14. We may collect from the above investigations the following facts and
conclusions:
1st. That from the mere records of agreement and disagreement in the
opinions of any body of men, no definite numerical conclusions can be drawn
respecting either the probability of correct judgment in an individual member
of the body, or the merit of the questions submitted to its consideration.
CHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 310
2nd. That such conclusions may be drawn upon various distinct hypotheses,
as—1st, Upon the usual hypothesis of the absolute independence of individual
judgments; 2ndly, upon certain definite modifications of that hypothesis warranted
by the actual data; 3rdly, upon a distinct principle of solution suggested
by the appearance of a common form in the solutions obtained by the modifi-
cations above adverted to.
Lastly. That whatever of doubt may attach to the final results, rests not
upon the imperfection of the method, which adapts itself equally to all hypotheses,
but upon the uncertainty of the hypotheses themselves.
It seems, however, probable that with even the widest limits of hypothesis,
consistent with the taking into account of all the data of experience, the deviation
of the results obtained would be but slight, and that their mean values
might be determined with great confidence by the methods of Prop. iii. Of
those methods I should be disposed to give the preference to the first. Such a
principle of mean solution having been agreed upon, other considerations seem
to indicate that the values of c and k for tribunals and assemblies possessing a
definite constitution, and governed in their deliberations by fixed rules, would
remain nearly constant, subject, however, to a small secular variation, dependent
upon the progress of knowledge and of justice among mankind. There exist
at present few, if any, data proper for their determination.
Chapter XXII
ON THE NATURE OF SCIENCE, AND THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT.
1. What I mean by the constitution of a system is the aggregate of those
causes and tendencies which produce its observed character, when operating,
without interference, under those conditions to which the system is conceived
to be adapted. Our judgment of such adaptation must be founded upon a study
of the circumstances in which the system attains its freest action, produces its
most harmonious results, or fulfils in some other way the apparent design of its
construction. There are cases in which we know distinctly the causes upon which
the operation of a system depends, as well as its conditions and its end. This is
the most perfect kind of knowledge relatively to the subject under consideration.
There are also cases in which we know only imperfectly or partially the causes
which are at work, but are able, nevertheless, to determine to some extent the
laws of their action, and, beyond this, to discover general tendencies, and to
infer ulterior purpose. It has thus, I think rightly, been concluded that there
is a moral faculty in our nature, not because we can understand the special
instruments by which it works, as we connect the organ with the faculty of
sight, nor upon the ground that men agree in the adoption of universal rules
of conduct; but because while, in some form or other, the sentiment of moral
approbation or disapprobation manifests itself in all, it tends, wherever human
progress is observable, wherever society is not either stationary or hastening to
decay, to attach itself to certain classes of actions, consentaneously, and after a
manner indicative both of permanency and of law. Always and everywhere the
manifestation of Order affords a presumption, not measurable indeed, but real
(XX. 22), of the fulfilment of an end or purpose, and the existence of a ground
of orderly causation.
2. The particular question of the constitution of the intellect has, it is
almost needless to say, attracted the efforts of speculative ingenuity in every
age. For it not only addresses itself to that desire of knowledge which the
greatest masters of ancient thought believed to be innate in our species, but
it adds to the ordinary strength of this motive the inducement of a human
and personal interest. A genuine devotion to truth is, indeed, seldom partial
in its aims, but while it prompts to expatiate over the fair fields of outward
311
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 312
observation, forbids to neglect the study of our own faculties. Even in ages the
most devoted to material interests, some portion of the current of thought has
been reflected inwards, and the desire to comprehend that by which all else is
comprehended has only been baffled in order to be renewed.
It is probable that this pertinacity of effort would not have been maintained
among sincere inquirers after truth, had the conviction been general that such
speculations are hopelessly barren. We may conceive that it has been felt that
if something of error and uncertainty, always incidental to a state of partial
information, must ever be attached to the results of such inquiries, a residue of
positive knowledge may yet remain; that the contradictions which are met with
are more often verbal than real; above all, that even probable conclusions derive
here an interest and a value from their subject, which render them not unworthy
to claim regard beside the more definite and more splendid results of physical
science. Such considerations seem to be perfectly legitimate. Insoluble as many
of the problems connected with the inquiry into the nature and constitution of
the mind must be presumed to be, there are not wanting others upon which
a limited but not doubtful knowledge, others upon which the conclusions of a
highly probable analogy, are attainable. As the realms of day and night are not
strictly conterminous, but are separated by a crepuscular zone, through which
the light of the one fades gradually off into the darkness of the other, so it may
be said that every region of positive knowledge lies surrounded by a debateable
and speculative territory, over which it in some degree extends its influence
and its light. Thus there may be questions relating to the constitution of the
intellect which, though they do not admit, in the present state of knowledge, of
an absolute decision, may receive so much of reflected information as to render
their probable solution not difficult; and there may also be questions relating
to the nature of science, and even to particular truths and doctrines of science,
upon which they who accept the general principles of this work cannot but be
led to entertain positive opinions, differing, it may be, from those which are
usually received in the present day.1
In what follows I shall recapitulate some
of the more definite conclusions established in the former parts of this treatise,
and shall then indicate one or two trains of thought, connected with the general
objects above adverted to, which they seem to me calculated to suggest.
3. Among those conclusions, relating to the intellectual constitution, which
may be considered as belonging to the realm of positive knowledge, we may
reckon the scientific laws of thought and reasoning, which have formed the basis
of the general methods of this treatise, together with the principles, Chap, v., by
which their application has been determined. The resolution of the domain of
thought into two spheres, distinct but coexistent (IV. XI.); the subjection of the
1The following illustration may suffice:–
It is maintained by some of the highest modern authorities in grammar that conjunctions
connect propositions only. Now, without inquiring directly whether this opinion is sound or
not, it is obvious that it cannot consistently be held by any who admit the scientific principles
of this treatise; for to such it would seem to involve a denial, either, 1st, of the possibility of
performing, or 2ndly, of the possibility of expressinq, a mental operation, the laws of which,
viewed in both these relations, have been investigated and applied in the present work—
(Latham on the English Language; Sir John Stoddart’s Universal Grammar, &c.)
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 313
intellectual operations within those spheres to a common system of laws (XI.);
the general mathematical character of those laws, and their actual expression
(II. III.); the extent of their affinity with the laws of thought in the domain of
number, and the point of their divergence therefrom; the dominant character
of the two limiting conceptions of universe and eternity among all the subjects
of thought with which Logic is concerned; the relation of those conceptions to
the fundamental conception of unity in the science of number,— these, with
many similar results, are not to be ranked as merely probable or analogical
conclusions, but are entitled to be regarded as truths of science. Whether they
be termed metaphysical or not, is a matter of indifference. The nature of the
evidence upon which they rest, though in kind distinct, is not inferior in value to
any which can be adduced in support of the general truths of physical science.
Again, it is agreed that there is a certain order observable in the progress of
all the exacter forms of knowledge. The study of every department of physical
science begins with observation, it advances by the collation of facts to a presumptive
acquaintance with their connecting law, the validity of such presumption
it tests by new experiments so devised as to augment, if the presumption be
well founded, its probability indefinitely; and finally, the law of the phænomenon
having been with sufficient confidence determined, the investigation of causes,
conducted by the due mixture of hypothesis and deduction, crowns the inquiry.
In this advancing order of knowledge, the particular faculties and laws whose
nature has been considered in this work bear their part. It is evident, therefore,
that if we would impartially investigate either the nature of science, or the intellectual
constitution in its relation to science, no part of the two series above
presented ought to be regarded as isolated. More especially ought those truths
which stand in any kind of supplemental relation to each other to be considered
in their mutual bearing and connexion.
4. Thus the necessity of an experimental basis for all positive knowledge,
viewed in connexion with the existence and the peculiar character of that system
of mental laws, and principles, and operations, to which attention has been
directed, tends to throw light upon some important questions by which the
world of speculative thought is still in a great measure divided. How, from the
particular facts which experience presents, do we arrive at the general propositions
of science? What is the nature of these propositions? Are they solely the
collections of experience, or does the mind supply some connecting principle of
its own? In a word, what is the nature of scientific truth, and what are the
grounds of that confidence with which it claims to be received?
That to such questions as the above, no single and general answer can be
given, must be evident. There are cases in which they do not even need discussion.
Instances are familiar, in which general propositions merely express
per enumerationem simplicem, a fact established by actual observation in all
the cases to which the proposition applies. The astronomer asserts upon this
ground, that all the known planets move from west to east round the sun. But
there are also cases in which general propositions are assumed from observation
of their truth in particular instances, and extension of that truth to instances
unobserved. No principle of merely deductive reasoning can warrant such a
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 314
procedure. When from a large number of observations on the planet Mars, Kepler
inferred that it revolved in an ellipse, the conclusion was larger than his
premises, or indeed than any premises which mere observation could give. What
other element, then, is necessary to give even a prospective validity to such generalizations
as this? It is the ability inherent in our nature to appreciate Order,
and the concurrent presumption, however founded, that the phænomena of Nature
are connected by a principle of Order. Without these, the general truths of
physical science could never have been ascertained. Grant that the procedure
thus established can only conduct us to probable or to approximate results; it
only follows, that the larger number of the generalizations of physical science
possess but a probable or approximate truth. The security of the tenure of
knowledge consists in this, that wheresoever such conclusions do truly represent
the constitution of Nature, our confidence in their truth receives indefinite confirmation,
and soon becomes undistinguishable from certainty. The existence of
that principle above represented as the basis of inductive reasoning enables us
to solve the much disputed question as to the necessity of general propositions
in reasoning. The logician affirms, that it is impossible to deduce any conclusion
from particular premises. Modern writers of high repute have contended,
that all reasoning is from particular to particular truths. They instance, that in
concluding from the possession of a property by certain members of a class, its
possession by some other member, it is not necessary to establish the intermediate
general conclusion which affirms its possession by all the members of the
class in common. Now whether it is so or not, that principle of order or analogy
upon which the reasoning is conducted must either be stated or apprehended
as a general truth, to give validity to the final conclusion. In this form, at least,
the necessity of general propositions as the basis of inference is confirmed,—a
necessity which, however, I conceive to be involved in the very existence, and
still more in the peculiar nature, of those faculties whose laws have been investigated
in this work. For if the process of reasoning be carefully analyzed, it will
appear that abstraction is made of all peculiarities of the individual to which
the conclusion refers, and the attention confined to those properties by which
its membership of the class is defined.
5. But besides the general propositions which are derived by induction from
the collated facts of experience, there exist others belonging to the domain of
what is termed necessary truth. Such are the general propositions of Arithmetic,
as well as the propositions expressing the laws of thought upon which the general
methods of this treatise are founded; and these propositions are not only capable
of being rigorously verified in particular instances, but are made manifest in all
their generality from the study of particular instances. Again, there exist general
propositions expressive of necessary truths, but incapable, from the imperfection
of the senses, of being exactly verified. Some, if not all, of the propositions of
Geometry are of this nature; but it is not in the region of Geometry alone
that such propositions are found. The question concerning their nature and
origin is a very ancient one, and as it is more intimately connected with the
inquiry into the constitution of the intellect than any other to which allusion
has been made, it will not be irrelevant to consider it here. Among the opinions
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 315
which have most widely prevailed upon the subject are the following. It has
been maintained, that propositions of the class referred to exist in the mind
independently of experience, and that those conceptions which are the subjects
of them are the imprints of eternal archetypes. With such archetypes, conceived,
however, to possess a reality of which all the objects of sense are but a faint
shadow or dim suggestion, Plato furnished his ideal world. It has, on the other
hand, been variously contended, that the subjects of such propositions are copies
of individual objects of experience; that they are mere names; that they are
individual objects of experience themselves; and that the propositions which
relate to them are, on account of the imperfection of those objects, but partially
true; lastly, that they are intellectual products formed by abstraction from the
sensible perceptions of individual things, but so formed as to become, what
the individual things never can be, subjects of science, i.e. subjects concerning
which exact and general propositions may be affirmed. And there exist, perhaps,
yet other views, in some of which the sensible, in others the intellectual or ideal,
element predominates.
Now if the last of the views above adverted to be taken (for it is not proposed
to consider either the purely ideal or the purely nominalist view) and if
it be inquired what, in the sense above stated, are the proper objects of science,
objects in relation to which its propositions are true without any mixture of
error, it is conceived that but one answer can be given. It is, that neither do
individual objects of experience, nor with all probability do the mental images
which they suggest, possess any strict claim to this title. It seems to be certain,
that neither in nature nor in art do we meet with anything absolutely agreeing
with the geometrical definition of a straight line, or of a triangle, or of a circle,
though the deviation therefrom may be inappreciable by sense; and it may be
conceived as at least doubtful, whether we can form a perfect mental image,
or conception, with which the agreement shall be more exact. But it is not
doubtful that such conceptions, however imperfect, do point to something beyond
themselves, in the gradual approach towards which all imperfection tends
to disappear. Although the perfect triangle, or square, or circle, exists not in
nature, eludes all our powers of representative conception, and is presented to
us in thought only, as the limit of an indefinite process of abstraction, yet, by a
wonderful faculty of the understanding, it may be made the subject of propositions
which are absolutely true. The domain of reason is thus revealed to us
as larger than that of imagination. Should any, indeed, think that we are able
to picture to ourselves, with rigid accuracy, the scientific elements of form, direction,
magnitude, &c., these things, as actually conceived, will, in the view of
such persons, be the proper objects of science. But if, as seems to me the more
just opinion, an incurable imperfection attaches to all our attempts to realize
with precision these elements, then we can only affirm, that the more external
objects do approach in reality, or the conceptions of fancy by abstraction, to
certain limiting states, never, it may be, actually attained, the more do the
general propositions of science concerning those things or conceptions approach
to absolute truth, the actual deviation therefrom tending to disappear. To some
extent, the same observations are applicable also to the physical sciences. What
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 316
have been termed the “fundamental ideas” of those sciences as force, polarity,
crystallization, &c.,2are neither, as I conceive, intellectual products independent
of experience, nor mere copies of external things; but while, on the one
hand, they have a necessary antecedent in experience, on the other hand they
require for their formation the exercise of the power of abstraction, in obedience
to some general faculty or disposition of our nature, which ever prompts us
to the research, and qualifies us for the appreciation, of order.3Thus we study
approximately the effects of gravitation on the motions of the heavenly bodies,
by a reference to the limiting supposition, that the planets are perfect spheres
or spheroids. We determine approximately the path of a ray of light through
the atmosphere, by a process in which abstraction is made of all disturbing
influences of temperature. And such is the order of procedure in all the higher
walks of human knowledge. Now what is remarkable in connexion with these
processes of the intellect is the disposition, and the corresponding ability, to
ascend from the imperfect representations of sense and the diversities of individual
experience, to the perception of general, and it may be of immutable
truths. Whereever this disposition and this ability unite, each series of connected
facts in nature may furnish the intimations of an order more exact than
that which it directly manifests. For it may serve as ground and occasion for the
exercise of those powers, whose office it is to apprehend the general truths which
are indeed exemplified, but never with perfect fidelity, in a world of changeful
phænomena.
6. The truth that the ultimate laws of thought are mathematical in their
form, viewed in connexion with the fact of the possibility of error, establishes a
ground for some remarkable conclusions. If we directed our attention to the scientific
truth alone, we might be led to infer an almost exact parallelism between
the intellectual operations and the movements of external nature. Suppose any
one conversant with physical science, but unaccustomed to reflect upon the nature
of his own faculties, to have been informed, that it had been proved, that
the laws of those faculties were mathematical; it is probable that after the first
feelings of incredulity had subsided, the impression would arise, that the order
of thought must, therefore, be as necessary as that of the material universe.
We know that in the realm of natural science, the absolute connexion between
2Whewell’s Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, pp. 71, 77, 213.
3Of the idea of order it has been profoundly said, that it carries within itself its own
justification or its own control, the very trustworthiness of our faculties being judged by the
conformity of their results to an order which satisfies the reason. “L’id´ee de l’ordre a cela
de singulier et d’eminent, qu’elle porte en elle mˆeme sa justification ou son contrˆole. Pour
trouver si nos autres facult´es nous trompent ou nous ne trompent pas, nous examinons si
les notions qu’elles nous donnent s’enchaˆinent on ne s’enchaˆinent pas suivant un ordre qui
satisfasse la raison.”—Cournot, Essai sur les fondements de nos Connaissances. Admitting
this principle as the guide of those powers of abstraction which we undoubtedly possess, it
seems unphilosophical to assume that the fundamental ideas of the sciences are not derivable
from experience. Doubtless the capacities which have been given to us for the comprehension
of the actual world would avail us in a differently constituted scene, if in some form or other
the dominion of order was still maintained. It is conceivable that in such a new theatre of
speculation, the laws of the intellectual procedure remaining the same, the fundamental ideas
of the sciences might be wholly different from those with which we are at present acquainted.
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 317
the initial and final elements of a problem, exhibited in the mathematical form,
fitly symbolizes that physical necessity which binds together effect and cause.
The necessary sequence of states and conditions in the inorganic world, and
the necessary connexion of premises and conclusion in the processes of exact
demonstration thereto applied, seem to be co-ordinate. It may possibly be a
question, to which of the two series the primary application of the term “necessary”
is due; whether to the observed constancy of Nature, or to the indissoluble
connexion of propositions in all valid reasoning upon her works. Historically we
should perhaps give the preference to the former, philosophically to the latter
view. But the fact of the connexion is indisputable, and the analogy to which
it points is obvious.
Were, then, the laws of valid reasoning uniformly obeyed, a very close parallelism
would exist between the operations of the intellect and those of external
Nature. Subjection to laws mathematical in their form and expression, even
the subjection of an absolute obedience, would stamp upon the two series one
common character. The reign of necessity over the intellectual and the physical
world would be alike complete and universal.
But while the observation of external Nature testifies with ever-strengthening
evidence to the fact, that uniformity of operation and unvarying obedience to
appointed laws prevail throughout her entire domain, the slightest attention to
the processes of the intellectual world reveals to us another state of things. The
mathematical laws of reasoning are, properly speaking, the laws of right reasoning
only, and their actual transgression is a perpetually recurring phenomenon.
Error, which has no place in the material system, occupies a large one here.
We must accept this as one of those ultimate facts, the origin of which it lies
beyond the province of science to determine. We must admit that there exist
laws which even the rigour of their mathematical forms does not preserve from
violation. We must ascribe to them an authority the essence of which does not
consist in power, a supremacy which the analogy of the inviolable order of the
natural world in no way assists us to comprehend.
As the distinction thus pointed out is real, it remains unaffected by any
peculiarity in our views respecting other portions of the mental constitution. If
we regard the intellect as free, and this is apparently the view most in accordance
with the general spirit of these speculations, its freedom must be viewed as
opposed to the dominion of necessity, not to the existence of a certain just
supremacy of truth. The laws of correct inference may be violated, but they
do not the less truly exist on this account. Equally do they remain unaffected
in character and authority if the hypothesis of necessity in its extreme form be
adopted. Let it be granted that the laws of valid reasoning, such as they are
determined to be in this work, or, to speak more generally, such as they would
finally appear in the conclusions of an exhaustive analysis, form but a part of
the system of laws by which the actual processes of reasoning, whether right or
wrong, are governed. Let it be granted that if that system were known to us in
its completeness, we should perceive that the whole intellectual procedure was
necessary, even as the movements of the inorganic world are necessary. And let
it finally, as a consequence of this hypothesis, be granted that the phænomena of
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 318
incorrect reasoning or error, wheresoever presented, are due to the interference
of other laws with those laws of which right reasoning is the product. Still it
would remain that there exist among the intellectual laws a number marked
out from the rest by this special character, viz., that every movement of the
intellectual system which is accomplished solely under their direction is right,
that every interference therewith by other laws is not interference only, but
violation. It cannot but be felt that this circumstance would give to the laws in
question a character of distinction and of predominance. They would but the
more evidently seem to indicate a final purpose which is not always fulfilled, to
possess an authority inherent and just, but not always commanding obedience.
Now a little consideration will show that there is nothing analogous to this
in the government of the world by natural law. The realm of inorganic Nature
admits neither of preference nor of distinctions. We cannot separate any portion
of her laws from the rest, and pronounce them alone worthy of obedience,—
alone charged with the fulfilment of her highest purpose. On the contrary, all
her laws seem to stand co-ordinate, and the larger our acquaintance with them,
the more necessary does their united action seem to the harmony and, so far
as we can comprehend it, to the general design of the system. How often the
most signal departures from apparent order in the inorganic world, such as
the perturbations of the planetary system, the interruption of the process of
crystallization by the intrusion of a foreign force, and others of a like nature,
either merge into the conception of some more exalted scheme of order, or lose
to a more attentive and instructed gaze their abnormal aspect, it is needless
to remark. One explanation only of these facts can be given, viz., that the
distinction between true and false, between correct and incorrect, exists in the
processes of the intellect, but not in the region of a physical necessity. As we
advance from the lower stages of organic being to the higher grade of conscious
intelligence, this contrast gradually dawns upon us. Wherever the phænomena
of life are manifested, the dominion of rigid law in some degree yields to that
mysterious principle of activity. Thus, although the structure of the animal
tribes is conformable to certain general types, yet are those types sometimes,
perhaps, in relation to the highest standards of beauty and proportion, always,
imperfectly realized. The two alternatives, between which Art in the present
day fluctuates, are the exact imitation of individual forms, and the endeavour,
by abstraction from all such, to arrive at the conception of an ideal grace and
expression, never, it may be, perfectly manifested in forms of earthly mould.
Again, those teleological adaptations by which, without the organic type being
sacrificed, species become fitted to new conditions or abodes, are but slowly
accomplished,—accomplished, however, not, apparently, by the fateful power of
external circumstances, but by the calling forth of an energy from within. Life in
all its forms may thus be contrasted with the passive fixity of inorganic nature.
But inasmuch as the perfection of the types in which it is corporeally manifested
is in some measure of an ideal character, inasmuch as we cannot precisely define
the highest suggested excellency of form and of adaptation, the contrast is less
marked here than that which exists between the intellectual processes and those
of the purely material world. For the definite and technical character of the
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 319
mathematical laws by which both are governed, places in stronger light the
fundamental difference between the kind of authority which, in their capacity
of government, they respectively exercise.
7. There is yet another instance connected with the general objects of this
chapter, in which the collation of truths or facts, drawn from different sources,
suggests an instructive train of reflection. It consists in the comparison of the
laws of thought, in their scientific expression, with the actual forms which physical
speculation in early ages, and metaphysical speculation in all ages, have
tended to assume. There are two illustrations of this remark, to which, in
particular, I wish to direct attention here.
1st. It has been shown (III. 13) that there is a scientific connexion between
the conceptions of unity in Number, and the universe in Logic. They occupy
in their respective systems the same relative place, and are subject to the same
formal laws. Now to the Greek mind, in that early stage of activity,—a stage
not less marked, perhaps not less necessary, in the progression of the human
intellect, than the era of Bacon or of Newton,—when the great problems of
Nature began to unfold themselves, while the means of observation were as
yet wanting, and its necessity not understood, the terms “Universe” and “The
One” seem to have been regarded as almost identical. To assign the nature
of that unity of which all existence was thought to be a manifestation, was
the first aim of philosophy.4 Thales sought for this fundamental unity in water.
Anaximenes and Diogenes conceived it to be air. Hippasus of Metapontum,
and Heraclitus the Ephesian, pronounced that it was fire. Less definite or less
confident in his views, Parmenides simply declared that all existing things were
One; Melissus that the Universe was infinite, unsusceptible of change or motion,
One, like to itself, and that motion was not, but seemed to be.5
In a spirit which,
to the reflective mind of Aristotle, appeared sober when contrasted with the
rashness of previous speculation, Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, following, perhaps,
the steps of his fellow-citizen, Hermotimus, sought in Intelligence the cause of
the world and of its order.6 The pantheistic tendency which pervaded many of
these speculations is manifest in the language of Xenophanes, the founder of
the Eleatic school, who, “surveying the expanse of heaven, declared that the
One was God.”7 Perhaps there are few, if any, of the forms in which unity
can be conceived, in the abstract as numerical or rational, in the concrete as
a passive substance, or a central and living principle, of which we do not meet
with applications in these ancient doctrines. The writings of Aristotle, to which
I have chiefly referred, abound with allusions of this nature, though of the

larger number of those who once addicted themselves to such speculations, it
is probable that the very names have perished. Strange, but suggestive truth,
that while Nature in all but the aspect of the heavens must have appeared as
little else than a scene of unexplained disorder, while the popular belief was
distracted amid the multiplicity of its gods, —the conception of a primal unity,
if only in a rude, material form, should have struck deepest root; surviving in
many a thoughtful breast the chills of a lifelong disappointment, and an endless
search!8
2ndly. In equally intimate alliance with that law of thought which is expressed
by an equation of the second degree, and which has been termed in this
treatise the law of duality, stands the tendency of ancient thought to those forms
of philosophical speculation which are known under the name of dualism. The
theory of Empedocles,9 which explained the apparent contradictions of nature
by referring them to the two opposing principles of “strife” and “friendship;”
and the theory of Leucippus,10 which resolved all existence into the two elements
of a plenum and a vacuum, are of this nature. The famous comparison of
the universe to a lyre or a bow,11 its “recurrent harmony” being the product of
opposite states of tension, betrays the same origin. In the system of Pythagoras,
which seems to have been a combination of dualism with other elements
derived from the study of numbers, and of their relations, ten fundamental antitheses
are recognised: finite and infinite, even and odd, unity and multitude,
right and left, male and female, rest and motion, straight and curved, light and
darkness, good and evil, the square and the oblong. In that of Alcmæon the
same fundamental dualism is accepted, but without the definite and numerical
limitation with which it is connected in the Pythagorean system. The grand
development of this idea is, however, met with in that ancient Manichæan doctrine,
which not only formed the basis of the religious system of Persia, but
spread widely through other regions of the East, and became memorable in
the history of the Christian Church. The origin of dualism as a speculative

opinion, not yet connected with the personification of the Evil Principle, but
naturally succeeding those doctrines which had assumed the primal unity of
Nature, is thus stated by Aristotle:—“Since there manifestly existed in Nature
things opposite to the good, and not only order and beauty, but also disorder
and deformity; and since the evil things did manifestly preponderate in number
over the good, and the deformed over the beautiful, some one else at length
introduced strife and friendship as the respective causes of these diverse phænornena.”12And
in Greece, indeed, it seems to have been chiefly as a philosophical
opinion, or as an adjunct to philosophical speculation, that the dualistic theory
obtained ground.13The moral application of the doctrine most in accordance
with the Greek mind is preserved in the great Platonic antithesis of ”being and
non-being,”—the connexion of the former with whatsoever is good and true,
with the eternal ideas, and the archetypal world: of the latter with evil, with
error, with the perishable phænomena of the present scene. The two forms of
speculation which we have considered were here blended together; nor was it
during the youth and maturity of Greek philosophy alone that the tendencies
of thought above described were manifested. Ages of imitation caught up and
adopted as their own the same spirit. Especially wherever the genius of Plato
exercised sway was this influence felt. The unity of all real being, its identity
with truth and goodness considered as to their essence; the illusion, the profound
unreality, of all merely phænomenal existence; such were the views,—such
the dispositions of thought, which it chiefly tended to foster. Hence that strong
tendency to mysticism which, when the days of renown, whether on the field of
intellectual or on that of social enterprise, had ended in Greece, became prevalent
in her schools of philosophy, and reached their culminating point among
the Alexandrian Platonists. The supposititious treatises of Dionysius the Areopagite
served to convey the same influence, much modified by its contact with
Aristotelian doctrines, to the scholastic disputants of the middle ages. It can
furnish no just ground of controversy to say, that the tone of thought thus
encouraged was as little consistent with genuine devotion as with a sober philosophy.
That kindly influence of human affections, that homely intercourse
with the common things of life, which form so large a part of the true, because
intended, discipline of our nature, would be ill replaced by the contemplation
even of the highest object of thought, viewed by an excessive abstraction as
something concerning which not a single intelligible proposition could either be
affirmed or denied.14I would but slightly allude to those connected speculations
on the Divine Nature which ascribed to it the perfect union of opposite qualities,15or
to the remarkable treatises of Anselm, designed to establish a theory

of the universe upon the analogies of thought and being.16 The primal unity is
there represented as having its abode in the one eternal Truth. The conformity
of Nature to her laws, the obedience of moral agents to the dictates of rectitude,
are the same Truth seen in action; the world itself being but an expression of
the self-reflecting thought of its Author.17Still more marked was the revival of
the older forms of speculation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
The friends and associates of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the recluses known in
England as the Cambridge Platonists, together with many meditative spirits
scattered through Europe, devoted themselves anew, either to the task of solving
the ancient problem, De Uno, Vero, Bono, or to that of proving that all
such inquiries are futile and vain.18The logical elements which underlie all these
speculations, and from which they appear to borrow at least their form, it would
be easy to trace in the outlines of more modern systems,–more especially in that
association of the doctrine of the absolute unity with the distinction of the ego
and the non-ego as the type of Nature, which forms the basis of the philosophy
of Hegel. The attempts of speculative minds to ascend to some high pinnacle
of truth, from which they might survey the entire framework and connexion of
things in the order of deductive thought, have differed less in the forms of theory
which they have produced, than through the nature of the interpretations
which have been assigned to those forms.19And herein lies the real question as
to the influence of philosophical systems upon the disposition and the life. For
though it is of slight moment that men should agree in tracing back all the
forms and conditions of being to a primal unity, it is otherwise as concerns their
conceptions of what that unity is, and what are the kinds of relation, beside that
of mere causality, which it sustains to themselves. Herein too may be felt the
Sacred Latin Poetry.) The principle upon which all these speculations rest is thus stated in
the treatise referred to in the last note. ??de? ??? ?at?p??, e? aµ?d??? e?????? ep? t?

nature are chiefly in connexion with aesthetics, the ground of the application being contained
in the formula of Augustine: ”Omnis porro pulchritudinis forma, unitas est.”
19For instance, the learned mysticism of Gioberti, widely as it differs in its spirit and its
conclusions from the pantheism of Hegel (both being, perhaps, equally remote from truth),
resembles it in applying both to thought and to being the principles of unity and duality. It
is asked:—”Or non `e egli chiaro che ogni discorso si riduce in fine in fine alle idee di Dio, del
mondo, e della creazione, l’ultima delle quali `e il legame delle due prime?” And this question
being affirmatively answered in the formula, ”l’Ente crea le esistenze,” it is said of that
formula,—”Essa abbraccia la realt`a universale nella dualit`a del necessario e del contingente,
esprime il vincolo di questi due ordini, e collocandolo nella creazion sostanziale, riduce la
dualit`a reale a un principio unico, all unit`a primordiale dell’Ente non astratto, complessivo, e
generico, ma concreto, individuato, assoluto, e creatore.”—Del Bello e del Buono, pp. 30, 31.
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 323
powerlessness of mere Logic, the insufficiency of the profoundest knowledge of
the laws of the understanding, to resolve those problems which lie nearer to our
hearts, as progressive years strip away from our life the illusions of its golden
dawn.
8. If the extremely arbitrary character of human opinion be considered, it
will not be expected, nor is it here maintained, that the above are the only
forms in which speculative men have shaped their conjectural solutions of the
problem of existence. Under particular influences other forms of doctrine have
arisen, not unfrequently, however, masking those portrayed above.20
But the wide prevalence of the particular theories which we have considered,
together with their manifest analogy with the expressed laws of thought, may
justly be conceived to indicate a connexion between the two systems. As all
other mental acts and procedures are beset by their peculiar fallacies, so the
operation of that law of thought termed in this work the law of duality may
have its own peculiar tendency to error, exalting mere want of agreement into
contrariety, and thus form a world which we necessarily view as formed of parts
supplemental to each other, framing the conception of a world fundamentally
divided by opposing powers. Such, with some large but hasty inductions from
phænomena, may have been the origin of dualism,—independently of the question
whether dualism is in any form a true theory or not. Here, however, it is
of more importance to consider in detail the bearing of these ancient forms of
speculation, as revived in the present day, upon the progress of real knowledge;
and upon this point I desire, in pursuance of what has been said in the previous
section, to add the following remarks:
1st. All sound philosophy gives its verdict against such speculations, if regarded
as a means of determining the actual constitution of things. It may be
that the progress of natural knowledge tends towards the recognition of some
central Unity in Nature. Of such unity as consists in the mutual relation of the
parts of a system there can be little doubt, and able men have speculated, not
without grounds, on a more intimate correlation of physical forces than the mere
idea of a system would lead us to conjecture. Further, it may be that in the bosom
of that supposed unity are involved some general principles of division and
re-union, the sources, under the Supreme Will, of much of the related variety of
Nature. The instances of sex and polarity have been adduced in support of such
a view. As a supposition, I will venture to add, that it is not very improbable
that, in some such way as this, the constitution of things without may correspond
to that of the mind within. But such correspondence, if it shall ever be
proved to exist, will appear as the last induction from human knowledge, not as
the first principle of scientific inquiry. The natural order of discovery is from the
20Evidence in support of this statement will be found in the remarkable treatise recently
published under the title (the correctness of which seems doubtful) of Origenis Philosophumena.
The early corruptions of Christianity of which it contains the record, though many
of them, as is evident from their Ophite character, derived from the very dregs of paganism,
manifest certain persistent forms of philosophical speculation. For the most part they either
belong to the dualistic scheme, or recognise three principles, primary or derived, between two
of which the dualistic relation may be traced—Orig. Phil., pp. 135, 139, 150, 235, 253, 264.
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 324
particular to the universal, and it may confidently be affirmed that we have not
yet advanced sufficiently far on this track to enable us to determine what are
the ultimate forms into which all the special differences of Nature shall merge,
and from which they shall receive their explanation.
2ndly. Were this correspondence between the forms of thought and the
actual constitution of Nature proved to exist, whatsoever connexion or relation
it might be supposed to establish between the two systems, it would in no degree
affect the question of their mutual independence. It would in no sense lead to
the consequence that the one system is the mere product of the other. A too
great addiction to metaphysical speculations seems, in some instances, to have
produced a tendency toward this species of illusion. Thus, among the many
attempts which have been made to explain the existence of evil, it has been
sought to assign to the fact a merely relative character,—to found it upon a
species of logical opposition to the equally relative element of good. It suffices
to say, that the assumption is purely gratuitous. What evil may be in the eyes of
Infinite wisdom and purity, we can at the best but dimly conjecture; but to us,
in all its forms, whether of pain or defect, or moral transgression, or retributory
wo, it can wear but one aspect,—that of a sad and stern reality, against which,
upon somewhat more than the highest order of prudential considerations, the
whole preventive force of our nature may be exerted. Now what has been said
upon the particular question just considered, is equally applicable to many other
of the debated points of philosophy; such, for instance, as the external reality of
space and time. We have no warrant for resolving these into mere forms of the
understanding, though they unquestionably determine the present sphere of our
knowledge. And, to speak more generally, there is no warrant for the extremely
subjective tendency of much modern speculation. Whenever, in the view of the
intellect, different hypotheses are equally consistent with an observed fact, the
instinctive testimony of consciousness as to their relative value must be allowed
to possess authority.
3rdly. If the study of the laws of thought avails us neither to determine the
actual constitution of things, nor to explain the facts involved in that constitution
which have perplexed the wise and saddened the thoughtful in all ages,—
still less does it enable us to rise above the present conditions of our being, or
lend its sanction to the doctrine which affirms the possibility of an intuitive
knowledge of the infinite, and the unconditioned,—whether such knowledge be
sought for in the realm of Nature, or above that realm. We can never be said
to comprehend that which is represented to thought as the limit of an indefi-
nite process of abstraction. A progression ad infinitum is impossible to finite
powers. But though we cannot comprehend the infinite, there may be even scientific
grounds for believing that human nature is constituted in some relation
to the infinite. We cannot perfectly express the laws of thought, or establish
in the most general sense the methods of which they form the basis, without
at least the implication of elements which ordinary language expresses by the
terms “Universe” and “Eternity.” As in the pure abstractions of Geometry, so
in the domain of Logic it is seen, that the empire of Truth is, in a certain sense,
larger than that of Imagination. And as there are many special departments of
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 325
knowledge which can only be completely surveyed from an external point, so
the theory of the intellectual processes, as applied only to finite objects, seems
to involve the recognition of a sphere of thought from which all limits are withdrawn.
If then, on the one hand, we cannot discover in the laws of thought
and their analogies a sufficient basis of proof for the conclusions of a too daring
mysticism; on the other hand we should err in regarding them as wholly
unsuggestive. As parts of our intellectual nature, it seems not improbable that
they should manifest their presence otherwise than by merely prescribing the
conditions of formal inference. Whatever grounds we have for connecting them
with the peculiar tendencies of physical speculation among the Ionian and Italic
philosophers, the same grounds exist for associating them with a disposition of
thought at once more common and more legitimate. To no casual influences, at
least, ought we to attribute that meditative spirit which then most delights to
commune with the external magnificence of Nature, when most impressed with
the consciousness of sempiternal verities,—which reads in the nocturnal heavens
a bright manifestation of order; or feels in some wild scene among the hills, the
intimations of more than that abstract eternity which had rolled away ere yet
their dark foundations were laid.21
9. Refraining from the further prosecution of a train of thought which to
some may appear to be of too speculative a character, let us briefly review
the positive results to which we have been led. It has appeared that there exist
in our nature faculties which enable us to ascend from the particular facts
of experience to the general propositions which form the basis of Science; as
well as faculties whose office it is to deduce from general propositions accepted
as true the particular conclusions which they involve. It has been seen, that
those faculties are subject in their operations to laws capable of precise scientific
expression, but invested with an authority which, as contrasted with the
authority of the laws of nature, is distinct, sui generis, and underived. Further,
there has appeared to be a manifest fitness between the intellectual procedure
thus made known to us, and the conditions of that system of things by which we
are surrounded,—such conditions, I mean, as the existence of species connected
by general resemblances, of facts associated under general laws; together with
that union of permanency with order, which while it gives stability to acquired
knowledge, lays a foundation for the hope of indefinite progression. Human
nature, quite independently of its observed or manifested tendencies, is seen to
be constituted in a certain relation to Truth; and this relation, considered as a
subject of speculative knowledge, is as capable of being studied in its details,
is, moreover, as worthy of being so studied, as are the several departments of
physical science, considered in the same aspect. I would especially direct attention
to that view of the constitution of the intellect which represents it as
subject to laws determinate in their character, but not operating by the power
of necessity; which exhibits it as redeemed from the dominion of fate, without
being abandoned to the lawlessness of chance. We cannot embrace this view
without accepting at least as probable the intimations which, upon the principle
21Psalm xc. 2
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 326
of analogy, it seems to furnish respecting another and a higher aspect of our
nature,—its subjection in the sphere of duty as well as in that of knowledge
to fixed laws whose authority does not consist in power,—its constitution with
reference to an ideal standard and a final purpose. It has been thought, indeed,
that scientific pursuits foster a disposition either to overlook the specific differences
between the moral and the material world, or to regard the former as in
no proper sense a subject for exact knowledge. Doubtless all exclusive pursuits
tend to produce partial views, and it may be, that a mind long and deeply
immersed in the contemplation of scenes over which the dominion of a physical
necessity is unquestioned and supreme, may admit with difficulty the possibility
of another order of things. But it is because of the exclusiveness of this devotion
to a particular sphere of knowledge, that the prejudice in question takes
possession, if at all, of the mind. The application of scientific methods to the
study of the intellectual phænomena, conducted in an impartial spirit of inquiry,
and without overlooking those elements of error and disturbance which must be
accepted as facts, though they cannot be regarded as laws, in the constitution
of our nature, seems to furnish the materials of a juster analogy.
10. If it be asked to what practical end such inquiries as the above point, it
may be replied, that there exist various objects, in relation to which the courses
of men’s actions are mainly determined by their speculative views of human
nature. Education, considered in its largest sense, is one of those objects. The
ultimate ground of all inquiry into its nature and its methods must be laid in
some previous theory of what man is, what are the ends for which his several
faculties were designed, what are the motives which have power to influence
them to sustained action, and to elicit their most perfect and most stable results.
It may be doubted, whether these questions have ever been considered fully,
and at the same time impartially, in the relations here suggested. The highest
cultivation of taste by the study of the pure models of antiquity, the largest
acquaintance with the facts and theories of modern physical science, viewed
from this larger aspect of our nature, can only appear as parts of a perfect
intellectual discipline. Looking from the same point of view upon the means to
be employed, we might be led to inquire, whether that all but exclusive appeal
which is made in the present day to the spirit of emulation or cupidity, does
not tend to weaken the influence of those more enduring motives which seem to
have been implanted in our nature for the immediate end in view. Upon these,
and upon many other questions, the just limits of authority, the reconciliation
of freedom of thought with discipline of feelings, habits, manners, and upon
the whole moral aspect of the question,—what unfixedness of opinion, what
diversity of practice, do we meet with! Yet, in the sober view of reason, there
is no object within the compass of human endeavours which is of more weight
and moment than this, considered, as I have said, in its largest meaning. Now,
whatsoever tends to make more exact and definite our view of human nature, in
any of its real aspects, tends, in the same proportion, to reduce these questions
into narrower compass, and restrict the limits of their possible solution. Thus
may even speculative inquiries prove fruitful of the most important principles
of action.
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 327
11. Perhaps the most obviously legitimate bearing of such speculations would
be upon the question of the place of Mathematics in the system of human knowledge,
and the nature and office of mathematical studies, as a means of intellectual
discipline. No one who has attended to the course of recent discussions can
think this question an unimportant one. Those who have maintained that the
position of Mathematics is in both respects a fundamental one, have drawn one
of their strongest arguments from the actual constitution of things. The material
frame is subject in all its parts to the relations of number. All dynamical, chemical,
electrical, thermal, actions, seem not only to be measurable in themselves,
but to be connected with each other, even to the extent of mutual convertibility,
by numerical relations of a perfectly definite kind. But the opinion in question
seems to me to rest upon a deeper basis than this. The laws of thought, in all
its processes of conception and of reasoning, in all those operations of which
language is the expression or the instrument, are of the same kind as are the
laws of the acknowledged processes of Mathematics. It is not contended that it
is necessary for us to acquaint ourselves with those laws in order to think coherently,
or, in the ordinary sense of the terms, to reason well. Men draw inferences
without any consciousness of those elements upon which the entire procedure
depends. Still less is it desired to exalt the reasoning faculty over the faculties
of observation, of reflection, and of judgment. But upon the very ground that
human thought, traced to its ultimate elements, reveals itself in mathematical
forms, we have a presumption that the mathematical sciences occupy, by the
constitution of our nature, a fundamental place in human knowledge, and that
no system of mental culture can be complete or fundamental, which altogether
neglects them.
But the very same class of considerations shows with equal force the error
of those who regard the study of Mathematics, and of their applications, as a
sufficient basis either of knowledge or of discipline. If the constitution of the
material frame is mathematical, it is not merely so. If the mind, in its capacity
of formal reasoning, obeys, whether consciously or unconsciously, mathematical
laws, it claims through its other capacities of sentiment and action, through its
perceptions of beauty and of moral fitness, through its deep springs of emotion
and affection, to hold relation to a different order of things. There is, moreover,
a breadth of intellectual vision, a power of sympathy with truth in all its forms
and manifestations, which is not measured by the force and subtlety of the
dialectic faculty. Even the revelation of the material universe in its boundless
magnitude, and pervading order, and constancy of law, is not necessarily the
most fully apprehended by him who has traced with minutest accuracy the steps
of the great demonstration. And if we embrace in our survey the interests and
duties of life, how little do any processes of mere ratiocination enable us to
comprehend the weightier questions which they present! As truly, therefore, as
the cultivation of the mathematical or deductive faculty is a part of intellectual
discipline, so truly is it only a part. The prejudice which would either banish
or make supreme any one department of knowledge or faculty of mind, betrays
not only error of judgment, but a defect of that intellectual modesty which is
inseparable from a pure devotion to truth. It assumes the office of criticising
CHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 328
a constitution of things which no human appointment has established, or can
annul. It sets aside the ancient and just conception of truth as one though
manifold. Much of this error, as actually existent among us, seems due to
the special and isolated character of scientific teaching—which character it,
in its turn, tends to foster. The study of philosophy, notwithstanding a few
marked instances of exception, has failed to keep pace with the advance of the
several departments of knowledge, whose mutual relations it is its province to
determine. It is impossible, however, not to contemplate the particular evil in
question as part of a larger system, and connect it with the too prevalent view of
knowledge as a merely secular thing, and with the undue predominance, already
adverted to, of those motives, legitimate within their proper limits, which are
founded upon a regard to its secular advantages. In the extreme case it is not
difficult to see that the continued operation of such motives, uncontrolled by
any higher principles of action, uncorrected by the personal influence of superior
minds, must tend to lower the standard of thought in reference to the objects
of knowledge, and to render void and ineffectual whatsoever elements of a noble
faith may still survive. And ever in proportion as these conditions are realized
must the same effects follow. Hence, perhaps, it is that we sometimes find juster
conceptions of the unity, the vital connexion, and the subordination to a moral
purpose, of the different parts of Truth, among those who acknowledge nothing
higher than the changing aspect of collective humanity, than among those who
profess an intellectual allegiance to the Father of Lights. But these are questions
which cannot further be pursued here. To some they will appear foreign to
the professed design of this work. But the consideration of them has arisen
naturally, either out of the speculations which that design involved, or in the
course of reading and reflection which seemed necessary to its accomplishment.
the end.

FLATLAND



PART 1

THIS WORLD



SECTION 1  Of the Nature of Flatland


I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its
nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in
Space.

Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles,
Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining
fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but
without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like
shadows--only hard with luminous edges--and you will then have a pretty
correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years ago, I
should have said "my universe:"  but now my mind has been opened to
higher views of things.

In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that
there should be anything of what you call a "solid" kind; but I dare
say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the
Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described
them.  On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least
so as to distinguish one figure from another.  Nothing was visible, nor
could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of
this I will speedily demonstrate.

Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning
over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.

But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your
eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the
inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and
more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye
exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually
a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,
and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.

The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a
Triangle, or a Square, or any other figure cut out from pasteboard.  As
soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will
find that it ceases to appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes
in appearance a straight line.  Take for example an equilateral
Triangle--who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class.
Figure 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were
bending over him from above; figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman,
as you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on
the level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the
table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing
but a straight line.

When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar
experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant
island or coast lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays,
forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a
distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright
upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light
and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.

Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other
acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland.  As there is neither sun
with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none
of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland.  If our friend
comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it
becomes smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a
Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will--a straight
Line he looks and nothing else.

You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantagous circumstances we are
able to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to
this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I
come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.  For the present let me
defer this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses
in our country.




SECTION 2  Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland


As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass
North, South, East, and West.

There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us
to determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our
own.  By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the
South; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight--so that
even a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs
northward without much difficulty--yet the hampering effort of the
southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most
parts of our earth.  Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated
intervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance;
and in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course
have their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so
that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North.  In the country,
where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some sort
of guide.  Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be
expected in determining our bearings.

Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is
hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where
there have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been
occasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting
till the rain came before continuing my journey.  On the weak and aged,
and especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much
more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point
of breeding, if you meet a Lady on the street, always to give her the
North side of the way--by no means an easy thing to do always at short
notice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is
difficult to tell your North from your South.

Windows there are none in our houses:  for the light comes to us alike
in our homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times
and in all places, whence we know not.  It was in old days, with our
learned men, an interesting and oft-investigate question, "What is the
origin of light?" and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted,
with no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the
would-be solvers.  Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such
investigations indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the
Legislature, in comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.
I--alas, I alone in Flatland--know now only too well the true solution
of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge cannot be made
intelligible to a single one of my countrymen; and I am mocked at--I,
the sole possessor of the truths of Space and of the theory of the
introduction of Light from the world of three Dimensions--as if I were
the maddest of the mad!  But a truce to these painful digressions:  let
me return to our homes.

The most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or
pentagonal, as in the annexed figure.  The two Northern sides RO, OF,
constitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the East
is a small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for the
Men; the South side or floor is usually doorless.

Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason.  The
angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,)
being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of
inanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men
and Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of
a square or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an
inconsiderate or perhaps absentminded traveller suddenly running
against them: and therefore, as early as the eleventh century of our
era, triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only
exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other
state buildings, which is not desirable that the general public should
approach without circumspection.

At this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted, though
discouraged by a special tax.  But, about three centuries afterwards,
the Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten
thousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that
could be allowed consistently with the public safety.  The good sense
of the community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now,
even in the country, the pentagonal construction has superseded every
other.  It is only now and then in some very remote and backward
agricultural district that an antiquarian may still discover a square
house.




SECTION 3  Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland


The greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant of Flatland
may be estimated at about eleven of your inches.  Twelve inches may be
regarded as a maximum.

Our Women are Straight Lines.

Our Soldiers and Lowest Class of Workmen are Triangles with two equal
sides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so short
(often not exceeding half an inch) that they form at their vertices a
very sharp and formidable angle.  Indeed when their bases are of the
most degraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size),
they can hardly be distinguished from Straight lines or Women; so
extremely pointed are their vertices.  With us, as with you, these
Triangles are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and
by this name I shall refer to them in the following pages.

Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.

Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself
belong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.

Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,
beginning at Six-Sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in
the number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of
Polygonal, or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes
so numerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot
be distinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or
Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.

It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more
side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule)
one step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a
Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.

But this rule applies not always to the Tradesman, and still less often
to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to
deserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides
equal.  With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the
son of an Isosceles (i.e. a Triangle with two sides equal) remains
Isosceles still.  Nevertheless, all hope is not such out, even from the
Isosceles, that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded
condition.  For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent
and skillful labours, it is generally found that the more intelligent
among the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of
their third side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides.
Intermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons and daughters
of these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally
result in an offspring approximating still more to the type of the
Equal-Sided Triangle.

Rarely--in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births--is a
genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle produced from Isosceles
parents (footnote 1).  Such a birth requires, as its antecedents, not
only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages, but also a
long-continued exercise of frugality and self-control on the part of
the would-be ancestors of the coming Equilateral, and a patient,
systematic, and continuous development of the Isosceles intellect
through many generations.

The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the
subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs round.  After a
strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the
infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted
into the class of Equilaterals.  He is then immediately taken from his
proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral,
who is bound by oath never to permit the child henceforth to enter his
former home or so much as to look upon his relations again, for fear
lest the freshly developed organism may, by force of unconscious
imitation, fall back again into his hereditary level.

The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks of his
serf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by the poor serfs themselves,
as a gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their
existence, but also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher
classes are well aware that these rare phenomena, while they do little
or nothing to vulgarize their own privileges, serve as almost useful
barrier against revolution from below.

Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely
destitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in
some of their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their
superior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the
Circles.  But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that in proportion
as the working-classes increase in intelligence, knowledge, and all
virtue, in that same proportion their acute angle (which makes them
physically terrible) shall increase also and approximate to their
comparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle.  Thus, in the
most brutal and formidable off the soldier class--creatures almost on a
level with women in their lack of intelligence--it is found that, as
they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous
penetrating power to advantage, so do they wane in the power of
penetration itself.

How admirable is the Law of Compensation!  And how perfect a proof of
the natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the
aristocratic constitution of the States of Flatland!  By a judicious
use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always
able to stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the
irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.  Art also
comes to the aid of Law and Order.  It is generally found possible--by
a little artificial compression or expansion on the part of the State
physicians--to make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion
perfectly Regular, and to admit them at once into the privileged
classes; a much larger number, who are still below the standard,
allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled, are induced to
enter the State Hospitals, where they are kept in honourable
confinement for life; one or two alone of the most obstinate, foolish,
and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.

Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless and leaderless, are
either transfixed without resistance by the small body of their
brethren whom the Chief Circle keeps in pay for emergencies of this
kind; or else more often, by means of jealousies and suspicious
skillfully fomented among them by the Circular party, they are stirred
to mutual warfare, and perish by one another's angles.  No less than
one hundred and twenty rebellions are recorded in our annals, besides
minor outbreaks numbered at two hundred and thirty-five; and they have
all ended thus.



Footnote 1.  "What need of a certificate?" a Spaceland critic may ask:
"Is not the procreation of a Square Son a certificate from Nature
herself, proving the Equal-sidedness of the Father?" I reply that no
Lady of any position will mary an uncertified Triangle.  Square
offspring has sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle;
but in almost every such case the Irregularity of the first generation
is visited on the third; which either fails to attain the Pentagonal
rank, or relapses to the Triangular.




SECTION 4  Concerning the Women


If our highly pointed Triangles of the Soldier class are formidable, it
may be readily inferred that far more formidable are our Women.  For,
if a Soldier is a wedge, a Woman is a needle; being, so to speak, ALL
point, at least at the two extremities.  Add to this the power of
making herself practically invisible at will, and you will perceive
that a Female, in Flatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled
with.

But here, perhaps, some of my younger Readers may ask HOW a woman in
Flatland can make herself invisible.  This ought, I think, to be
apparent without any explanation.  However, a few words will make it
clear to the most unreflecting.

Place a needle on the table.  Then, with your eye on the level of the
table, look at it side-ways, and you see the whole length of it; but
look at it end-ways, and you see nothing but a point, it has become
practically invisible.  Just so is it with one of our Women.  When her
side is turned towards us, we see her as a straight line; when the end
containing her eye or mouth--for with us these two organs are
identical--is the part that meets our eye, then we see nothing but a
highly lustrous point; but when the back is presented to our view,
then--being only sub-lustrous, and, indeed, almost as dim as an
inanimate object--her hinder extremity serves her as a kind of
Invisible Cap.

The dangers to which we are exposed from our Women must now be manifest
to the meanest capacity of Spaceland.  If even the angle of a
respectable Triangle in the middle class is not without its dangers; if
to run against a Working Man involves a gash; if collision with an
Officer of the military class necessitates a serious wound; if a mere
touch from the vertex of a Private Soldier brings with it danger of
death;--what can it be to run against a woman, except absolute and
immediate destruction?  And when a Woman is invisible, or visible only
as a dim sub-lustrous point, how difficult must it be, even for the
most cautious, always to avoid collision!

Many are the enactments made at different times in the different States
of Flatland, in order to minimize this peril; and in the Southern and
less temperate climates, where the force of gravitation is greater, and
human beings more liable to casual and involuntary motions, the Laws
concerning Women are naturally much more stringent.  But a general view
of the Code may be obtained from the following summary:--

1.  Every house shall have one entrance on the Eastern side, for the
use of Females only; by which all females shall enter "in a becoming
and respectful manner" (footnote 1) and not by the Men's or Western
door.

2.  No Female shall walk in any public place without continually
keeping up her Peace-cry, under penalty of death.

3.  Any Female, duly certified to be suffering from St. Vitus's Dance,
fits, chronic cold accompanied by violent sneezing, or any disease
necessitating involuntary motions, shall be instantly destroyed.

In some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females,
under penalty of death, from walking or standing in any public place
without moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to
indicate their presence to those behind them; others oblige a Woman,
when travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by
her husband; others confine Women altogether in their houses except
during the religious festivals.  But it has been found by the wisest of
our Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on
Females tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race,
but also to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a
State loses more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.

For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement
at home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their
spleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate
climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes
destroyed in one or two hours of a simultaneous female outbreak.  Hence
the Three Laws, mentioned above, suffice for the better regulated
States, and may be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female
Code.

After all, our principal safeguard is found, not in Legislature, but in
the interests of the Women themselves.  For, although they can inflict
instantaneous death by a retrograde movement, yet unless they can at
once disengage their stinging extremity from the struggling body of
their victim, their own frail bodies are liable to be shattered.

The power of Fashion is also on our side.  I pointed out that in some
less civilized States no female is suffered to stand in any public
place without swaying her back from right to left.  This practice has
been universal among ladies of any pretensions to breeding in all
well-governed States, as far back as the memory of Figures can reach.
It is considered a disgrace to any state that legislation should have
to enforce what ought to be, and is in every respectable female, a
natural instinct.  The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated
undulation of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and
imitated by the wife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing
beyond a mere monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum; and the
regular tick of the Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the
wife of the progressive and aspiring Isosceles, in the females of whose
family no "back-motion" of any kind has become as yet a necessity of
life.  Hence, in every family of position and consideration, "back
motion" is as prevalent as time itself; and the husbands and sons in
these households enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.

Not that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute
of affection.  But unfortunately the passion of the moment
predominates, in the Frail Sex, over every other consideration.  This
is, of course, a necessity arising from their unfortunate conformation.
For as they have no pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this
respect to the very lowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently
wholly devoid of brainpower, and have neither reflection, judgment nor
forethought, and hardly any memory.  Hence, in their fits of fury, they
remember no claims and recognize no distinctions.  I have actually
known a case where a Woman has exterminated her whole household, and
half an hour afterwards, when her rage was over and the fragments swept
away, has asked what has become of her husband and children.

Obviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she is in a
position where she can turn round.  When you have them in their
apartments--which are constructed with a view to denying them that
power--you can say and do what you like; for they are then wholly
impotent for mischief, and will not remember a few minutes hence the
incident for which they may be at this moment threatening you with
death, nor the promises which you may have found it necessary to make
in order to pacify their fury.

On the whole we got on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations,
except in the lower strata of the Military Classes.  There the want of
tact and discretion on the part of the husbands produces at times
indescribable disasters.  Relying too much on the offensive weapons of
their acute angles instead of the defensive organs of good sense and
seasonable simulations, these reckless creatures too often neglect the
prescribed construction of the women's apartments, or irritate their
wives by ill-advised expressions out of doors, which they refuse
immediately to retract.  Moreover a blunt and stolid regard for literal
truth indisposes them to make those lavish promises by which the more
judicious Circle can in a moment pacify his consort.  The result is
massacre; not, however, without its advantages, as it eliminates the
more brutal and troublesome of the Isosceles; and by many of our
Circles the destructiveness of the Thinner Sex is regarded as one among
many providential arrangements for suppressing redundant population,
and nipping Revolution in the bud.

Yet even in our best regulated and most approximately Circular families
I cannot say that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in
Spaceland.  There is peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may
be called by that name, but there is necessarily little harmony of
tastes or pursuits; and the cautious wisdom of the Circles has ensured
safety at the cost of domestic comfort.  In every Circular or Polygonal
household it has been a habit from time immemorial--and now has become
a kind of instinct among the women of our higher classes--that the
mothers and daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths
towards their husband and his male friends; and for a lady in a family
of distinction to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a
kind of portent, involving loss of STATUS.  But, as I shall soon shew,
this custom, though it has the advantage of safety, is not without
disadvantages.

In the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman--where the
wife is allowed to turn her back upon her husband, while pursuing her
household avocations--there are at least intervals of quiet, when the
wife is neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound of the
continuous Peace-cry; but in the homes of the upper classes there is
too often no peace.  There the voluble mouth and bright penetrating eye
are ever directed toward the Master of the household; and light itself
is not more persistent than the stream of Feminine discourse.  The tact
and skill which suffice to avert a Woman's sting are unequal to the
task of stopping a Woman's mouth; and as the wife has absolutely
nothing to say, and absolutely no constraint of wit, sense, or
conscience to prevent her from saying it, not a few cynics have been
found to aver that they prefer the danger of the death-dealing but
inaudible sting to the safe sonorousness of a Woman's other end.

To my readers in Spaceland the condition of our Women may seen truly
deplorable, and so indeed it is.  A Male of the lowest type of the
Isosceles may look forward to some improvement of his angle, and to the
ultimate elevation of the whole of his degraded caste; but no Woman can
entertain such hopes for her sex.  "Once a Woman, always a Woman" is a
Decree of Nature; and the very Laws of Evolution seem suspended in her
disfavour.  Yet at least we can admire the wise Prearrangement which
has ordained that, as they have no hopes, so they shall have no memory
to recall, and no forethought to anticipate, the miseries and
humiliations which are at once a necessity of their existence and the
basis of the constitution of Flatland.




SECTION 5  Of our Methods of Recognizing one another


You, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you, who are gifted
with two eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective, and charmed
with the enjoyment of various colours, you, who can actually SEE an
angle, and contemplate the complete circumference of a Circle in the
happy region of the Three Dimensions--how shall I make it clear to you
the extreme difficulty which we in Flatland experience in recognizing
one another's configuration?

Recall what I told you above.  All beings in Flatland, animate and
inanimate, no matter what their form, present TO OUR VIEW the same, or
nearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line.  How then
can one be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?

The answer is threefold.  The first means of recognition is the sense
of hearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you,
and which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice of our
personal friends, but even to discriminate between different classes,
at least so far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral,
the Square, and the Pentagon--for the Isosceles I take no account.  But
as we ascend the social scale, the process of discriminating and being
discriminated by hearing increases in difficulty, partly because voices
are assimilated, partly because the faculty of voice-discrimination is
a plebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy.  And
wherever there is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this
method.  Amongst our lowest orders, the vocal organs are developed to a
degree more than correspondent with those of hearing, so that an
Isosceles can easily feign the voice of a Polygon, and, with some
training, that of a Circle himself.  A second method is therefore more
commonly resorted to.

FEELING is, among our Women and lower classes--about our upper classes
I shall speak presently--the principal test of recognition, at all
events between strangers, and when the question is, not as to the
individual, but as to the class.  What therefore "introduction" is
among the higher classes in Spaceland, that the process of "feeling" is
with us.  "Permit me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr.
So-and-so"--is still, among the more old-fashioned of our country
gentlemen in districts remote from towns, the customary formula for a
Flatland introduction.  But in the towns, and among men of business,
the words "be felt by" are omitted and the sentence is abbreviated to,
"Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so"; although it is assumed, of
course, that the "feeling" is to be reciprocal.  Among our still more
modern and dashing young gentlemen--who are extremely averse to
superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to the purity of their
native language--the formula is still further curtailed by the use of
"to feel" in a technical sense, meaning, "to
recommend-for-the-purposes-of-feeling-and-being-felt"; and at this
moment the "slang" of polite or fast society in the upper classes
sanctions such a barbarism as "Mr. Smith, permit me to feel Mr. Jones."

Let not my Reader however suppose that "feeling" is with us the tedious
process that it would be with you, or that we find it necessary to feel
right round all the sides of every individual before we determine the
class to which he belongs.  Long practice and training, begun in the
schools and continued in the experience of daily life, enable us to
discriminate at once by the sense of touch, between the angles of an
equal-sided Triangle, Square, and Pentagon; and I need not say that the
brainless vertex of an acute-angled Isosceles is obvious to the dullest
touch.  It is therefore not necessary, as a rule, to do more than feel
a single angle of an individual; and this, once ascertained, tells us
the class of the person whom we are addressing, unless indeed he
belongs to the higher sections of the nobility.  There the difficulty
is much greater.  Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge
has been known to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided Polygon; and
there is hardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University
who could pretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a
twenty-sided and a twenty-four sided member of the Aristocracy.

Those of my readers who recall the extracts I gave above from the
Legislative code concerning Women, will readily perceive that the
process of introduction by contact requires some care and discretion.
Otherwise the angles might inflict on the unwary Feeling irreparable
injury.  It is essential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt
should stand perfectly still.  A start, a fidgety shifting of the
position, yes, even a violent sneeze, has been known before now to
prove fatal to the incautious, and to nip in the bud many a promising
friendship.  Especially is this true among the lower classes of the
Triangles.  With them, the eye is situated so far from their vertex
that they can scarcely take cognizance of what goes on at that
extremity of their frame.  They are, moreover, of a rough coarse
nature, not sensitive to the delicate touch of the highly organized
Polygon.  What wonder then if an involuntary toss of the head has ere
now deprived the State of a valuable life!

I have heard that my excellent Grandfather--one of the least irregular
of his unhappy Isosceles class, who indeed obtained, shortly before his
decease, four out of seven votes from the Sanitary and Social Board for
passing him into the class of the Equal-sided--often deplored, with a
tear in his venerable eye, a miscarriage of this kind, which had
occurred to his great-great-great-Grandfather, a respectable Working
Man with an angle or brain of 59 degrees 30 minutes.  According to his
account, my unfortunately Ancestor, being afflicted with rheumatism,
and in the act of being felt by a Polygon, by one sudden start
accidentally transfixed the Great Man through the diagonal and thereby,
partly in consequence of his long imprisonment and degradation, and
partly because of the moral shock which pervaded the whole of my
Ancestor's relations, threw back our family a degree and a half in
their ascent towards better things.  The result was that in the next
generation the family brain was registered at only 58 degrees, and not
till the lapse of five generations was the lost ground recovered, the
full 60 degrees attained, and the Ascent from the Isosceles finally
achieved.  And all this series of calamities from one little accident
in the process of Feeling.

As this point I think I hear some of my better educated readers
exclaim, "How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and
degrees, or minutes?  We SEE an angle, because we, in the region of
Space, can see two straight lines inclined to one another; but you, who
can see nothing but on straight line at a time, or at all events only a
number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line,--how can you
ever discern an angle, and much less register angles of different
sizes?"

I answer that though we cannot SEE angles, we can INFER them, and this
with great precision.  Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity, and
developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles far more
accurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule or measure
of angles.  Nor must I omit to explain that we have great natural
helps.  It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the Isosceles
class shall begin at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and shall
increase (if it increases at all) by half a degree in every generation
until the goal of 60 degrees is reached, when the condition of serfdom
is quitted, and the freeman enters the class of Regulars.

Consequently, Nature herself supplies us with an ascending scale or
Alphabet of angles for half a degree up to 60 degrees, Specimen of
which are placed in every Elementary School throughout the land.  Owing
to occasional retrogressions, to still more frequent moral and
intellectual stagnation, and to the extraordinary fecundity of the
Criminal and Vagabond classes, there is always a vast superfluity of
individuals of the half degree and single degree class, and a fair
abundance of Specimens up to 10 degrees.  These are absolutely
destitute of civil rights; and a great number of them, not having even
intelligence enough for the purposes of warfare, are devoted by the
States to the service of education.  Fettered immovably so as to remove
all possibility of danger, they are placed in the classrooms of our
Infant Schools, and there they are utilized by the Board of Education
for the purpose of imparting to the offspring of the Middle Classes the
tact and intelligence which these wretched creatures themselves are
utterly devoid.

In some States the Specimens are occasionally fed and suffered to exist
for several years; but in the more temperate and better regulated
regions, it is found in the long run more advantageous for the
educational interests of the young, to dispense with food, and to renew
the Specimens every month--which is about the average duration of the
foodless existence of the Criminal class.  In the cheaper schools, what
is gained by the longer existence of the Specimen is lost, partly in
the expenditure for food, and partly in the diminished accuracy of the
angles, which are impaired after a few weeks of constant "feeling." Nor
must we forget to add, in enumerating the advantages of the more
expensive system, that it tends, though slightly yet perceptibly, to
the diminution of the redundant Isosceles population--an object which
every statesman in Flatland constantly keeps in view.  On the whole
therefore--although I am not ignorant that, in many popularly elected
School Boards, there is a reaction in favour of "the cheap system" as
it is called--I am myself disposed to think that this is one of the
many cases in which expense is the truest economy.

But I must not allow questions of School Board politics to divert me
from my subject.  Enough has been said, I trust, to shew that
Recognition by Feeling is not so tedious or indecisive a process as
might have been supposed; and it is obviously more trustworthy than
Recognition by hearing.  Still there remains, as has been pointed out
above, the objection that this method is not without danger.  For this
reason many in the Middle and Lower classes, and all without exception
in the Polygonal and Circular orders, prefer a third method, the
description of which shall be reserved for the next section.




SECTION 6  Of Recognition by Sight


I am about to appear very inconsistent.  In the previous sections I
have said that all figures in Flatland present the appearance of a
straight line; and it was added or implied, that it is consequently
impossible to distinguish by the visual organ between individuals of
different classes:  yet now I am about to explain to my Spaceland
critics how we are able to recognize one another by the sense of sight.

If however the Reader will take the trouble to refer to the passage in
which Recognition by Feeling is stated to be universal, he will find
this qualification--"among the lower classes." It is only among the
higher classes and in our more temperate climates that Sight
Recognition is practised.

That this power exists in any regions and for any classes is the result
of Fog; which prevails during the greater part of the year in all parts
save the torrid zones.  That which is with you in Spaceland an unmixed
evil, blotting out the landscape, depressing the spirits, and
enfeebling the health, is by us recognized as a blessing scarcely
inferior to air itself, and as the Nurse of arts and Parent of
sciences.  But let me explain my meaning, without further eulogies on
this beneficent Element.

If Fog were non-existent, all lines would appear equally and
indistinguishably clear; and this is actually the case in those unhappy
countries in which the atmosphere is perfectly dry and transparent.
But wherever there is a rich supply of Fog, objects that are at a
distance, say of three feet, are appreciably dimmer than those at the
distance of two feet eleven inches; and the result is that by careful
and constant experimental observation of comparative dimness and
clearness, we are enabled to infer with great exactness the
configuration of the object observed.

An instance will do more than a volume of generalities to make my
meaning clear.

Suppose I see two individuals approaching whose rank I wish to
ascertain.  They are, we will suppose, a Merchant and a Physician, or
in other words, an Equilateral Triangle and a Pentagon; how am I to
distinguish them?

It will be obvious, to every child in Spaceland who has touched the
threshold of Geometrical Studies, that, if I can bring my eye so that
its glance may bisect an angle (A) of the approaching stranger, my view
will lie as it were evenly between the two sides that are next to me
(viz. CA and AB), so that I shall contemplate the two impartially, and
both will appear of the same size.

Now in the case of (1) the Merchant, what shall I see?  I shall see a
straight line DAE, in which the middle point (A) will be very bright
because it is nearest to me; but on either side the line will shade
away RAPIDLY TO DIMNESS, because the sides AC and AB RECEDE RAPIDLY
INTO THE FOG and what appear to me as the Merchant's extremities, viz.
D and E, will be VERY DIM INDEED.

On the other hand in the case of (2) the Physician, though I shall here
also see a line (D'A'E') with a bright centre (A'), yet it will shade
away LESS RAPIDLY to dimness, because the sides (A'C', A'B') RECEDE
LESS RAPIDLY INTO THE FOG:  and what appear to me the Physician's
extremities, viz. D' and E', will not be NOT SO DIM as the extremities
of the Merchant.

The Reader will probably understand from these two instances how--after
a very long training supplemented by constant experience--it is
possible for the well-educated classes among us to discriminate with
fair accuracy between the middle and lowest orders, by the sense of
sight.  If my Spaceland Patrons have grasped this general conception,
so far as to conceive the possibility of it and not to reject my
account as altogether incredible--I shall have attained all I can
reasonably expect.  Were I to attempt further details I should only
perplex.  Yet for the sake of the young and inexperienced, who may
perchance infer--from the two simple instances I have given above, of
the manner in which I should recognize my Father and my Sons--that
Recognition by sight is an easy affair, it may be needful to point out
that in actual life most of the problems of Sight Recognition are far
more subtle and complex.

If for example, when my Father, the Triangle, approaches me, he happens
to present his side to me instead of his angle, then, until I have
asked him to rotate, or until I have edged my eye around him, I am for
the moment doubtful whether he may not be a Straight Line, or, in other
words, a Woman.  Again, when I am in the company of one of my two
hexagonal Grandsons, contemplating one of his sides (AB) full front, it
will be evident from the accompanying diagram that I shall see one
whole line (AB) in comparative brightness (shading off hardly at all at
the ends) and two smaller lines (CA and BD) dim throughout and shading
away into greater dimness towards the extremities C and D.

But I must not give way to the temptation of enlarging on these topics.
The meanest mathematician in Spaceland will readily believe me when I
assert that the problems of life, which present themselves to the
well-educated--when they are themselves in motion, rotating, advancing
or retreating, and at the same time attempting to discriminate by the
sense of sight between a number of Polygons of high rank moving in
different directions, as for example in a ball-room or
conversazione--must be of a nature to task the angularity of the most
intellectual, and amply justify the rich endowments of the Learned
Professors of Geometry, both Static and Kinetic, in the illustrious
University of Wentbridge, where the Science and Art of Sight
Recognition are regularly taught to large classes of the ELITE of the
States.

It is only a few of the scions of our noblest and wealthiest houses,
who are able to give the time and money necessary for the thorough
prosecution of this noble and valuable Art.  Even to me, a
Mathematician of no mean standing, and the Grandfather of two most
hopeful and perfectly regular Hexagons, to find myself in the midst of
a crowd of rotating Polygons of the higher classes, is occasionally
very perplexing.  And of course to a common Tradesman, or Serf, such a
sight is almost as unintelligible as it would be to you, my Reader,
were you suddenly transported to my country.

In such a crowd you could see on all sides of you nothing but a Line,
apparently straight, but of which the parts would vary irregularly and
perpetually in brightness or dimness.  Even if you had completed your
third year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes in the University,
and were perfect in the theory of the subject, you would still find
there was need of many years of experience, before you could move in a
fashionable crowd without jostling against your betters, whom it is
against etiquette to ask to "feel," and who, by their superior culture
and breeding, know all about your movements, while you know very little
or nothing about theirs.  In a word, to comport oneself with perfect
propriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself.
Such at least is the painful teaching of my experience.

It is astonishing how much the Art--or I may almost call it
instinct--of Sight Recognition is developed by the habitual practice of
it and by the avoidance of the custom of "Feeling."  Just as, with you,
the deaf and dumb, if once allowed to gesticulate and to use the
hand-alphabet, will never acquire the more difficult but far more
valuable art of lip-speech and lip-reading, so it is with us as regards
"Seeing" and "Feeling." None who in early life resort to "Feeling" will
ever learn "Seeing" in perfection.

For this reason, among our Higher Classes, "Feeling" is discouraged or
absolutely forbidden.  From the cradle their children, instead of going
to the Public Elementary schools (where the art of Feeling is taught,)
are sent to higher Seminaries of an exclusive character; and at our
illustrious University, to "feel" is regarded as a most serious fault,
involving Rustication for the first offence, and Expulsion for the
second.

But among the lower classes the art of Sight Recognition is regarded as
an unattainable luxury.  A common Tradesman cannot afford to let his
son spend a third of his life in abstract studies.  The children of the
poor are therefore allowed to "feel" from their earliest years, and
they gain thereby a precocity and an early vivacity which contrast at
first most favourably with the inert, undeveloped, and listless
behaviour of the half-instructed youths of the Polygonal class; but
when the latter have at last completed their University course, and are
prepared to put their theory into practice, the change that comes over
them may almost be described as a new birth, and in every art, science,
and social pursuit they rapidly overtake and distance their Triangular
competitors.

Only a few of the Polygonal Class fail to pass the Final Test or
Leaving Examination at the University.  The condition of the
unsuccessful minority is truly pitiable.  Rejected from the higher
class, they are also despised by the lower.  They have neither the
matured and systematically trained powers of the Polygonal Bachelors
and Masters of Arts, nor yet the native precocity and mercurial
versatility of the youthful Tradesman.  The professions, the public
services, are closed against them, and though in most States they are
not actually debarred from marriage, yet they have the greatest
difficulty in forming suitable alliances, as experience shews that the
offspring of such unfortunate and ill-endowed parents is generally
itself unfortunate, if not positively Irregular.

It is from these specimens of the refuse of our Nobility that the great
Tumults and Seditions of past ages have generally derived their
leaders; and so great is the mischief thence arising that an increasing
minority of our more progressive Statesmen are of opinion that true
mercy would dictate their entire suppression, by enacting that all who
fail to pass the Final Examination of the University should be either
imprisoned for life, or extinguished by a painless death.

But I find myself digressing into the subject of Irregularities, a
matter of such vital interest that it demands a separate section.





SECTION 7  Concerning Irregular Figures


Throughout the previous pages I have been assuming--what perhaps should
have been laid down at the beginning as a distinct and fundamental
proposition--that every human being in Flatland is a Regular Figure,
that is to say of regular construction.  By this I mean that a Woman
must not only be a line, but a straight line; that an Artisan or
Soldier must have two of his sides equal; that Tradesmen must have
three sides equal; Lawyers (of which class I am a humble member), four
sides equal, and, generally, that in every Polygon, all the sides must
be equal.

The sizes of the sides would of course depend upon the age of the
individual.  A Female at birth would be about an inch long, while a
tall adult Woman might extend to a foot.  As to the Males of every
class, it may be roughly said that the length of an adult's size, when
added together, is two feet or a little more.  But the size of our
sides is not under consideration.  I am speaking of the EQUALITY of
sides, and it does not need much reflection to see that the whole of
the social life in Flatland rests upon the fundamental fact that Nature
wills all Figures to have their sides equal.

If our sides were unequal our angles might be unequal.  Instead of its
being sufficient to feel, or estimate by sight, a single angle in order
to determine the form of an individual, it would be necessary to
ascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling.  But life would be
too short for such a tedious groping.  The whole science and art of
Sight Recognition would at once perish; Feeling, so far as it is an
art, would not long survive; intercourse would become perilous or
impossible; there would be an end to all confidence, all forethought;
no one would be safe in making the most simple social arrangements; in
a word, civilization might relapse into barbarism.

Am I going too fast to carry my Readers with me to these obvious
conclusions?  Surely a moment's reflection, and a single instance from
common life, must convince every one that our social system is based
upon Regularity, or Equality of Angles.  You meet, for example, two or
three Tradesmen in the street, whom your recognize at once to be
Tradesman by a glance at their angles and rapidly bedimmed sides, and
you ask them to step into your house to lunch.  This you do at present
with perfect confidence, because everyone knows to an inch or two the
area occupied by an adult Triangle: but imagine that your Tradesman
drags behind his regular and respectable vertex, a parallelogram of
twelve or thirteen inches in diagonal:--what are you to do with such a
monster sticking fast in your house door?

But I am insulting the intelligence of my Readers by accumulating
details which must be patent to everyone who enjoys the advantages of a
Residence in Spaceland.  Obviously the measurements of a single angle
would no longer be sufficient under such portentous circumstances;
one's whole life would be taken up in feeling or surveying the
perimeter of one's acquaintances.  Already the difficulties of avoiding
a collision in a crowd are enough to tax the sagacity of even a
well-educated Square; but if no one could calculate the Regularity of a
single figure in the company, all would be chaos and confusion, and the
slightest panic would cause serious injuries, or--if there happened to
be any Women or Soldiers present--perhaps considerable loss of life.

Expediency therefore concurs with Nature in stamping the seal of its
approval upon Regularity of conformation:  nor has the Law been
backward in seconding their efforts.  "Irregularity of Figure" means
with us the same as, or more than, a combination of moral obliquity and
criminality with you, and is treated accordingly.  There are not
wanting, it is true, some promulgators of paradoxes who maintain that
there is no necessary connection between geometrical and moral
Irregularity.  "The Irregular," they say, "is from his birth scouted by
his own parents, derided by his brothers and sisters, neglected by the
domestics, scorned and suspected by society, and excluded from all
posts of responsibility, trust, and useful activity.  His every
movement is jealously watched by the police till he comes of age and
presents himself for inspection; then he is either destroyed, if he is
found to exceed the fixed margin of deviation, at an uninteresting
occupation for a miserable stipend; obliged to live and board at the
office, and to take even his vacation under close supervision; what
wonder that human nature, even in the best and purest, is embittered
and perverted by such surroundings!"

All this very plausible reasoning does not convince me, as it has not
convinced the wisest of our Statesmen, that our ancestors erred in
laying it down as an axiom of policy that the toleration of
Irregularity is incompatible with the safety of the State.  Doubtless,
the life of an Irregular is hard; but the interests of the Greater
Number require that it shall be hard.  If a man with a triangular front
and a polygonal back were allowed to exist and to propagate a still
more Irregular posterity, what would become of the arts of life?  Are
the houses and doors and churches in Flatland to be altered in order to
accommodate such monsters?  Are our ticket-collectors to be required to
measure every man's perimeter before they allow him to enter a theatre,
or to take his place in a lecture room?  Is an Irregular to be exempted
from the militia?  And if not, how is he to be prevented from carrying
desolation into the ranks of his comrades?  Again, what irresistible
temptations to fraudulent impostures must needs beset such a creature!
How easy for him to enter a shop with his polygonal front foremost, and
to order goods to any extent from a confiding tradesman!  Let the
advocates of a falsely called Philanthropy plead as they may for the
abrogation of the Irregular Penal Laws, I for my part have never known
an Irregular who was not also what Nature evidently intended him to
be--a hypocrite, a misanthropist, and, up to the limits of his power, a
perpetrator of all manner of mischief.

Not that I should be disposed to recommend (at present) the extreme
measures adopted by some States, where an infant whose angle deviates
by half a degree from the correct angularity is summarily destroyed at
birth. Some of our highest and ablest men, men of real genius, have
during their earliest days laboured under deviations as great as, or
even greater than forty-five minutes: and the loss of their precious
lives would have been an irreparable injury to the State.  The art of
healing also has achieved some of its most glorious triumphs in the
compressions, extensions, trepannings, colligations, and other surgical
or diaetetic operations by which Irregularity has been partly or wholly
cured.  Advocating therefore a VIA MEDIA, I would lay down no fixed or
absolute line of demarcation; but at the period when the frame is just
beginning to set, and when the Medical Board has reported that recovery
is improbably, I would suggest that the Irregular offspring be
painlessly and mercifully consumed.




SECTION 8  Of the Ancient Practice of Painting


If my Readers have followed me with any attention up to this point,
they will not be surprised to hear that life is somewhat dull in
Flatland.  I do not, of course, mean that there are not battles,
conspiracies, tumults, factions, and all those other phenomena which
are supposed to make History interesting; nor would I deny that the
strange mixture of the problems of life and the problems of
Mathematics, continually inducing conjecture and giving an opportunity
of immediate verification, imparts to our existence a zest which you in
Spaceland can hardly comprehend.  I speak now from the aesthetic and
artistic point of view when I say that life with us is dull;
aesthetically and artistically, very dull indeed.

How can it be otherwise, when all one's prospect, all one's landscapes,
historical pieces, portraits, flowers, still life, are nothing but a
single line, with no varieties except degrees of brightness and
obscurity?

It was not always thus.  Colour, if Tradition speaks the truth, once
for the space of half a dozen centuries or more, threw a transient
splendour over the lives of our ancestors in the remotest ages.  Some
private individual--a Pentagon whose name is variously reported--having
casually discovered the constituents of the simpler colours and a
rudimentary method of painting, is said to have begun by decorating
first his house, then his slaves, then his Father, his Sons, and
Grandsons, lastly himself.  The convenience as well as the beauty of
the results commended themselves to all.  Wherever Chromatistes,--for
by that name the most trustworthy authorities concur in calling
him,--turned his variegated frame, there he at once excited attention,
and attracted respect.  No one now needed to "feel" him; no one mistook
his front for his back; all his movements were readily ascertained by
his neighbours without the slightest strain on their powers of
calculation; no one jostled him, or failed to make way for him; his
voice was saved the labour of that exhausting utterance by which we
colourless Squares and Pentagons are often forced to proclaim our
individuality when we move amid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles.

The fashion spread like wildfire.  Before a week was over, every Square
and Triangle in the district had copied the example of Chromatistes,
and only a few of the more conservative Pentagons still held out.  A
month or two found even the Dodecagons infected with the innovation.  A
year had not elapsed before the habit had spread to all but the very
highest of the Nobility.  Needless to say, the custom soon made its way
from the district of Chromatistes to surrounding regions; and within
two generations no one in all Flatland was colourless except the Women
and the Priests.

Here Nature herself appeared to erect a barrier, and to plead against
extending the innovations to these two classes.  Many-sidedness was
almost essential as a pretext for the Innovators.  "Distinction of
sides is intended by Nature to imply distinction of colours"--such was
the sophism which in those days flew from mouth to mouth, converting
whole towns at a time to a new culture.  But manifestly to our Priests
and Women this adage did not apply.  The latter had only one side, and
therefore--plurally and pedantically speaking--NO SIDES.  The
former--if at least they would assert their claim to be readily and
truly Circles, and not mere high-class Polygons, with an infinitely
large number of infinitesimally small sides--were in the habit of
boasting (what Women confessed and deplored) that they also had no
sides, being blessed with a perimeter of only one line, or, in other
words, a Circumference.  Hence it came to pass that these two Classes
could see no force in the so-called axiom about "Distinction of Sides
implying Distinction of Colour;" and when all others had succumbed to
the fascinations of corporal decoration, the Priests and the Women
alone still remained pure from the pollution of paint.

Immoral, licentious, anarchical, unscientific--call them by what names
you will--yet, from an aesthetic point of view, those ancient days of
the Colour Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland--a
childhood, alas, that never ripened into manhood, nor even reached the
blossom of youth.  To live then in itself a delight, because living
implied seeing.  Even at a small party, the company was a pleasure to
behold; the richly varied hues of the assembly in a church or theatre
are said to have more than once proved too distracting from our
greatest teachers and actors; but most ravishing of all is said to have
been the unspeakable magnificence of a military review.

The sight of a line of battle of twenty thousand Isosceles suddenly
facing about, and exchanging the sombre black of their bases for the
orange of the two sides including their acute angle; the militia of the
Equilateral Triangles tricoloured in red, white, and blue; the mauve,
ultra-marine, gamboge, and burnt umber of the Square artillerymen
rapidly rotating near their vermillion guns; the dashing and flashing
of the five-coloured and six-coloured Pentagons and Hexagons careering
across the field in their offices of surgeons, geometricians and
aides-de-camp--all these may well have been sufficient to render
credible the famous story how an illustrious Circle, overcome by the
artistic beauty of the forces under his command, threw aside his
marshal's baton and his royal crown, exclaiming that he henceforth
exchanged them for the artist's pencil.  How great and glorious the
sensuous development of these days must have been is in part indicated
by the very language and vocabulary of the period.  The commonest
utterances of the commonest citizens in the time of the Colour Revolt
seem to have been suffused with a richer tinge of word or thought; and
to that era we are even now indebted for our finest poetry and for
whatever rhythm still remains in the more scientific utterance of those
modern days.




SECTION 9  Of the Universal Colour Bill


But meanwhile the intellectual Arts were fast decaying.

The Art of Sight Recognition, being no longer needed, was no longer
practised; and the studies of Geometry, Statics, Kinetics, and other
kindred subjects, came soon to be considered superfluous, and fell into
disrespect and neglect even at our University.  The inferior Art of
Feeling speedily experienced the same fate at our Elementary Schools.
Then the Isosceles classes, asserting that the Specimens were no longer
used nor needed, and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the
Criminal classes to the service of Education, waxed daily more numerous
and more insolent on the strength of their immunity from the old burden
which had formerly exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once
taming their brutal nature and thinning their excessive numbers.

Year by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently to
assert--and with increasing truth--that there was no great difference
between them and the very highest class of Polygons, now that they were
raised to an equality with the latter, and enabled to grapple with all
the difficulties and solve all the problems of life, whether Statical
or Kinetical, by the simple process of Colour Recognition.  Not content
with the natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling, they
began boldly to demand the legal prohibition of all "monopolizing and
aristocratic Arts" and the consequent abolition of all endowments for
the studies of Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling.  Soon, they
began to insist that inasmuch as Colour, which was a second Nature, had
destroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions, the Law should follow
in the same path, and that henceforth all individuals and all classes
should be recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights.

Finding the higher Orders wavering and undecided, the leaders of the
Revolution advanced still further in their requirements, and at last
demanded that all classes alike, the Priests and the Women not
excepted, should do homage to Colour by submitting to be painted.  When
it was objected that Priests and Women had no sides, they retorted that
Nature and Expediency concurred in dictating that the front half of
every human being (that is to say, the half containing his eye and
mouth) should be distinguishable from his hinder half.  They therefore
brought before a general and extraordinary Assembly of all the States
of Flatland a Bill proposing that in every Woman the half containing
the eye and mouth should be coloured red, and the other half green.
The Priests were to be painted in the same way, red being applied to
that semicircle in which the eye and mouth formed the middle point;
while the other or hinder semicircle was to be coloured green.

There was no little cunning in this proposal, which indeed emanated not
from any Isosceles--for no being so degraded would have angularity
enough to appreciate, much less to devise, such a model of
state-craft--but from an Irregular Circle who, instead of being
destroyed in his childhood, was reserved by a foolish indulgence to
bring desolation on his country and destruction on myriads of followers.

On the one hand the proposition was calculated to bring the Women in
all classes over to the side of the Chromatic Innovation.  For by
assigning to the Women the same two colours as were assigned to the
Priests, the Revolutionists thereby ensured that, in certain positions,
every Woman would appear as a Priest, and be treated with corresponding
respect and deference--a prospect that could not fail to attract the
Female Sex in a mass.

But by some of my Readers the possibility of the identical appearance
of Priests and Women, under a new Legislation, may not be recognized;
if so, a word or two will make it obvious.

Imagine a woman duly decorated, according to the new Code; with the
front half (i.e., the half containing the eye and mouth) red, and with
the hinder half green.  Look at her from one side.  Obviously you will
see a straight line, HALF RED, HALF GREEN.

Now imagine a Priest, whose mouth is at M, and whose front semicircle
(AMB) is consequently coloured red, while his hinder semicircle is
green; so that the diameter AB divides the green from the red.  If you
contemplate the Great Man so as to have your eye in the same straight
line as his dividing diameter (AB), what you will see will be a
straight line (CBD), of which ONE HALF (CB) WILL BE RED, AND THE OTHER
(BD) GREEN.  The whole line (CD) will be rather shorter perhaps than
that of a full-sized Woman, and will shade off more rapidly towards its
extremities; but the identity of the colours would give you an
immediate impression of identity in Class, making you neglectful of
other details.  Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which
threatened society at the time of the Colour revolt; add too the
certainty that Woman would speedily learn to shade off their
extremities so as to imitate the Circles; it must then be surely
obvious to you, my dear Reader, that the Colour Bill placed us under a
great danger of confounding a Priest with a young Woman.

How attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex may
readily be imagined.  They anticipated with delight the confusion that
would ensue.  At home they might hear political and ecclesiastical
secrets intended not for them but for their husbands and brothers, and
might even issue some commands in the name of a priestly Circle; out of
doors the striking combination of red and green without addition of any
other colours, would be sure to lead the common people into endless
mistakes, and the Woman would gain whatever the Circles lost, in the
deference of the passers by.  As for the scandal that would befall the
Circular Class if the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the Women were
imputed to them, and as to the consequent subversion of the
Constitution, the Female Sex could not be expected to give a thought to
these considerations.  Even in the households of the Circles, the Women
were all in favour of the Universal Colour Bill.

The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization
of the Circles themselves.  In the general intellectual decay they
still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding.
From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular
households with the total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone preserved
the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition, with all the advantages that
result from that admirable training of the intellect.  Hence, up to the
date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the Circles had
not only held their own, but even increased their lead of the other
classes by abstinence from the popular fashion.

Now therefore the artful Irregular whom I described above as the real
author of this diabolical Bill, determined at one blow to lower the
status of the Hierarchy by forcing them to submit to the pollution of
Colour, and at the same time to destroy their domestic opportunities of
training in the Art of Sight Recognition, so as to enfeeble their
intellects by depriving them of their pure and colourless homes.  Once
subjected to the chromatic taint, every parental and every childish
Circle would demoralize each other.  Only in discerning between the
Father and the Mother would the Circular infant find problems for the
exercise of his understanding--problems too often likely to be
corrupted by maternal impostures with the result of shaking the child's
faith in all logical conclusions.  Thus by degrees the intellectual
lustre of the Priestly Order would wane, and the road would then lie
open for a total destruction of all Aristocratic Legislature and for
the subversion of our Privileged Classes.




SECTION 10  Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition


The agitation for the Universal Colour Bill continued for three years;
and up to the last moment of that period it seemed as though Anarchy
were destined to triumph.

A whole army of Polygons, who turned out to fight as private soldiers,
was utterly annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles Triangles--the
Squares and Pentagons meanwhile remaining neutral.

Worse than all, some of the ablest Circles fell a prey to conjugal
fury.  Infuriated by political animosity, the wives in many a noble
household wearied their lords with prayers to give up their opposition
to the Colour Bill; and some, finding their entreaties fruitless, fell
on and slaughtered their innocent children and husband, perishing
themselves in the act of carnage.  It is recorded that during that
triennial agitation no less than twenty-three Circles perished in
domestic discord.

Great indeed was the peril.  It seemed as though the Priests had no
choice between submission and extermination; when suddenly the course
of events was completely changed by one of those picturesque incidents
which Statesmen ought never to neglect, often to anticipate, and
sometimes perhaps to originate, because of the absurdly
disproportionate power with which they appeal to the sympathies of the
populace.

It happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little if at
all above four degrees--accidentally dabbling in the colours of some
Tradesman whose shop he had plundered--painted himself, or caused
himself to be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve colours of
a Dodecagon.  Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned
voice a maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon, whose affection
in former days he had sought in vain; and by a series of
deceptions--aided, on the one side, by a string of lucky accidents too
long to relate, and, on the other, by an almost inconceivable fatuity
and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the relations of the
bride--he succeeded in consummating the marriage.  The unhappy girl
committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which she had been
subjected.

When the news of this catastrophe spread from State to State the minds
of the Women were violently agitated.  Sympathy with the miserable
victim and anticipations of similar deceptions for themselves, their
sisters, and their daughters, made them now regard the Colour Bill in
an entirely new aspect.  Not a few openly avowed themselves converted
to antagonism; the rest needed only a slight stimulus to make a similar
avowal.  Seizing this favourable opportunity, the Circles hastily
convened an extraordinary Assembly of the States; and besides the usual
guard of Convicts, they secured the attendance of a large number of
reactionary Women.

Amidst an unprecedented concourse, the Chief Circle of those days--by
name Pantocyclus--arose to find himself hissed and hooted by a hundred
and twenty thousand Isosceles.  But he secured silence by declaring
that henceforth the Circles would enter on a policy of Concession;
yielding to the wishes of the majority, they would accept the Colour
Bill.  The uproar being at once converted to applause, he invited
Chromatistes, the leader of the Sedition, into the centre of the hall,
to receive in the name of his followers the submission of the
Hierarchy.  Then followed a speech, a masterpiece of rhetoric, which
occupied nearly a day in the delivery, and to which no summary can do
justice.

With a grave appearance of impartiality he declared that as they were
now finally committing themselves to Reform or Innovation, it was
desirable that they should take one last view of the perimeter of the
whole subject, its defects as well as its advantages.  Gradually
introduction the mention of the dangers to the Tradesmen, the
Professional Classes and the Gentlemen, he silenced the rising murmurs
of the Isosceles by reminding them that, in spite of all these defects,
he was willing to accept the Bill if it was approved by the majority.
But it was manifest that all, except the Isosceles, were moved by his
words and were either neutral or averse to the Bill.

Turning now to the Workmen he asserted that their interests must not be
neglected, and that, if they intended to accept the Colour Bill, they
ought at least to do so with full view of the consequences.  Many of
them, he said, were on the point of being admitted to the class of the
Regular Triangles; others anticipated for their children a distinction
they could not hope for themselves.  That honourable ambition would not
have to be sacrificed.  With the universal adoption of Colour, all
distinctions would cease; Regularity would be confused with
Irregularity; development would give place to retrogression; the
Workman would in a few generations be degraded to the level of the
Military, or even the Convict Class; political power would be in the
hands of the greatest number, that is to say the Criminal Classes, who
were already more numerous than the Workmen, and would soon out-number
all the other Classes put together when the usual Compensative Laws of
Nature were violated.

A subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans, and
Chromatistes, in alarm, attempted to step forward and address them.
But he found himself encompassed with guards and forced to remain
silent while the Chief Circle in a few impassioned words made a final
appeal to the Women, exclaiming that, if the Colour Bill passed, no
marriage would henceforth be safe, no woman's honour secure; fraud,
deception, hypocrisy would pervade every household; domestic bliss
would share the fate of the Constitution and pass to speedy perdition.
"Sooner than this," he cried, "come death."

At these words, which were the preconcerted signal for action, the
Isosceles Convicts fell on and transfixed the wretched Chromatistes;
the Regular Classes, opening their ranks, made way for a band of Women
who, under direction of the Circles, moved back foremost, invisibly and
unerringly upon the unconscious soldiers; the Artisans, imitating the
example of their betters, also opened their ranks.  Meantime bands of
Convicts occupied every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx.

The battle, or rather carnage, was of short duration.  Under the
skillful generalship of the Circles almost every Woman's charge was
fatal and very many extracted their sting uninjured, ready for a second
slaughter.  But no second blow was needed; the rabble of the Isosceles
did the rest of the business for themselves.  Surprised, leader-less,
attacked in front by invisible foes, and finding egress cut off by the
Convicts behind them, they at once--after their manner--lost all
presence of mind, and raised the cry of "treachery."  This sealed their
fate.  Every Isosceles now saw and felt a foe in every other.  In half
an hour not one of that vast multitude was living; and the fragments of
seven score thousand of the Criminal Class slain by one another's
angles attested the triumph of Order.

The Circles delayed not to push their victory to the uttermost.  The
Working Men they spared but decimated.  The Militia of the Equilaterals
was at once called out, and every Triangle suspected of Irregularity on
reasonable grounds, was destroyed by Court Martial, without the
formality of exact measurement by the Social Board.  The homes of the
Military and Artisan classes were inspected in a course of visitation
extending through upwards of a year; and during that period every town,
village, and hamlet was systematically purged of that excess of the
lower orders which had been brought about by the neglect to pay the
tribute of Criminals to the Schools and University, and by the
violation of other natural Laws of the Constitution of Flatland.  Thus
the balance of classes was again restored.

Needless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished, and
its possession prohibited.  Even the utterance of any word denoting
Colour, except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was
punished by a severe penalty.  Only at our University in some of the
very highest and most esoteric classes--which I myself have never been
privileged to attend--it is understood that the sparing use of Colour
is still sanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper
problems of mathematics.  But of this I can only speak from hearsay.

Elsewhere in Flatland, Colour is now non-existent.  The art of making
it is known to only one living person, the Chief Circle for the time
being; and by him it is handed down on his death-bed to none but his
Successor.  One manufactory alone produces it; and, lest the secret
should be betrayed, the Workmen are annually consumed, and fresh ones
introduced.  So great is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy
looks back to the far-distant days of the agitation for the Universal
Colour Bill.




SECTION 11  Concerning our Priests


It is high time that I should pass from these brief and discursive
notes about things in Flatland to the central event of this book, my
initiation into the mysteries of Space.  THAT is my subject; all that
has gone before is merely preface.

For this reason I must omit many matters of which the explanation would
not, I flatter myself, be without interest for my Readers: as for
example, our method of propelling and stopping ourselves, although
destitute of feet; the means by which we give fixity to structures of
wood, stone, or brick, although of course we have no hands, nor can we
lay foundations as you can, nor avail ourselves of the lateral pressure
of the earth; the manner in which the rain originates in the intervals
between our various zones, so that the northern regions do not
intercept the moisture falling on the southern; the nature of our hills
and mines, our trees and vegetables, our seasons and harvests; our
Alphabet and method of writing, adapted to our linear tablets; these
and a hundred other details of our physical existence I must pass over,
nor do I mention them now except to indicate to my readers that their
omission proceeds not from forgetfulness on the part of the author, but
from his regard for the time of the Reader.

Yet before I proceed to my legitimate subject some few final remarks
will no doubt be expected by my Readers upon these pillars and
mainstays of the Constitution of Flatland, the controllers of our
conduct and shapers of our destiny, the objects of universal homage and
almost of adoration:  need I say that I mean our Circles or Priests?

When I call them Priests, let me not be understood as meaning no more
than the term denotes with you.  With us, our Priests are
Administrators of all Business, Art, and Science; Directors of Trade,
Commerce, Generalship, Architecture, Engineering, Education,
Statesmanship, Legislature, Morality, Theology; doing nothing
themselves, they are the Causes of everything worth doing, that is done
by others.

Although popularly everyone called a Circle is deemed a Circle, yet
among the better educated Classes it is known that no Circle is really
a Circle, but only a Polygon with a very large number of very small
sides.  As the number of the sides increases, a Polygon approximates to
a Circle; and, when the number is very great indeed, say for example
three or four hundred, it is extremely difficult for the most delicate
touch to feel any polygonal angles.  Let me say rather it WOULD be
difficult:  for, as I have shown above, Recognition by Feeling is
unknown among the highest society, and to FEEL a Circle would be
considered a most audacious insult.  This habit of abstention from
Feeling in the best society enables a Circle the more easily to sustain
the veil of mystery in which, from his earliest years, he is wont to
enwrap the exact nature of his Perimeter or Circumference.  Three feet
being the average Perimeter it follows that, in a Polygon of three
hundred sides each side will be no more than the hundredth part of a
foot in length, or little more than the tenth part of an inch; and in a
Polygon of six or seven hundred sides the sides are little larger than
the diameter of a Spaceland pin-head.  It is always assumed, by
courtesy, that the Chief Circle for the time being has ten thousand
sides.

The ascent of the posterity of the Circles in the social scale is not
restricted, as it is among the lower Regular classes, by the Law of
Nature which limits the increase of sides to one in each generation.
If it were so, the number of sides in the Circle would be a mere
question of pedigree and arithmetic, and the four hundred and
ninety-seventh descendant of an Equilateral Triangle would necessarily
be a polygon with five hundred sides.  But this is not the case.
Nature's Law prescribes two antagonistic decrees affecting Circular
propagation; first, that as the race climbs higher in the scale of
development, so development shall proceed at an accelerated pace;
second, that in the same proportion, the race shall become less
fertile.  Consequently in the home of a Polygon of four or five hundred
sides it is rare to find a son; more than one is never seen.  On the
other hand the son of a five-hundred-sided Polygon has been known to
possess five hundred and fifty, or even six hundred sides.

Art also steps in to help the process of higher Evolution.  Our
physicians have discovered that the small and tender sides of an infant
Polygon of the higher class can be fractured, and his whole frame
re-set, with such exactness that a Polygon of two or three hundred
sides sometimes--by no means always, for the process is attended with
serious risk--but sometimes overleaps two or three hundred generations,
and as it were double at a stroke, the number of his progenitors and
the nobility of his descent.

Many a promising child is sacrificed in this way.  Scarcely one out of
ten survives.  Yet so strong is the parental ambition among those
Polygons who are, as it were, on the fringe of the Circular class, that
it is very rare to find the Nobleman of that position in society, who
has neglected to place his first-born in the Circular Neo-Therapeutic
Gymnasium before he has attained the age of a month.

One year determines success or failure.  At the end of that time the
child has, in all probability, added one more to the tombstones that
crowd the Neo-Therapeutic Cemetery; but on rare occasional a glad
procession bears back the little one to his exultant parents, no longer
a Polygon, but a Circle, at least by courtesy:  and a single instance
of so blessed a result induces multitudes of Polygonal parents to
submit to similar domestic sacrifice, which have a dissimilar issue.




SECTION 12  Of the Doctrine of our Priests


As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a
single maxim, "Attend to your Configuration."  Whether political,
ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its object the
improvement of individual and collective Configuration--with special
reference of course to the Configuration of the Circles, to which all
other objects are subordinated.

It is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually suppressed
those ancient heresies which led men to waste energy and sympathy in
the vain belief that conduct depends upon will, effort, training,
encouragement, praise, or anything else but Configuration.  It was
Pantocyclus--the illustrious Circle mentioned above, as the queller of
the Colour Revolt--who first convinced mankind that Configuration makes
the man; that if, for example, you are born an Isosceles with two
uneven sides, you will assuredly go wrong unless you have them made
even--for which purpose you must go to the Isosceles Hospital;
similarly, if you are a Triangle, or Square, or even a Polygon, born
with any Irregularity, you must be taken to one of the Regular
Hospitals to have your disease cured; otherwise you will end your days
in the State Prison or by the angle of the State Executioner.

All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most
flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect
Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not congenital) by
some collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise, or by taking
too much of it; or even by a sudden change of temperature, resulting in
a shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame.
Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct
nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either
praise or blame.  For why should you praise, for example, the integrity
of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client, when
you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his right
angles?  Or again, why blame a lying, thievish Isosceles, when you
ought rather to deplore the incurable inequality of his sides?

Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical
drawbacks.  In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he
cannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for that
very reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours,
you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed--and
there's an end of the matter.  But in little domestic difficulties,
when the penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question, this
theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must
confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads
as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden change of temperature
has been too much for his Perimeter, and that I ought to lay the blame
not on him but on his Configuration, which can only be strengthened by
abundance of the choicest sweetmeats, I neither see my way logically to
reject, nor practically to accept, his conclusions.

For my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding or
castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my
Grandson's Configuration; though I own that I have no grounds for
thinking so.  At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating
myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles,
sitting as Judges in law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular
and Irregular Figures; and in their homes I know by experience that,
when scolding their children, they speak about "right" and "wrong" as
vehemently and passionately as if they believe that these names
represented real existence, and that a human Figure is really capable
of choosing between them.

Constantly carrying out their policy of making Configuration the
leading idea in every mind, the Circles reverse the nature of that
Commandment which in Spaceland regulates the relations between parents
and children.  With you, children are taught to honour their parents;
with us--next to the Circles, who are the chief object of universal
homage--a man is taught to honour his Grandson, if he has one; or, if
not, his Son.  By "honour," however, is by no means mean "indulgence,"
but a reverent regard for their highest interests:  and the Circles
teach that the duty of fathers is to subordinate their own interests to
those of posterity, thereby advancing the welfare of the whole State as
well as that of their own immediate descendants.

The weak point in the system of the Circles--if a humble Square may
venture to speak of anything Circular as containing any element of
weakness--appears to me to be found in their relations with Women.

As it is of the utmost importance for Society that Irregular births
should be discouraged, it follows that no Woman who has any
Irregularities in her ancestry is a fit partner for one who desires
that his posterity should rise by regular degrees in the social scale.

Now the Irregularity of a Male is a matter of measurement; but as all
Women are straight, and therefore visibly Regular so to speak, one has
to devise some other means of ascertaining what I may call their
invisible Irregularity, that is to say their potential Irregularities
as regards possible offspring.  This is effected by carefully-kept
pedigrees, which are preserved and supervised by the State; and without
a certified pedigree no Woman is allowed to marry.

Now it might have been supposed the a Circle--proud of his ancestry and
regardful for a posterity which might possibly issue hereafter in a
Chief Circle--would be more careful than any other to choose a wife who
had no blot on her escutcheon.  But it is not so.  The care in choosing
a Regular wife appears to diminish as one rises in the social scale.
Nothing would induce an aspiring Isosceles, who has hopes of generating
an Equilateral Son, to take a wife who reckoned a single Irregularity
among her Ancestors; a Square or Pentagon, who is confident that his
family is steadily on the rise, does not inquire above the
five-hundredth generation; a Hexagon or Dodecagon is even more careless
of the wife's pedigree; but a Circle has been known deliberately to
take a wife who has had an Irregular Great-Grandfather, and all because
of some slight superiority of lustre, or because of the charms of a low
voice--which, with us, even more than with you, is thought "an
excellent thing in a Woman."

Such ill-judged marriages are, as might be expected, barren, if they do
not result in positive Irregularity or in diminution of sides; but none
of these evils have hitherto provided sufficiently deterrent.  The loss
of a few sides in a highly-developed Polygon is not easily noticed, and
is sometimes compensated by a successful operation in the
Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium, as I have described above; and the Circles
are too much disposed to acquiesce in infecundity as a law of the
superior development.  Yet, if this evil be not arrested, the gradual
diminution of the Circular class may soon become more rapid, and the
time may not be far distant when, the race being no longer able to
produce a Chief Circle, the Constitution of Flatland must fall.

One other word of warning suggest itself to me, though I cannot so
easily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations with
Women.  About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the Chief
Circle that, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in
Emotion, they ought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive
any mental education.  The consequence was that they were no longer
taught to read, nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to
count the angles of their husband or children; and hence they sensibly
declined during each generation in intellectual power.  And this system
of female non-education or quietism still prevails.

My fear is that, with the best intentions, this policy has been carried
so far as to react injuriously on the Male Sex.

For the consequence is that, as things now are, we Males have to lead a
kind of bi-lingual, and I may almost say bimental, existence.  With
Women, we speak of "love," "duty," "right," "wrong," "pity," "hope,"
and other irrational and emotional conceptions, which have no
existence, and the fiction of which has no object except to control
feminine exuberances; but among ourselves, and in our books, we have an
entirely different vocabulary and I may also say, idiom.  "Love" them
becomes "the anticipation of benefits"; "duty" becomes "necessity" or
"fitness"; and other words are correspondingly transmuted.  Moreover,
among Women, we use language implying the utmost deference for their
Sex; and they fully believe that the Chief Circle Himself is not more
devoutly adored by us than they are:  but behind their backs they are
both regarded and spoken of--by all but the very young--as being little
better than "mindless organisms."

Our Theology also in the Women's chambers is entirely different from
our Theology elsewhere.

Now my humble fear is that this double training, in language as well as
in thought, imposes somewhat too heavy a burden upon the young,
especially when, at the age of three years old, they are taken from the
maternal care and taught to unlearn the old language--except for the
purpose of repeating it in the presence of the Mothers and Nurses--and
to learn the vocabulary and idiom of science.  Already methinks I
discern a weakness in the grasp of mathematical truth at the present
time as compared with the more robust intellect of our ancestors three
hundred years ago.  I say nothing of the possible danger if a Woman
should ever surreptitiously learn to read and convey to her Sex the
result of her perusal of a single popular volume; nor of the
possibility that the indiscretion or disobedience of some infant Male
might reveal to a Mother the secrets of the logical dialect.  On the
simple ground of the enfeebling of the male intellect, I rest this
humble appeal to the highest Authorities to reconsider the regulations
of Female education.




PART II


OTHER WORLDS


"O brave new worlds, That have such people in them!"




SECTION 13  How I had a Vision of Lineland


It was the last day but one of the 1999th year of our era, and the
first day of the Long Vacation.  Having amused myself till a late hour
with my favourite recreation of Geometry, I had retired to rest with an
unsolved problem in my mind.  In the night I had a dream.

I saw before me a vast multitude of small Straight Lines (which I
naturally assumed to be Women) interspersed with other Beings still
smaller and of the nature of lustrous points--all moving to and fro in
one and the same Straight Line, and, as nearly as I could judge, with
the same velocity.

A noise of confused, multitudinous chirping or twittering issued from
them at intervals as long as they were moving; but sometimes they
ceased from motion, and then all was silence.

Approaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women, I
accosted her, but received no answer.  A second and third appeal on my
part were equally ineffectual.  Losing patience at what appeared to me
intolerable rudeness, I brought my mouth to a position full in front of
her mouth so as to intercept her motion, and loudly repeated my
question, "Woman, what signifies this concourse, and this strange and
confused chirping, and this monotonous motion to and fro in one and the
same Straight Line?"

"I am no Woman," replied the small Line:  "I am the Monarch of the
world.  But thou, whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland?"
Receiving this abrupt reply, I begged pardon if I had in any way
startled or molested his Royal Highness; and describing myself as a
stranger I besought the King to give me some account of his dominions.
But I had the greatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information
on points that really interested me; for the Monarch could not refrain
from constantly assuming that whatever was familiar to him must also be
known to me and that I was simulating ignorance in jest.  However, by
preserving questions I elicited the following facts:

It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch--as he called himself--was
persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in
which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and
indeed the whole of Space.  Not being able either to move or to see,
save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it.
Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had
come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made
no answer, "seeing no man," as he expressed it, "and hearing a voice as
it were from my own intestines."  Until the moment when I placed my
mouth in his World, he had neither seen me, nor heard anything except
confused sounds beating against, what I called his side, but what he
called his INSIDE or STOMACH; nor had he even now the least conception
of the region from which I had come.  Outside his World, or Line, all
was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space;
say, rather, all was non-existent.

His subjects--of whom the small Lines were men and the Points
Women--were all alike confined in motion and eyesight to that single
Straight Line, which was their World.  It need scarcely be added that
the whole of their horizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one
ever see anything but a Point.  Man, woman, child, thing--each as a
Point to the eye of a Linelander.  Only by the sound of the voice could
sex or age be distinguished.  Moreover, as each individual occupied the
whole of the narrow path, so to speak, which constituted his Universe,
and no one could move to the right or left to make way for passers by,
it followed that no Linelander could ever pass another.  Once
neighbours, always neighbours.  Neighbourhood with them was like
marriage with us.  Neighbours remained neighbours till death did them
part.

Such a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion to a
Straight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was surprised
to note that vivacity and cheerfulness of the King.  Wondering whether
it was possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to domestic
relations, to enjoy the pleasures of conjugal union, I hesitated for
some time to question his Royal Highness on so delicate a subject; but
at last I plunged into it by abruptly inquiring as to the health of his
family.  "My wives and children," he replied, "are well and happy."

Staggered at this answer--for in the immediate proximity of the Monarch
(as I had noted in my dream before I entered Lineland) there were none
but Men--I ventured to reply, "Pardon me, but I cannot imagine how your
Royal Highness can at any time either see or approach their Majesties,
when there at least half a dozen intervening individuals, whom you can
neither see through, nor pass by?  Is it possible that in Lineland
proximity is not necessary for marriage and for the generation of
children?"

"How can you ask so absurd a question?" replied the Monarch.  "If it
were indeed as you suggest, the Universe would soon be depopulated.
No, no; neighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the
birth of children is too important a matter to have been allowed to
depend upon such an accident as proximity.  You cannot be ignorant of
this.  Yet since you are pleased to affect ignorance, I will instruct
you as if you were the veriest baby in Lineland.  Know, then, that
marriages are consummated by means of the faculty of sound and the
sense of hearing.

"You are of course aware that every Man has two mouths or voices--as
well as two eyes--a bass at one and a tenor at the other of his
extremities.  I should not mention this, but that I have been unable to
distinguish your tenor in the course of our conversation." I replied
that I had but one voice, and that I had not been aware that his Royal
Highness had two.  "That confirms my impression," said the King, "that
you are not a Man, but a feminine Monstrosity with a bass voice, and an
utterly uneducated ear.  But to continue.

"Nature having herself ordained that every Man should wed two wives--"
"Why two?" asked I.  "You carry your affected simplicity too far," he
cried.  "How can there be a completely harmonious union without the
combination of the Four in One, viz. the Bass and Tenor of the Man and
the Soprano and Contralto of the two Women?"  "But supposing," said I,
"that a man should prefer one wife or three?"  "It is impossible," he
said; "it is as inconceivable as that two and one should make five, or
that the human eye should see a Straight Line."  I would have
interrupted him; but he proceeded as follows:

"Once in the middle of each week a Law of Nature compels us to move to
and fro with a rhythmic motion of more than usual violence, which
continues for the time you would take to count a hundred and one.  In
the midst of this choral dance, at the fifty-first pulsation, the
inhabitants of the Universe pause in full career, and each individual
sends forth his richest, fullest, sweetest strain.  It is in this
decisive moment that all our marriages are made.  So exquisite is the
adaptation of Bass and Treble, of Tenor to Contralto, that oftentimes
the Loved Ones, though twenty thousand leagues away, recognize at once
the responsive note of their destined Lover; and, penetrating the
paltry obstacles of distance, Love unites the three.  The marriage in
that instance consummated results in a threefold Male and Female
offspring which takes its place in Lineland."

"What!  Always threefold?" said I.  "Must one wife then always have
twins?"

"Bass-voice Monstrosity! yes," replied the King.  "How else could the
balance of the Sexes be maintained, if two girls were not born for
every boy?  Would you ignore the very Alphabet of Nature?" He ceased,
speechless for fury; and some time elapsed before I could induce him to
resume his narrative.

"You will not, of course, suppose that every bachelor among us finds
his mates at the first wooing in this universal Marriage Chorus.  On
the contrary, the process is by most of us many times repeated.  Few
are the hearts whose happy lot is at once to recognize in each other's
voice the partner intended for them by Providence, and to fly into a
reciprocal and perfectly harmonious embrace.  With most of us the
courtship is of long duration.  The Wooer's voices may perhaps accord
with one of the future wives, but not with both; or not, at first, with
either; or the Soprano and Contralto may not quite harmonize.  In such
cases Nature has provided that every weekly Chorus shall bring the
three Lovers into closer harmony.  Each trial of voice, each fresh
discovery of discord, almost imperceptibly induces the less perfect to
modify his or her vocal utterance so as to approximate to the more
perfect.  And after many trials and many approximations, the result is
at last achieved.  There comes a day at last when, while the wonted
Marriage Chorus goes forth from universal Lineland, the three far-off
Lovers suddenly find themselves in exact harmony, and, before they are
aware, the wedded Triplet is rapt vocally into a duplicate embrace; and
Nature rejoices over one more marriage and over three more births."




SECTION 14  How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland


Thinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures
to the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up to
him some glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature of things
in Flatland.  So I began thus:  "How does your Royal Highness
distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects?  I for my part
noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some
of your people are lines and others Points; and that some of the lines
are larger--"  "You speak of an impossibility," interrupted the King;
"you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a
Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the
nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of
hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained.
Behold me--I am a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of
Space--" "Of Length," I ventured to suggest.  "Fool," said he, "Space
is Length.  Interrupt me again, and I have done."

I apologized; but he continued scornfully, "Since you are impervious to
argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I
reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles
seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the
other to the South.  Listen, I call to them."

He chirruped, and then complacently continued:  "My wives at this
moment receiving the sound of one of my voice, closely followed by the
other, and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in
which sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is
6.457 inches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my
shape to be 6.457 inches.  But you will of course understand that my
wives do not make this calculation every time they hear my two voices.
They made it, once for all, before we were married.  But they COULD
make it at any time.  And in the same way I can estimate the shape of
any of my Male subjects by the sense of sound."

"But how," said I, "if a Man feigns a Woman's voice with one of his two
voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognized
as the echo of the Northern?  May not such deceptions cause great
inconvenience?  And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind
by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?" This of
course was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered
the purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I
succeeded perfectly.

"What!" cried he in horror, "explain your meaning."  "Feel, touch, come
into contact," I replied.  "If you mean by FEELING," said the King,
"approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals,
know, Stranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by
death.  And the reason is obvious.  The frail form of a Woman, being
liable to be shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by
the State; but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of
sight from Men, the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman
shall be approached so closely as to destroy the interval between the
approximator and the approximated.

"And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal and
unnatural excess of approximation which you call TOUCHING, when all the
ends of so brutal and course a process are attained at once more easily
and more exactly by the sense of hearing?  As to your suggested danger
of deception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the essence of
one's Being, cannot be thus changed at will.  But come, suppose that I
had the power of passing through solid things, so that I could
penetrate my subjects, one after another, even to the number of a
billion, verifying the size and distance of each by the sense of
FEELING:  How much time and energy would be wasted in this clumsy and
inaccurate method!  Whereas now, in one moment of audition, I take as
it were the census and statistics, local, corporeal, mental and
spiritual, of every living being in Lineland.  Hark, only hark!"

So saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy, to a sound which
seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable
multitude of lilliputian grasshoppers.

"Truly," replied I, "your sense of hearing serves you in good stead,
and fills up many of your deficiencies.  But permit me to point out
that your life in Lineland must be deplorably dull.  To see nothing but
a Point!  Not even to be able to contemplate a Straight Line!  Nay, not
even to know what a Straight Line is!  To see, yet to be cut off from
those Linear prospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland!  Better
surely to have no sense of sight at all than to see so little!  I grant
you I have not your discriminative faculty of hearing; for the concert
of all Lineland which gives you such intense pleasure, is to me no
better than a multitudinous twittering or chirping.  But at least I can
discern, by sight, a Line from a Point.  And let me prove it.  Just
before I came into your kingdom, I saw you dancing from left to right,
and then from right to left, with Seven Men and a Woman in your
immediate proximity on the left, and eight Men and two Women on your
right.  Is not this correct?"

"It is correct," said the King, "so far as the numbers and sexes are
concerned, though I know not what you mean by 'right' and 'left.' But I
deny that you saw these things.  For how could you see the Line, that
is to say the inside, of any Man?  But you must have heard these
things, and then dreamed that you saw them.  And let me ask what you
mean by those words 'left' and 'right.'  I suppose it is your way of
saying Northward and Southward."

"Not so," replied I; "besides your motion of Northward and Southward,
there is another motion which I call from right to left."

King.  Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.

I.  Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line
altogether.

King.  Out of my Line?  Do you mean out of the world?  Out of Space?

I.  Well, yes.  Out of YOUR world.  Out of YOUR Space.  For your Space
is not the true Space.  True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a
Line.

King.  If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by
yourself moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.

I.  If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear that no
words of mine can make my meaning clearer to you.  But surely you
cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction.

King.  I do not in the least understand you.

I.  Alas!  How shall I make it clear?  When you move straight on, does
it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way,
turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which
your side is now fronting?  In other words, instead of always moving in
the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to
move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?

King.  Never.  And what do you mean?  How can a man's inside "front" in
any direction?  Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?

I.  Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds,
and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire
to indicate to you.

At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland.  As long as any
part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept
exclaiming, "I see you, I see you still; you are not moving." But when
I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest
voice, "She is vanished; she is dead."  "I am not dead," replied I; "I
am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line
which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things as
they are.  And at this moment I can see your Line, or side--or inside
as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men and Women on
the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate, describing their
order, their size, and the interval between each."

When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, "Does that
at last convince you?"  And, with that, I once more entered Lineland,
taking up the same position as before.

But the Monarch replied, "If you were a Man of sense--though, as you
appear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a Man but
a Woman--but, if you had a particle of sense, you would listen to
reason.  You ask me to believe that there is another Line besides that
which my senses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am
daily conscious.  I, in return, ask you to describe in words or
indicate by motion that other Line of which you speak.  Instead of
moving, you merely exercise some magic art of vanishing and returning
to sight; and instead of any lucid description of your new World, you
simply tell me the numbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts
known to any child in my capital.  Can anything be more irrational or
audacious?  Acknowledge your folly or depart from my dominions."

Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed
to be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms, "Besotted
Being!  You think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are
in reality the most imperfect and imbecile.  You profess to see,
whereas you see nothing but a Point!  You plume yourself on inferring
the existence of a Straight Line; but I CAN SEE Straight Lines, and
infer the existence of Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons,
and even Circles.  Why waste more words?  Suffice it that I am the
completion of your incomplete self.  You are a Line, but I am a Line of
Lines called in my country a Square:  and even I, infinitely superior
though I am to you, am of little account among the great nobles of
Flatland, whence I have come to visit you, in the hope of enlightening
your ignorance."

Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as
if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same movement there
arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing
in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of
a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery of a thousand
Pentagons.  Spell-bound and motionless, I could neither speak nor move
to avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder,
and the King came closer, when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell
recalling me to the realities of Flatland.




SECTION 15  Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland


From dreams I proceed to facts.

It was the last day of our 1999th year of our era.  The patterning of
the rain had long ago announced nightfall; and I was sitting (footnote
3) in the company of my wife, musing on the events of the past and the
prospects of the coming year, the coming century, the coming Millennium.

My four Sons and two orphan Grandchildren had retired to their several
apartments; and my wife alone remained with me to see the old
Millennium out and the new one in.

I was rapt in thought, pondering in my mind some words that had
casually issued from the mouth of my youngest Grandson, a most
promising young Hexagon of unusual brilliancy and perfect angularity.
His uncles and I had been giving him his usual practical lesson in
Sight Recognition, turning ourselves upon our centres, now rapidly, now
more slowly, and questioning him as to our positions; and his answers
had been so satisfactory that I had been induced to reward him by
giving him a few hints on Arithmetic, as applied to Geometry.

Taking nine Squares, each an inch every way, I had put them together so
as to make one large Square, with a side of three inches, and I had
hence proved to my little Grandson that--though it was impossible for
us to SEE the inside of the Square--yet we might ascertain the number
of square inches in a Square by simply squaring the number of inches in
the side:  "and thus," said I, "we know that three-to-the-second, or
nine, represents the number of square inches in a Square whose side is
three inches long."

The little Hexagon meditated on this a while and then said to me; "But
you have been teaching me to raise numbers to the third power: I
suppose three-to-the-third must mean something in Geometry; what does
it mean?"  "Nothing at all," replied I, "not at least in Geometry; for
Geometry has only Two Dimensions."  And then I began to shew the boy
how a Point by moving through a length of three inches makes a Line of
three inches, which may be represented by three; and how a Line of
three inches, moving parallel to itself through a length of three
inches, makes a Square of three inches every way, which may be
represented by three-to-the-second.  xxx Upon this, my Grandson, again
returning to his former suggestion, took me up rather suddenly and
exclaimed, "Well, then, if a Point by moving three inches, makes a Line
of three inches represented by three; and if a straight Line of three
inches, moving parallel to itself, makes a Square of three inches every
way, represented by three-to-the-second; it must be that a Square of
three inches every way, moving somehow parallel to itself (but I don't
see how) must make Something else (but I don't see what) of three
inches every way--and this must be represented by three-to-the-third."

"Go to bed," said I, a little ruffled by this interruption: "if you
would talk less nonsense, you would remember more sense."

So my Grandson had disappeared in disgrace; and there I sat by my
Wife's side, endeavouring to form a retrospect of the year 1999 and of
the possibilities of the year 2000; but not quite able to shake of the
thoughts suggested by the prattle of my bright little Hexagon.  Only a
few sands now remained in the half-hour glass.  Rousing myself from my
reverie I turned the glass Northward for the last time in the old
Millennium; and in the act, I exclaimed aloud, "The boy is a fool."

Straightway I became conscious of a Presence in the room, and a
chilling breath thrilled through my very being.  "He is no such thing,"
cried my Wife, "and you are breaking the Commandments in thus
dishonouring your own Grandson."  But I took no notice of her.  Looking
around in every direction I could see nothing; yet still I FELT a
Presence, and shivered as the cold whisper came again.  I started up.
"What is the matter?" said my Wife, "there is no draught; what are you
looking for?  There is nothing."  There was nothing; and I resumed my
seat, again exclaiming, "The boy is a fool, I say; three-to-the-third
can have no meaning in Geometry." At once there came a distinctly
audible reply, "The boy is not a fool; and three-to-the-third has an
obvious Geometrical meaning."

My Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not
understand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the
direction of the sound.  What was our horror when we saw before us a
Figure!  At the first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways;
but a moment's observation shewed me that the extremities passed into
dimness too rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should
have thought it a Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a
manner impossible for a Circle or for any regular Figure of which I had
had experience.

But my Wife had not my experience, nor the coolness necessary to note
these characteristics.  With the usual hastiness and unreasoning
jealousy of her Sex, she flew at once to the conclusion that a Woman
had entered the house through some small aperture.  "How comes this
person here?" she exclaimed, "you promised me, my dear, that there
should be no ventilators in our new house."  "Nor are they any," said
I; "but what makes you think that the stranger is a Woman?  I see by my
power of Sight Recognition--"

"Oh, I have no patience with your Sight Recognition," replied she,
"'Feeling is believing' and 'A Straight Line to the touch is worth a
Circle to the sight'"--two Proverbs, very common with the Frailer Sex
in Flatland.

"Well," said I, for I was afraid of irritating her, "if it must be so,
demand an introduction."  Assuming her most gracious manner, my Wife
advanced towards the Stranger, "Permit me, Madam to feel and be felt
by--" then, suddenly recoiling, "Oh! it is not a Woman, and there are
no angles either, not a trace of one.  Can it be that I have so
misbehaved to a perfect Circle?"

"I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle," replied the Voice, "and a
more perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more accurately,
I am many Circles in one."  Then he added more mildly, "I have a
message, dear Madam, to your husband, which I must not deliver in your
presence; and, if you would suffer us to retire for a few minutes--"
But my wife would not listen to the proposal that our august Visitor
should so incommode himself, and assuring the Circle that the hour of
her own retirement had long passed, with many reiterated apologies for
her recent indiscretion, she at last retreated to her apartment.

I glanced at the half-hour glass.  The last sands had fallen.  The
third Millennium had begun.


Footnote 3.  When I say "sitting," of course I do not mean any change
of attitude such as you in Spaceland signify by that word; for as we
have no feet, we can no more "sit" nor "stand" (in your sense of the
word) than one of your soles or flounders.

Nevertheless, we perfectly well recognize the different mental states
of volition implied by "lying," "sitting," and "standing," which are to
some extent indicated to a beholder by a slight increase of lustre
corresponding to the increase of volition.

But on this, and a thousand other kindred subjects, time forbids me to
dwell.




SECTION 16  How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me
             in words the mysteries of Spaceland


As soon as the sound of the Peace-cry of my departing Wife had died
away, I began to approach the Stranger with the intention of taking a
nearer view and of bidding him be seated:  but his appearance struck me
dumb and motionless with astonishment.  Without the slightest symptoms
of angularity he nevertheless varied every instant with graduations of
size and brightness scarcely possible for any Figure within the scope
of my experience.  The thought flashed across me that I might have
before me a burglar or cut-throat, some monstrous Irregular Isosceles,
who, by feigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow
into the house, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.

In a sitting-room, the absence of Fog (and the season happened to be
remarkably dry), made it difficult for me to trust to Sight
Recognition, especially at the short distance at which I was standing.
Desperate with fear, I rushed forward with an unceremonious, "You must
permit me, Sir--" and felt him.  My Wife was right.  There was not the
trace of an angle, not the slightest roughness or inequality: never in
my life had I met with a more perfect Circle.  He remained motionless
while I walked around him, beginning from his eye and returning to it
again.  Circular he was throughout, a perfectly satisfactory Circle;
there could not be a doubt of it.  Then followed a dialogue, which I
will endeavour to set down as near as I can recollect it, omitting only
some of my profuse apologies--for I was covered with shame and
humiliation that I, a Square, should have been guilty of the
impertinence of feeling a Circle.  It was commenced by the Stranger
with some impatience at the lengthiness of my introductory process.

Stranger.  Have you felt me enough by this time?  Are you not
introduced to me yet?

I.  Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not from
ignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little surprise
and nervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit.  And I
beseech you to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially not to
my Wife.  But before your Lordship enters into further communications,
would he deign to satisfy the curiosity of one who would gladly know
whence his visitor came?

Stranger.  From Space, from Space, Sir:  whence else?

I.  Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space, your
Lordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?

Stranger.  Pooh! what do you know of Space?  Define Space.

I.  Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.

Stranger.  Exactly:  you see you do not even know what Space is.  You
think it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce to you
a Third--height, breadth, and length.

I.  Your Lordship is pleased to be merry.  We also speak of length and
height, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions by four
names.

Stranger.  But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.

I.  Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me in what direction is
the Third Dimension, unknown to me?

Stranger.  I came from it.  It is up above and down below.

I.  My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.

Stranger.  I mean nothing of the kind.  I mean a direction in which you
cannot look, because you have no eye in your side.

I.  Pardon me, my Lord, a moment's inspection will convince your
Lordship that I have a perfectly luminary at the juncture of my two
sides.

Stranger:  Yes:  but in order to see into Space you ought to have an
eye, not on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you
would probably call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it
your side.

I.  An eye in my inside!  An eye in my stomach!  Your Lordship jests.

Stranger.  I am in no jesting humour.  I tell you that I come from
Space, or, since you will not understand what Space means, from the
Land of Three Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your
Plane which you call Space forsooth.  From that position of advantage I
discerned all that you speak of as SOLID (by which you mean "enclosed
on four sides"), your houses, your churches, your very chests and
safes, yes even your insides and stomachs, all lying open and exposed
to my view.

I.  Such assertions are easily made, my Lord.

Stranger.  But not easily proved, you mean.  But I mean to prove mine.

When I descended here, I saw your four Sons, the Pentagons, each in his
apartment, and your two Grandsons the Hexagons; I saw your youngest
Hexagon remain a while with you and then retire to his room, leaving
you and your Wife alone.  I saw your Isosceles servants, three in
number, in the kitchen at supper, and the little Page in the scullery.
Then I came here, and how do you think I came?

I.  Through the roof, I suppose.

Strange.  Not so.  Your roof, as you know very well, has been recently
repaired, and has no aperture by which even a Woman could penetrate.  I
tell you I come from Space.  Are you not convinced by what I have told
you of your children and household?

I.  Your Lordship must be aware that such facts touching the belongings
of his humble servant might be easily ascertained by any one of the
neighbourhood possessing your Lordship's ample means of information.

Stranger.  (TO HIMSELF.)  What must I do?  Stay; one more argument
suggests itself to me.  When you see a Straight Line-- your wife, for
example--how many Dimensions do you attribute to her?

I.  Your Lordship would treat me as if I were one of the vulgar who,
being ignorant of Mathematics, suppose that a Woman is really a
Straight Line, and only of One Dimension.  No, no, my Lord; we Squares
are better advised, and are as well aware of your Lordship that a
Woman, though popularly called a Straight Line, is, really and
scientifically, a very thin Parallelogram, possessing Two Dimensions,
like the rest of us, viz., length and breadth (or thickness).

Stranger.  But the very fact that a Line is visible implies that it
possesses yet another Dimension.

I.  My Lord, I have just acknowledged that a Woman is broad as well as
long.  We see her length, we infer her breadth; which, though very
slight, is capable of measurement.

Stranger.  You do not understand me.  I mean that when you see a Woman,
you ought--besides inferring her breadth--to see her length, and to SEE
what we call her HEIGHT; although the last Dimension is infinitesimal
in your country.  If a Line were mere length without "height," it would
cease to occupy Space and would become invisible.  Surely you must
recognize this?

I.  I must indeed confess that I do not in the least understand your
Lordship.  When we in Flatland see a Line, we see length and
BRIGHTNESS.  If the brightness disappears, the Line is extinguished,
and, as you say, ceases to occupy Space.  But am I to suppose that your
Lordship gives the brightness the title of a Dimension, and that what
we call "bright" you call "high"?

Stranger.  No, indeed.  By "height" I mean a Dimension like your
length: only, with you, "height" is not so easily perceptible, being
extremely small.

I.  My Lord, your assertion is easily put to the test.  You say I have
a Third Dimension, which you call "height."  Now, Dimension implies
direction and measurement.  Do but measure my "height," or merely
indicate to me the direction in which my "height" extends, and I will
become your convert.  Otherwise, your Lordship's own understand must
hold me excused.

Stranger.  (TO HIMSELF.)  I can do neither.  How shall I convince him?
Surely a plain statement of facts followed by ocular demonstration
ought to suffice.  --Now, Sir; listen to me.

You are living on a Plane.  What you style Flatland is the vast level
surface of what I may call a fluid, or in, the top of which you and
your countrymen move about, without rising above or falling below it.

I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid.  You call me a Circle; but in
reality I am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size
varying from a Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one
placed on the top of the other.  When I cut through your plane as I am
now doing, I make in your plane a section which you, very rightly, call
a Circle.  For even a Sphere--which is my proper name in my own
country--if he manifest himself at all to an inhabitant of
Flatland--must needs manifest himself as a Circle.

Do you not remember--for I, who see all things, discerned last night
the phantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain--do you not
remember, I say, how when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were
compelled to manifest yourself to the King, not as a Square, but as a
Line, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent
the whole of you, but only a slice or section of you?  In precisely the
same way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious enough to
represent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice or section
of me, which is what you call a Circle.

The diminished brightness of your eye indicates incredulity.  But now
prepare to receive proof positive of the truth of my assertions.  You
cannot indeed see more than one of my sections, or Circles, at a time;
for you have no power to raise your eye out of the plane of Flatland;
but you can at least see that, as I rise in Space, so my sections
become smaller.  See now, I will rise; and the effect upon your eye
will be that my Circle will become smaller and smaller till it dwindles
to a point and finally vanishes.

There was no "rising" that I could see; but he diminished and finally
vanished.  I winked once or twice to make sure that I was not dreaming.
But it was no dream.  For from the depths of nowhere came forth a
hollow voice--close to my heart it seemed--"Am I quite gone?  Are you
convinced now?  Well, now I will gradually return to Flatland and you
shall see my section become larger and larger."

Every reader in Spaceland will easily understand that my mysterious
Guest was speaking the language of truth and even of simplicity.  But
to me, proficient though I was in Flatland Mathematics, it was by no
means a simple matter.  The rough diagram given above will make it
clear to any Spaceland child that the Sphere, ascending in the three
positions indicated there, must needs have manifested himself to me, or
to any Flatlander, as a Circle, at first of full size, then small, and
at last very small indeed, approaching to a Point.  But to me, although
I saw the facts before me, the causes were as dark as ever.  All that I
could comprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and
vanished, and that he had now re-appeared and was rapidly making
himself larger.

When he regained his original size, he heaved a deep sigh; for he
perceived by my silence that I had altogether failed to comprehend him.
And indeed I was now inclining to the belief that he must be no Circle
at all, but some extremely clever juggler; or else that the old wives'
tales were true, and that after all there were such people as
Enchanters and Magicians.

After a long pause he muttered to himself, "One resource alone remains,
if I am not to resort to action.  I must try the method of Analogy."
Then followed a still longer silence, after which he continued our
dialogue.

Sphere.  Tell me, Mr. Mathematician; if a Point moves Northward, and
leaves a luminous wake, what name would you give to the wake?

I.  A straight Line.

Sphere.  And a straight Line has how many extremities?

I.  Two.

Sphere.  Now conceive the Northward straight Line moving parallel to
itself, East and West, so that every point in it leaves behind it the
wake of a straight Line.  What name will you give to the Figure thereby
formed?  We will suppose that it moves through a distance equal to the
original straight line. --What name, I say?

I.  A square.

Sphere.  And how many sides has a Square?  How many angles?

I.  Four sides and four angles.

Sphere.  Now stretch your imagination a little, and conceive a Square
in Flatland, moving parallel to itself upward.

I.  What?  Northward?

Sphere.  No, not Northward; upward; out of Flatland altogether.

If it moved Northward, the Southern points in the Square would have to
move through the positions previously occupied by the Northern points.
But that is not my meaning.

I mean that every Point in you--for you are a Square and will serve the
purpose of my illustration--every Point in you, that is to say in what
you call your inside, is to pass upwards through Space in such a way
that no Point shall pass through the position previously occupied by
any other Point; but each Point shall describe a straight Line of its
own.  This is all in accordance with Analogy; surely it must be clear
to you.

Restraining my impatience--for I was now under a strong temptation to
rush blindly at my Visitor and to precipitate him into Space, or out of
Flatland, anywhere, so that I could get rid of him--I replied:--

"And what may be the nature of the Figure which I am to shape out by
this motion which you are pleased to denote by the word 'upward'?  I
presume it is describable in the language of Flatland."

Sphere.  Oh, certainly.  It is all plain and simple, and in strict
accordance with Analogy--only, by the way, you must not speak of the
result as being a Figure, but as a Solid.  But I will describe it to
you.  Or rather not I, but Analogy.

We began with a single Point, which of course--being itself a
Point--has only ONE terminal Point.

One Point produces a Line with TWO terminal Points.

One Line produces a Square with FOUR terminal Points.

Now you can give yourself the answer to your own question:  1, 2, 4,
are evidently in Geometrical Progression.  What is the next number?

I.  Eight.

Sphere.  Exactly.  The one Square produces a SOMETHING-WHICH-YOU-
DO-NOT-AS-YET-KNOW-A-NAME-FOR-BUT-WHICH-WE-CALL-A-CUBE with EIGHT
terminal Points.  Now are you convinced?

I.  And has this Creature sides, as well as Angles or what you call
"terminal Points"?

Sphere.  Of course; and all according to Analogy.  But, by the way, not
what YOU call sides, but what WE call sides.  You would call them
SOLIDS.

I.  And how many solids or sides will appertain to this Being whom I am
to generate by the motion of my inside in an "upward" direction, and
whom you call a Cube?

Sphere.  How can you ask?  And you a mathematician!  The side of
anything is always, if I may so say, one Dimension behind the thing.
Consequently, as there is no Dimension behind a Point, a Point has 0
sides; a Line, if I may so say, has 2 sides (for the points of a Line
may be called by courtesy, its sides); a Square has 4 sides; 0, 2, 4;
what Progression do you call that?

I.  Arithmetical.

Sphere.  And what is the next number?

I.  Six.

Sphere.  Exactly.  Then you see you have answered your own question.
The Cube which you will generate will be bounded by six sides, that is
to say, six of your insides.  You see it all now, eh?

"Monster," I shrieked, "be thou juggler, enchanter, dream, or devil, no
more will I endure thy mockeries.  Either thou or I must perish."  And
saying these words I precipitated myself upon him.




SECTION 17  How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to
deeds


It was in vain.  I brought my hardest right angle into violent
collision with the Stranger, pressing on him with a force sufficient to
have destroyed any ordinary Circle:  but I could feel him slowly and
unarrestably slipping from my contact; not edging to the right nor to
the left, but moving somehow out of the world, and vanishing into
nothing.  Soon there was a blank.  But still I heard the Intruder's
voice.

Sphere.  Why will you refuse to listen to reason?  I had hoped to find
in you--as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician--a
fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions, which I am allowed
to preach once only in a thousand years:  but now I know not how to
convince you.  Stay, I have it.  Deeds, and not words, shall proclaim
the truth.  Listen, my friend.

I have told you I can see from my position in Space the inside of all
things that you consider closed.  For example, I see in yonder cupboard
near which you are standing, several of what you call boxes (but like
everything else in Flatland, they have no tops or bottom) full of
money; I see also two tablets of accounts.  I am about to descend into
that cupboard and to bring you one of those tablets.  I saw you lock
the cupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have the key in your
possession.  But I descend from Space; the doors, you see, remain
unmoved.  Now I am in the cupboard and am taking the tablet.  Now I
have it.  Now I ascend with it.

I rushed to the closet and dashed the door open.  One of the tablets
was gone.  With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other
corner of the room, and at the same time the tablet appeared upon the
floor.  I took it up.  There could be no doubt--it was the missing
tablet.

I groaned with horror, doubting whether I was not out of my sense; but
the Stranger continued:  "Surely you must now see that my explanation,
and no other, suits the phenomena.  What you call Solid things are
really superficial; what you call Space is really nothing but a great
Plane.  I am in Space, and look down upon the insides of the things of
which you only see the outsides.  You could leave the Plane yourself,
if you could but summon up the necessary volition.  A slight upward or
downward motion would enable you to see all that I can see.

"The higher I mount, and the further I go from your Plane, the more I
can see, though of course I see it on a smaller scale.  For example, I
am ascending; now I can see your neighbour the Hexagon and his family
in their several apartments; now I see the inside of the Theatre, ten
doors off, from which the audience is only just departing; and on the
other side a Circle in his study, sitting at his books.  Now I shall
come back to you.  And, as a crowning proof, what do you say to my
giving you a touch, just the least touch, in your stomach?  It will not
seriously injure you, and the slight pain you may suffer cannot be
compared with the mental benefit you will receive."

Before I could utter a word of remonstrance, I felt a shooting pain in
my inside, and a demoniacal laugh seemed to issue from within me.  A
moment afterwards the sharp agony had ceased, leaving nothing but a
dull ache behind, and the Stranger began to reappear, saying, as he
gradually increased in size, "There, I have not hurt you much, have I?
If you are not convinced now, I don't know what will convince you.
What say you?"

My resolution was taken.  It seemed intolerable that I should endure
existence subject to the arbitrary visitations of a Magician who could
thus play tricks with one's very stomach.  If only I could in any way
manage to pin him against the wall till help came!

Once more I dashed my hardest angle against him, at the same time
alarming the whole household by my cries for aid.  I believe, at the
moment of my onset, the Stranger had sunk below our Plane, and really
found difficulty in rising.  In any case he remained motionless, while
I, hearing, as I thought, the sound of some help approaching, pressed
against him with redoubled vigor, and continued to shout for assistance.

A convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere.  "This must not be," I
thought I heard him say:  "either he must listen to reason, or I must
have recourse to the last resource of civilization." Then, addressing
me in a louder tone, he hurriedly exclaimed, "Listen: no stranger must
witness what you have witnessed.  Send your Wife back at once, before
she enters the apartment.  The Gospel of Three Dimensions must not be
thus frustrated.  Not thus must the fruits of one thousand years of
waiting be thrown away.  I hear her coming.  Back! back!  Away from me,
or you must go with me--wither you know not--into the Land of Three
Dimensions!"

"Fool!  Madman!  Irregular!" I exclaimed; "never will I release thee;
thou shalt pay the penalty of thine impostures."

"Ha!  Is it come to this?" thundered the Stranger:  "then meet your
fate: out of your Plane you go.  Once, twice, thrice!  'Tis done!"




SECTION 18  How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there


An unspeakable horror seized me.  There was a darkness; then a dizzy,
sickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line
that was no Line; Space that was not Space:  I was myself, and not
myself.  When I could find voice, I shrieked loud in agony, "Either
this is madness or it is Hell."  "It is neither," calmly replied the
voice of the Sphere, "it is Knowledge; it is Three Dimensions:  open
your eye once again and try to look steadily."

I looked, and, behold, a new world!  There stood before me, visibly
incorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured, dreamed, of
perfect Circular beauty.  What seemed the centre of the Stranger's form
lay open to my view:  yet I could see no heart, lungs, nor arteries,
only a beautiful harmonious Something--for which I had no words; but
you, my Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of the Sphere.

Prostrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, "How is it, O
divine ideal of consummate loveliness and wisdom that I see thy inside,
and yet cannot discern thy heart, thy lungs, thy arteries, thy liver?"
"What you think you see, you see not," he replied; "it is not giving to
you, nor to any other Being, to behold my internal parts. I am of a
different order of Beings from those in Flatland.  Were I a Circle, you
could discern my intestines, but I am a Being, composed as I told you
before, of many Circles, the Many in the One, called in this country a
Sphere.  And, just as the outside of a Cube is a Square, so the outside
of a Sphere represents the appearance of a Circle."

Bewildered though I was by my Teacher's enigmatic utterance, I no
longer chafed against it, but worshipped him in silent adoration.  He
continued, with more mildness in his voice.  "Distress not yourself if
you cannot at first understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland.  By
degrees they will dawn upon you.  Let us begin by casting back a glance
at the region whence you came.  Return with me a while to the plains of
Flatland and I will shew you that which you have often reasoned and
thought about, but never seen with the sense of sight--a visible
angle."  "Impossible!" I cried; but, the Sphere leading the way, I
followed as if in a dream, till once more his voice arrested me: "Look
yonder, and behold your own Pentagonal house, and all its inmates."

I looked below, and saw with my physical eye all that domestic
individuality which I had hitherto merely inferred with the
understanding.  And how poor and shadowy was the inferred conjecture in
comparison with the reality which I now behold!  My four Sons calmly
asleep in the North-Western rooms, my two orphan Grandsons to the
South; the Servants, the Butler, my Daughter, all in their several
apartments.  Only my affectionate Wife, alarmed by my continued
absence, had quitted her room and was roving up and down in the Hall,
anxiously awaiting my return.  Also the Page, aroused by my cries, had
left his room, and under pretext of ascertaining whether I had fallen
somewhere in a faint, was prying into the cabinet in my study.  All
this I could now SEE, not merely infer; and as we came nearer and
nearer, I could discern even the contents of my cabinet, and the two
chests of gold, and the tablets of which the Sphere had made mention.

Touched by my Wife's distress, I would have sprung downward to reassure
her, but I found myself incapable of motion.  "Trouble not yourself
about your Wife," said my Guide: "she will not be long left in anxiety;
meantime, let us take a survey of Flatland."

Once more I felt myself rising through space.  It was even as the
Sphere had said.  The further we receded from the object we beheld, the
larger became the field of vision.  My native city, with the interior
of every house and every creature therein, lay open to my view in
miniature.  We mounted higher, and lo, the secrets of the earth, the
depths of the mines and inmost caverns of the hills, were bared before
me.

Awestruck at the sight of the mysteries of the earth, thus unveiled
before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, "Behold, I am become as
a God.  For the wise men in our country say that to see all things, or
as they express it, OMNIVIDENCE, is the attribute of God alone." There
was something of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer:
"is it so indeed?  Then the very pick-pockets and cut-throats of my
country are to be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods: for there
is not one of them that does not see as much as you see now.  But trust
me, your wise men are wrong."

I.  Then is omnividence the attribute of others besides Gods?

Sphere.  I do not know.  But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat of our
country can see everything that is in your country, surely that is no
reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted by you as a
God.  This omnividence, as you call it--it is not a common word in
Spaceland--does it make you more just, more merciful, less selfish,
more loving?  Not in the least.  Then how does it make you more divine?

I.  "More merciful, more loving!"  But these are the qualities of
women!  And we know that a Circle is a higher Being than a Straight
Line, in so far as knowledge and wisdom are more to be esteemed than
mere affection.

Sphere.  It is not for me to classify human faculties according to
merit.  Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more of the
affections than of the understanding, more of your despised Straight Lines
than of your belauded Circles.  But enough of this.  Look yonder.  Do
you know that building?

I looked, and afar off I saw an immense Polygonal structure, in which I
recognized the General Assembly Hall of the States of Flatland,
surrounded by dense lines of Pentagonal buildings at right angles to
each other, which I knew to be streets; and I perceived that I was
approaching the great Metropolis.

"Here we descend," said my Guide.  It was now morning, the first hour
of the first day of the two thousandth year of our era.  Acting, as was
their wont, in strict accordance with precedent, the highest Circles of
the realm were meeting in solemn conclave, as they had met on the first
hour of the first day of the year 1000, and also on the first hour of
the first day of the year 0.

The minutes of the previous meetings were now read by one whom I at
once recognized as my brother, a perfectly Symmetrical Square, and the
Chief Clerk of the High Council.  It was found recorded on each
occasion that:  "Whereas the States had been troubled by divers
ill-intentioned persons pretending to have received revelations from
another World, and professing to produce demonstrations whereby they
had instigated to frenzy both themselves and others, it had been for
this cause unanimously resolved by the Grand Council that on the first
day of each millenary, special injunctions be sent to the Prefects in
the several districts of Flatland, to make strict search for such
misguided persons, and without formality of mathematical examination,
to destroy all such as were Isosceles of any degree, to scourge and
imprison any regular Triangle, to cause any Square or Pentagon to be
sent to the district Asylum, and to arrest any one of higher rank,
sending him straightway to the Capital to be examined and judged by the
Council."

"You hear your fate," said the Sphere to me, while the Council was
passing for the third time the formal resolution.  "Death or
imprisonment awaits the Apostle of the Gospel of Three Dimensions."
"Not so," replied I, "the matter is now so clear to me, the nature of
real space so palpable, that methinks I could make a child understand
it.  Permit me but to descend at this moment and enlighten them." "Not
yet," said my Guide, "the time will come for that.  Meantime I must
perform my mission.  Stay thou there in thy place." Saying these words,
he leaped with great dexterity into the sea (if I may so call it) of
Flatland, right in the midst of the ring of Counsellors.  "I come,"
said he, "to proclaim that there is a land of Three Dimensions."

I could see many of the younger Counsellors start back in manifest
horror, as the Sphere's circular section widened before them.  But on a
sign from the presiding Circle--who shewed not the slightest alarm or
surprise--six Isosceles of a low type from six different quarters
rushed upon the Sphere.  "We have him," they cried; "No; yes; we have
him still! he's going! he's gone!"

"My Lords," said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council,
"there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives, to
which I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence happened
on the last two millennial commencements.  You will, of course, say
nothing of these trifles outside the Cabinet."

Raising his voice, he now summoned the guards.  "Arrest the policemen;
gag them.  You know your duty."  After he had consigned to their fate
the wretched policemen--ill-fated and unwilling witnesses of a
State-secret which they were not to be permitted to reveal--he again
addressed the Counsellors.  "My Lords, the business of the Council
being concluded, I have only to wish you a happy New Year." Before
departing, he expressed, at some length, to the Clerk, my excellent but
most unfortunate brother, his sincere regret that, in accordance with
precedent and for the sake of secrecy, he must condemn him to perpetual
imprisonment, but added his satisfaction that, unless some mention were
made by him of that day's incident, his life would be spared.




SECTION 19  How, though the Sphere shewed me other mysteries of
            Spaceland, I still desire more; and what came of it


When I saw my poor brother led away to imprisonment, I attempted to
leap down into the Council Chamber, desiring to intercede on his
behalf, or at least bid him farewell.  But I found that I had no motion
of my own.  I absolutely depended on the volition of my Guide, who said
in gloomy tones, "Heed not thy brother; haply thou shalt have ample
time hereafter to condole with him.  Follow me."

Once more we ascended into space.  "Hitherto," said the Sphere, "I have
shewn you naught save Plane Figures and their interiors.  Now I must
introduce you to Solids, and reveal to you the plan upon which they are
constructed.  Behold this multitude of moveable square cards.  See, I
put one on another, not, as you supposed, Northward of the other, but
ON the other.  Now a second, now a third.  See, I am building up a
Solid by a multitude of Squares parallel to one another.  Now the Solid
is complete, being as high as it is long and broad, and we call it a
Cube."

"Pardon me, my Lord," replied I; "but to my eye the appearance is as of
an Irregular Figure whose inside is laid open to view; in other words,
methinks I see no Solid, but a Plane such as we infer in Flatland; only
of an Irregularity which betokens some monstrous criminal, so that the
very sight of it is painful to my eyes."

"True," said the Sphere; "it appears to you a Plane, because you are
not accustomed to light and shade and perspective; just as in Flatland
a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of
Sight Recognition.  But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by
the sense of Feeling."

He then introduced me to the Cube, and I found that this marvellous
Being was indeed no Plane, but a Solid; and that he was endowed with
six plane sides and eight terminal points called solid angles; and I
remembered the saying of the Sphere that just such a Creature as this
would be formed by the Square moving, in Space, parallel to himself:
and I rejoiced to think that so insignificant a Creature as I could in
some sense be called the Progenitor of so illustrious an offspring.

But still I could not fully understand the meaning of what my Teacher
had told me concerning "light" and "shade" and "perspective"; and I did
not hesitate to put my difficulties before him.

Were I to give the Sphere's explanation of these matters, succinct and
clear though it was, it would be tedious to an inhabitant of Space, who
knows these things already.  Suffice it, that by his lucid statements,
and by changing the position of objects and lights, and by allowing me
to feel the several objects and even his own sacred Person, he at last
made all things clear to me, so that I could now readily distinguish
between a Circle and a Sphere, a Plane Figure and a Solid.

This was the Climax, the Paradise, of my strange eventful History.
Henceforth I have to relate the story of my miserable Fall:--most
miserable, yet surely most undeserved!  For why should the thirst for
knowledge be aroused, only to be disappointed and punished?  My
volition shrinks from the painful task of recalling my humiliation;
yet, like a second Prometheus, I will endure this and worse, if by any
means I may arouse in the interiors of Plane and Solid Humanity a
spirit of rebellion against the Conceit which would limit our
Dimensions to Two or Three or any number short of Infinity.  Away then
with all personal considerations!  Let me continue to the end, as I
began, without further digressions or anticipations, pursuing the plain
path of dispassionate History.  The exact facts, the exact words,--and
they are burnt in upon my brain,--shall be set down without alteration
of an iota; and let my Readers judge between me and Destiny.

The Sphere would willingly have continued his lessons by indoctrinating
me in the conformation of all regular Solids, Cylinders, Cones,
Pyramids, Pentahedrons, Hexahedrons, Dodecahedrons, and Spheres:  but I
ventured to interrupt him.  Not that I was wearied of knowledge.  On
the contrary, I thirsted for yet deeper and fuller draughts than he was
offering to me.

"Pardon me," said I, "O Thou Whom I must no longer address as the
Perfection of all Beauty; but let me beg thee to vouchsafe thy servant
a sight of thine interior."

Sphere.  My what?

I.  Thine interior:  thy stomach, thy intestines.

Sphere.  Whence this ill-timed impertinent request?  And what mean you
by saying that I am no longer the Perfection of all Beauty?

I.  My Lord, your own wisdom has taught me to aspire to One even more
great, more beautiful, and more closely approximate to Perfection than
yourself.  As you yourself, superior to all Flatland forms, combine
many Circles in One, so doubtless there is One above you who combines
many Spheres in One Supreme Existence, surpassing even the Solids of
Spaceland.  And even as we, who are now in Space, look down on Flatland
and see the insides of all things, so of a certainty there is yet above
us some higher, purer region, whither thou dost surely purpose to lead
me--O Thou Whom I shall always call, everywhere and in all Dimensions,
my Priest, Philosopher, and Friend--some yet more spacious Space, some
more dimensionable Dimensionality, from the vantage-ground of which we
shall look down together upon the revealed insides of Solid things, and
where thine own intestines, and those of thy kindred Spheres, will lie
exposed to the view of the poor wandering exile from Flatland, to whom
so much has already been vouchsafed.

Sphere.  Pooh!  Stuff!  Enough of this trifling!  The time is short,
and much remains to be done before you are fit to proclaim the Gospel
of Three Dimensions to your blind benighted countrymen in Flatland.

I.  Nay, gracious Teacher, deny me not what I know it is in thy power
to perform.  Grant me but one glimpse of thine interior, and I am
satisfied for ever, remaining henceforth thy docile pupil, thy
unemancipable slave, ready to receive all thy teachings and to feed upon
the words that fall from thy lips.

Sphere.  Well, then, to content and silence you, let me say at once, I
would shew you what you wish if I could; but I cannot.  Would you have
me turn my stomach inside out to oblige you?

I.  But my Lord has shewn me the intestines of all my countrymen in the
Land of Two Dimensions by taking me with him into the Land of Three.
What therefore more easy than now to take his servant on a second
journey into the blessed region of the Fourth Dimension, where I shall
look down with him once more upon this land of Three Dimensions, and
see the inside of every three-dimensioned house, the secrets of the
solid earth, the treasures of the mines of Spaceland, and the
intestines of every solid living creature, even the noble and adorable
Spheres.

Sphere.  But where is this land of Four Dimensions?

I.  I know not:  but doubtless my Teacher knows.

Sphere.  Not I.  There is no such land.  The very idea of it is utterly
inconceivable.

I.  Not inconceivable, my Lord, to me, and therefore still less
inconceivable to my Master.  Nay, I despair not that, even here, in
this region of Three Dimensions, your Lordship's art may make the
Fourth Dimension visible to me; just as in the Land of Two Dimensions
my Teacher's skill would fain have opened the eyes of his blind servant
to the invisible presence of a Third Dimension, though I saw it not.

Let me recall the past.  Was I not taught below that when I saw a Line
and inferred a Plane, I in reality saw a Third unrecognized Dimension,
not the same as brightness, called "height"?  And does it not now
follow that, in this region, when I see a Plane and infer a Solid, I
really see a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, not the same as colour, but
existent, though infinitesimal and incapable of measurement?

And besides this, there is the Argument from Analogy of Figures.

Sphere.  Analogy!  Nonsense:  what analogy?

I.  Your Lordship tempts his servant to see whether he remembers the
revelations imparted to him.  Trifle not with me, my Lord; I crave, I
thirst, for more knowledge.  Doubtless we cannot SEE that other higher
Spaceland now, because we have no eye in our stomachs.  But, just as
there WAS the realm of Flatland, though that poor puny Lineland Monarch
could neither turn to left nor right to discern it, and just as there
WAS close at hand, and touching my frame, the land of Three Dimensions,
though I, blind senseless wretch, had no power to touch it, no eye in
my interior to discern it, so of a surety there is a Fourth Dimension,
which my Lord perceives with the inner eye of thought.  And that it
must exist my Lord himself has taught me.  Or can he have forgotten
what he himself imparted to his servant?

In One Dimension, did not a moving Point produce a Line with TWO
terminal points?

In Two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a Square with FOUR
terminal points?

In Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce--did not this eye
of mine behold it--that blessed Being, a Cube, with EIGHT terminal
points?

And in Four Dimensions shall not a moving Cube--alas, for Analogy, and
alas for the Progress of Truth, if it be not so--shall not, I say, the
motion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine Organization with
SIXTEEN terminal points?

Behold the infallible confirmation of the Series, 2, 4, 8, 16:  is not
this a Geometrical Progression?  Is not this--if I might quote my
Lord's own words--"strictly according to Analogy"?

Again, was I not taught by my Lord that as in a Line there are TWO
bounding Points, and in a Square there are FOUR bounding Lines, so in a
Cube there must be SIX bounding Squares?  Behold once more the
confirming Series, 2, 4, 6:  is not this an Arithmetical Progression?
And consequently does it not of necessity follow that the more divine
offspring of the divine Cube in the Land of Four Dimensions, must have
8 bounding Cubes: and is not this also, as my Lord has taught me to
believe, "strictly according to Analogy"?  O, my Lord, my Lord, behold,
I cast myself in faith upon conjecture, not knowing the facts; and I
appeal to your Lordship to confirm or deny my logical anticipations.
If I am wrong, I yield, and will no longer demand a Fourth Dimension;
but, if I am right, my Lord will listen to reason.

I ask therefore, is it, or is it not, the fact, that ere now your
countrymen also have witnessed the descent of Beings of a higher order
than their own, entering closed rooms, even as your Lordship entered
mine, without the opening of doors or windows, and appearing and
vanishing at will?  On the reply to this question I am ready to stake
everything.  Deny it, and I am henceforth silent.  Only vouchsafe an
answer.

Sphere (AFTER A PAUSE).  It is reported so.  But men are divided in
opinion as to the facts.  And even granting the facts, they explain
them in different ways.  And in any case, however great may be the
number of different explanations, no one has adopted or suggested the
theory of a Fourth Dimension.  Therefore, pray have done with this
trifling, and let us return to business.

I.  I was certain of it.  I was certain that my anticipations would be
fulfilled.  And now have patience with me and answer me yet one more
question, best of Teachers!  Those who have thus appeared--no one knows
whence--and have returned--no one knows whither--have they also
contracted their sections and vanished somehow into that more Spacious
Space, whither I now entreat you to conduct me?

Sphere (MOODILY).  They have vanished, certainly--if they ever
appeared.  But most people say that these visions arose from the
thought--you will not understand me--from the brain; from the perturbed
angularity of the Seer.

I.  Say they so?  Oh, believe them not.  Or if it indeed be so, that
this other Space is really Thoughtland, then take me to that blessed
Region where I in Thought shall see the insides of all solid things.
There, before my ravished eye, a Cube moving in some altogether new
direction, but strictly according to Analogy, so as to make every
particle of his interior pass through a new kind of Space, with a wake
of its own--shall create a still more perfect perfection than himself,
with sixteen terminal Extra-solid angles, and Eight solid Cubes for his
Perimeter.  And once there, shall we stay our upward course?  In that
blessed region of Four Dimensions, shall we linger at the threshold of
the Fifth, and not enter therein?  Ah, no!  Let us rather resolve that
our ambition shall soar with our corporal ascent.  Then, yielding to
our intellectual onset, the gates of the Six Dimension shall fly open;
after that a Seventh, and then an Eighth--

How long I should have continued I know not.  In vain did the Sphere,
in his voice of thunder, reiterate his command of silence, and threaten
me with the direst penalties if I persisted.  Nothing could stem the
flood of my ecstatic aspirations.  Perhaps I was to blame; but indeed I
was intoxicated with the recent draughts of Truth to which he himself
had introduced me.  However, the end was not long in coming.  My words
were cut short by a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside me,
which impelled me through space with a velocity that precluded speech.
Down! down! down!  I was rapidly descending; and I knew that return to
Flatland was my doom.  One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten
glimpse I had of that dull level wilderness--which was now to become my
Universe again--spread out before my eye.  Then a darkness.  Then a
final, all-consummating thunder-peal; and, when I came to myself, I was
once more a common creeping Square, in my Study at home, listening to
the Peace-Cry of my approaching Wife.




SECTION 20  How the Sphere encouraged me in a Vision.


Although I had less than a minute for reflection, I felt, by a kind of
instinct, that I must conceal my experiences from my Wife.  Not that I
apprehended, at the moment, any danger from her divulging my secret,
but I knew that to any Woman in Flatland the narrative of my adventures
must needs be unintelligible.  So I endeavoured to reassure her by some
story, invented for the occasion, that I had accidentally fallen
through the trap-door of the cellar, and had there lain stunned.

The Southward attraction in our country is so slight that even to a
Woman my tale necessarily appeared extraordinary and well-nigh
incredible; but my Wife, whose good sense far exceeds that of the
average of her Sex, and who perceived that I was unusually excited, did
not argue with me on the subject, but insisted that I was ill and
required repose.  I was glad of an excuse for retiring to my chamber to
think quietly over what had happened.  When I was at last by myself, a
drowsy sensation fell on me; but before my eyes closed I endeavoured to
reproduce the Third Dimension, and especially the process by which a
Cube is constructed through the motion of a Square.  It was not so
clear as I could have wished; but I remembered that it must be "Upward,
and yet not Northward," and I determined steadfastly to retain these
words as the clue which, if firmly grasped, could not fail to guide me
to the solution.  So mechanically repeating, like a charm, the words,
"Upward, yet not Northward," I fell into a sound refreshing sleep.

During my slumber I had a dream.  I thought I was once more by the side
of the Sphere, whose lustrous hue betokened that he had exchanged his
wrath against me for perfectly placability.  We were moving together
towards a bright but infinitesimally small Point, to which my Master
directed my attention.  As we approached, methought there issued from
it a slight humming noise as from one of your Spaceland bluebottles,
only less resonant by far, so slight indeed that even in the perfect
stillness of the Vacuum through which we soared, the sound reached not
our ears till we checked our flight at a distance from it of something
under twenty human diagonals.

"Look yonder," said my Guide, "in Flatland thou hast lived; of Lineland
thou hast received a vision; thou hast soared with me to the heights of
Spaceland; now, in order to complete the range of thy experience, I
conduct thee downward to the lowest depth of existence, even to the
realm of Pointland, the Abyss of No dimensions.

"Behold yon miserable creature.  That Point is a Being like ourselves,
but confined to the non-dimensional Gulf.  He is himself his own World,
his own Universe; of any other than himself he can form no conception;
he knows not Length, nor Breadth, nor Height, for he has had no
experience of them; he has no cognizance even of the number Two; nor
has he a thought of Plurality; for he is himself his One and All, being
really Nothing.  Yet mark his perfect self-contentment, and hence learn
his lesson, that to be self-contented is to be vile and ignorant, and
that to aspire is better than to be blindly and impotently happy.  Now
listen."

He ceased; and there arose from the little buzzing creature a tiny,
low, monotonous, but distinct tinkling, as from one of your Spaceland
phonographs, from which I caught these words, "Infinite beatitude of
existence!  It is; and there is nothing else beside It."

"What," said I, "does the puny creature mean by 'it'?"  "He means
himself," said the Sphere:  "have you not noticed before now, that
babies and babyish people who cannot distinguish themselves from the
world, speak of themselves in the Third Person?  But hush!"

"It fills all Space," continued the little soliloquizing Creature, "and
what It fills, It is.  What It thinks, that It utters; and what It
utters, that It hears; and It itself is Thinker, Utterer, Hearer,
Thought, Word, Audition; it is the One, and yet the All in All.  Ah,
the happiness, ah, the happiness of Being!"

"Can you not startle the little thing out of its complacency?" said I.
"Tell it what it really is, as you told me; reveal to it the narrow
limitations of Pointland, and lead it up to something higher." "That is
no easy task," said my Master; "try you."

Hereon, raising by voice to the uttermost, I addressed the Point as
follows:

"Silence, silence, contemptible Creature.  You call yourself the All in
All, but you are the Nothing:  your so-called Universe is a mere speck
in a Line, and a Line is a mere shadow as compared with--" "Hush, hush,
you have said enough," interrupted the Sphere, "now listen, and mark
the effect of your harangue on the King of Pointland."

The lustre of the Monarch, who beamed more brightly than ever upon
hearing my words, shewed clearly that he retained his complacency; and
I had hardly ceased when he took up his strain again.  "Ah, the joy,
ah, the joy of Thought!  What can It not achieve by thinking!  Its own
Thought coming to Itself, suggestive of its disparagement, thereby to
enhance Its happiness!  Sweet rebellion stirred up to result in
triumph!  Ah, the divine creative power of the All in One!  Ah, the
joy, the joy of Being!"

"You see," said my Teacher, "how little your words have done.  So far
as the Monarch understand them at all, he accepts them as his own--for
he cannot conceive of any other except himself--and plumes himself upon
the variety of 'Its Thought' as an instance of creative Power.  Let us
leave this God of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his
omnipresence and omniscience:  nothing that you or I can do can rescue
him from his self-satisfaction."

After this, as we floated gently back to Flatland, I could hear the
mild voice of my Companion pointing the moral of my vision, and
stimulating me to aspire, and to teach others to aspire.  He had been
angered at first--he confessed--by my ambition to soar to Dimensions
above the Third; but, since then, he had received fresh insight, and he
was not too proud to acknowledge his error to a Pupil.  Then he
proceeded to initiate me into mysteries yet higher than those I had
witnessed, shewing me how to construct Extra-Solids by the motion of
Solids, and Double Extra-Solids by the motion of Extra-Solids, and all
"strictly according to Analogy," all by methods so simple, so easy, as
to be patent even to the Female Sex.




SECTION 21  How I tried to teach the Theory of Three Dimensions
            to my Grandson, and with what success


I awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before
me.  I would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize the whole of
Flatland.  Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three
Dimensions be proclaimed.  I would begin with my Wife.

Just as I had decided on the plan of my operations, I heard the sound
of many voices in the street commanding silence.  Then followed a
louder voice.  It was a herald's proclamation.  Listening attentively,
I recognized the words of the Resolution of the Council, enjoining the
arrest, imprisonment, or execution of any one who should pervert the
minds of people by delusions, and by professing to have received
revelations from another World.

I reflected.  This danger was not to be trifled with.  It would be
better to avoid it by omitting all mention of my Revelation, and by
proceeding on the path of Demonstration--which after all, seemed so
simple and so conclusive that nothing would be lost by discarding the
former means.  "Upward, not Northward"--was the clue to the whole
proof.  It had seemed to me fairly clear before I fell asleep; and when
I first awoke, fresh from my dream, it had appeared as patent as
Arithmetic; but somehow it did not seem to me quite so obvious now.
Though my Wife entered the room opportunely at just that moment, I
decided, after we had exchanged a few words of commonplace
conversation, not to begin with her.

My Pentagonal Sons were men of character and standing, and physicians
of no mean reputation, but not great in mathematics, and, in that
respect, unfit for my purpose.  But it occurred to me that a young and
docile Hexagon, with a mathematical turn, would be a most suitable
pupil.  Why therefore not make my first experiment with my little
precocious Grandson, whose casual remarks on the meaning of
three-to-the-third had met with the approval of the Sphere?  Discussing
the matter with him, a mere boy, I should be in perfect safety; for he
would know nothing of the Proclamation of the Council; whereas I could
not feel sure that my Sons--so greatly did their patriotism and
reverence for the Circles predominate over mere blind affection--might
not feel compelled to hand me over to the Prefect, if they found me
seriously maintaining the seditious heresy of the Third Dimension.

But the first thing to be done was to satisfy in some way the curiosity
of my Wife, who naturally wished to know something of the reasons for
which the Circle had desired that mysterious interview, and of the
means by which he had entered the house.  Without entering into the
details of the elaborate account I gave her,--an account, I fear, not
quite so consistent with truth as my Readers in Spaceland might
desire,--I must be content with saying that I succeeded at last in
persuading her to return quietly to her household duties without
eliciting from me any reference to the World of Three Dimensions.  This
done, I immediately sent for my Grandson; for, to confess the truth, I
felt that all that I had seen and heard was in some strange way
slipping away from me, like the image of a half-grasped, tantalizing
dream, and I longed to essay my skill in making a first disciple.

When my Grandson entered the room I carefully secured the door.  Then,
sitting down by his side and taking our mathematical tablets,--or, as
you would call them, Lines--I told him we would resume the lesson of
yesterday.  I taught him once more how a Point by motion in One
Dimension produces a Line, and how a straight Line in Two Dimensions
produces a Square.  After this, forcing a laugh, I said, "And now, you
scamp, you wanted to make believe that a Square may in the same way by
motion 'Upward, not Northward' produce another figure, a sort of extra
square in Three Dimensions.  Say that again, you young rascal."

At this moment we heard once more the herald's "O yes! O yes!" outside
in the street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council.  Young though
he was, my Grandson--who was unusually intelligent for his age, and
bred up in perfect reverence for the authority of the Circles--took in
the situation with an acuteness for which I was quite unprepared.  He
remained silent till the last words of the Proclamation had died away,
and then, bursting into tears, "Dear Grandpapa," he said, "that was
only my fun, and of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not
know anything then about the new Law; and I don't think I said anything
about the Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about
'Upward, not Northward,' for that would be such nonsense, you know.
How could a thing move Upward, and not Northward?  Upward and not
Northward!  Even if I were a baby, I could not be so absurd as that.
How silly it is!  Ha! ha! ha!"

"Not at all silly," said I, losing my temper; "here for example, I take
this Square," and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square, which was
lying at hand--"and I move it, you see, not Northward but--yes, I move
it Upward--that is to say, Northward but I move it somewhere--not
exactly like this, but somehow--"  Here I brought my sentence to an
inane conclusion, shaking the Square about in a purposeless manner,
much to the amusement of my Grandson, who burst out laughing louder
than ever, and declared that I was not teaching him, but joking with
him; and so saying he unlocked the door and ran out of the room.  Thus
ended my first attempt to convert a pupil to the Gospel of Three
Dimensions.




SECTION 22  How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three
            Dimensions by other means, and of the result


My failure with my Grandson did not encourage me to communicate my
secret to others of my household; yet neither was I led by it to
despair of success.  Only I saw that I must not wholly rely on the
catch-phrase, "Upward, not Northward," but must rather endeavour to
seek a demonstration by setting before the public a clear view of the
whole subject; and for this purpose it seemed necessary to resort to
writing.

So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition of a treatise
on the mysteries of Three Dimensions.  Only, with the view of evading
the Law, if possible, I spoke not of a physical Dimension, but of a
Thoughtland whence, in theory, a Figure could look down upon Flatland
and see simultaneously the insides of all things, and where it was
possible that there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed, as
it were, with six Squares, and containing eight terminal Points.  But
in writing this book I found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility
of drawing such diagrams as were necessary for my purpose:  for of
course, in our country of Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines, and
no diagrams but Lines, all in one straight Line and only
distinguishable by difference of size and brightness; so that, when I
had finished my treatise (which I entitled, "Through Flatland to
Thoughtland") I could not feel certain that many would understand my
meaning.

Meanwhile my wife was under a cloud.  All pleasures palled upon me; all
sights tantalized and tempted me to outspoken treason, because I could
not compare what I saw in Two Dimensions with what it really was if
seen in Three, and could hardly refrain from making my comparisons
aloud.  I neglected my clients and my own business to give myself to
the contemplation of the mysteries which I had once beheld, yet which I
could impart to no one, and found daily more difficult to reproduce
even before my own mental vision.  One day, about eleven months after
my return from Spaceland, I tried to see a Cube with my eye closed, but
failed; and though I succeeded afterwards, I was not then quite certain
(nor have I been ever afterwards) that I had exactly realized the
original.  This made me more melancholy than before, and determined me
to take some step; yet what, I knew not.  I felt that I would have been
willing to sacrifice my life for the Cause, if thereby I could have
produced conviction.  But if I could not convince my Grandson, how
could I convince the highest and most developed Circles in the land?

And yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent to
dangerous utterances.  Already I was considered heterodox if not
treasonable, and I was keenly alive to the danger of my position;
nevertheless I could not at times refrain from bursting out into
suspicious or half-seditious utterances, even among the highest
Polygonal or Circular society.  When, for example, the question arose
about the treatment of those lunatics who said that they had received
the power of seeing the insides of things, I would quote the saying of
an ancient Circle, who declared that prophets and inspired people are
always considered by the majority to be mad; and I could not help
occasionally dropping such expressions as "the eye that discerns the
interiors of things," and "the all-seeing land"; once or twice I even
let fall the forbidden terms "the Third and Fourth Dimensions." At
last, to complete a series of minor indiscretions, at a meeting of our
Local Speculative Society held at the palace of the Prefect
himself,--some extremely silly person having read an elaborate paper
exhibiting the precise reasons why Providence has limited the number of
Dimensions to Two, and why the attribute of omnividence is assigned to
the Supreme alone--I so far forgot myself as to give an exact account
of the whole of my voyage with the Sphere into Space, and to the
Assembly Hall in our Metropolis, and then to Space again, and of my
return home, and of everything that I had seen and heard in fact or
vision.  At first, indeed, I pretended that I was describing the
imaginary experiences of a fictitious person; but my enthusiasm soon
forced me to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a fervent
peroration, I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of prejudice
and to become believers in the Third Dimension.

Need I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?

Next morning, standing in the very place where but a very few months
ago the Sphere had stood in my company, I was allowed to begin and to
continue my narration unquestioned and uninterrupted.  But from the
first I foresaw my fate; for the President, noting that a guard of the
better sort of Policemen was in attendance, of angularity little, if at
all, under 55 degrees, ordered them to be relieved before I began my
defence, by an inferior class of 2 or 3 degrees.  I knew only too well
what that meant.  I was to be executed or imprisoned, and my story was
to be kept secret from the world by the simultaneous destruction of the
officials who had heard it; and, this being the case, the President
desired to substitute the cheaper for the more expensive victims.

After I had concluded my defence, the President, perhaps perceiving
that some of the junior Circles had been moved by evident earnestness,
asked me two questions:--

1.  Whether I could indicate the direction which I meant when I used
the words "Upward, not Northward"?

2.  Whether I could by any diagrams or descriptions (other than the
enumeration of imaginary sides and angles) indicate the Figure I was
pleased to call a Cube?

I declared that I could say nothing more, and that I must commit myself
to the Truth, whose cause would surely prevail in the end.

The President replied that he quite concurred in my sentiment, and that
I could not do better.  I must be sentenced to perpetual imprisonment;
but if the Truth intended that I should emerge from prison and
evangelize the world, the Truth might be trusted to bring that result
to pass.  Meanwhile I should be subjected to no discomfort that was not
necessary to preclude escape, and, unless I forfeited the privilege by
misconduct, I should be occasionally permitted to see my brother who
had preceded me to my prison.

Seven years have elapsed and I am still a prisoner, and--if I except
the occasional visits of my brother--debarred from all companionship
save that of my jailers.  My brother is one of the best of Squares,
just, sensible, cheerful, and not without fraternal affection; yet I
confess that my weekly interviews, at least in one respect, cause me
the bitterest pain.  He was present when the Sphere manifested himself
in the Council Chamber; he saw the Sphere's changing sections; he heard
the explanation of the phenomena then give to the Circles.  Since that
time, scarcely a week has passed during seven whole years, without his
hearing from me a repetition of the part I played in that
manifestation, together with ample descriptions of all the phenomena in
Spaceland, and the arguments for the existence of Solid things
derivable from Analogy.  Yet--I take shame to be forced to confess
it--my brother has not yet grasped the nature of Three Dimensions, and
frankly avows his disbelief in the existence of a Sphere.

Hence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that I can
see, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing.
Prometheus up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire for
mortals, but I--poor Flatland Prometheus--lie here in prison for
bringing down nothing to my countrymen.  Yet I existing the hope that
these memoirs, in some manner, I know not how, may find their way to
the minds of humanity in Some Dimension, and may stir up a race of
rebels who shall refuse to be confined to limited Dimensionality.

That is the hope of my brighter moments.  Alas, it is not always so.
Heavily weights on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot
honestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen,
oft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept,
"Upward, not Northward," haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx.  It is
part of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of Truth that there
are seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres flit away into
the background of scarce-possible existences; when the Land of Three
Dimensions seems almost as visionary as the Land of One or None; nay,
when even this hard wall that bars me from my freedom, these very
tablets on which I am writing, and all the substantial realities of
Flatland itself, appear no better than the offspring of a diseased
imagination, or the baseless fabric of a dream.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND REVISED EDITION, 1884.  BY THE EDITOR


If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed
when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to
represent him in this preface, in which he desires, fully, to return
his thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland, whose appreciation
has, with unexpected celerity, required a second edition of this work;
secondly, to apologize for certain errors and misprints (for which,
however, he is not entirely responsible); and, thirdly, to explain one
or two misconceptions.  But he is not the Square he once was.  Years of
imprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general incredulity and
mockery, have combined with the thoughts and notions, and much also of
the terminology, which he acquired during his short stay in spaceland.
He has, therefore, requested me to reply in his behalf to two special
objections, one of an intellectual, the other of a moral nature.

The first objection is, that a Flatlander, seeing a Line, sees
something that must be THICK to the eye as well as LONG to the eye
(otherwise it would not be visible, if it had not some thickness); and
consequently he ought (it is argued) to acknowledge that his countrymen
are not only long and broad, but also (though doubtless to a very
slight degree) THICK or HIGH.  This objection is plausible, and, to
Spacelanders, almost irresistible, so that, I confess, when I first
heard it, I knew not what to reply.  But my poor old friend's answer
appears to me completely to meet it.

"I admit," said he--when I mentioned to him this objection--"I admit
the truth of your critic's facts, but I deny his conclusions.  It is
true that we have really in Flatland a Third unrecognized Dimension
called 'height,' just as it also is true that you have really in
Spaceland a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, called by no name at
present, but which I will call 'extra-height.'  But we can no more take
cognizance of our 'height' than you can of your 'extra-height.'  Even
I--who have been in Spaceland, and have had the privilege of
understanding for twenty-four hours the meaning of 'height'--even I
cannot now comprehend it, nor realize it by the sense of sight or by
any process of reason; I can but apprehend it by faith.

"The reason is obvious.  Dimension implies direction, implies
measurement, implies the more and the less.  Now, all our lines are
EQUALLY and INFINITESIMALLY thick (or high, whichever you like);
consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the
conception of that Dimension.  No 'delicate micrometer'--as has been
suggested by one too hasty Spaceland critic--would in the least avail
us; for we should not know WHAT TO MEASURE, NOR IN WHAT DIRECTION.
When we see a Line, we see something that is long and BRIGHT;
BRIGHTNESS, as well as length, is necessary to the existence of a Line;
if the brightness vanishes, the Line is extinguished.  Hence, all my
Flatland friends--when I talk to them about the unrecognized Dimension
which is somehow visible in a Line--say, 'Ah, you mean BRIGHTNESS': and
when I reply, 'No, I mean a real Dimension,' they at once retort, 'Then
measure it, or tell us in what direction it extends'; and this silences
me, for I can do neither.  Only yesterday, when the Chief Circle (in
other words our High Priest) came to inspect the State Prison and paid
me his seventh annual visit, and when for the seventh time he put me
the question, 'Was I any better?'  I tried to prove to him that he was
'high,' as well as long and broad, although he did not know it.  But
what was his reply?  'You say I am "high"; measure my "high-ness" and I
will believe you.'  What could I do?  How could I meet his challenge?
I was crushed; and he left the room triumphant.

"Does this still seem strange to you?  Then put yourself in a similar
position.  Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension, condescending to
visit you, were to say, 'Whenever you open your eyes, you see a Plane
(which is of Two Dimensions) and you INFER a Solid (which is of Three);
but in reality you also see (though you do not recognize) a Fourth
Dimension, which is not colour nor brightness nor anything of the kind,
but a true Dimension, although I cannot point out to you its direction,
nor can you possibly measure it.' What would you say to such a visitor?
Would not you have him locked up?  Well, that is my fate:  and it is as
natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for preaching the Third
Dimension, as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube for
preaching the Fourth.  Alas, how strong a family likeness runs through
blind and persecuting humanity in all Dimensions!  Points, Lines,
Squares, Cubes, Extra-Cubes--we are all liable to the same errors, all
alike the Slaves of our respective Dimensional prejudices, as one of
our Spaceland poets has said--


     'One touch of Nature makes all worlds akin.'" (footnote 1)


On this point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable.
I wish I could say that his answer to the second (or moral) objection
was equally clear and cogent.  It has been objected that he is a
woman-hater; and as this objection has been vehemently urged by those
whom Nature's decree has constituted the somewhat larger half of the
Spaceland race, I should like to remove it, so far as I can honestly do
so.  But the Square is so unaccustomed to the use of the moral
terminology of Spaceland that I should be doing him an injustice if I
were literally to transcribe his defence against this charge.  Acting,
therefore, as his interpreter and summarizer, I gather that in the
course of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modified his
own personal views, both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles
or Lower Classes.  Personally, he now inclines to the opinion of the
Sphere (see page 86) that the Straight Lines are in many important
respects superior to the Circles.  But, writing as a Historian, he has
identified himself (perhaps too closely) with the views generally
adopted by Flatland, and (as he has been informed) even by Spaceland,
Historians; in whose pages (until very recent times) the destinies of
Women and of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of
mention and never of careful consideration.

In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow the Circular
or aristocratic tendencies with which some critics have naturally
credited him.  While doing justice to the intellectual power with which
a few Circles have for many generations maintained their supremacy over
immense multitudes of their countrymen, he believes that the facts of
Flatland, speaking for themselves without comment on his part, declare
that Revolutions cannot always be suppressed by slaughter, and that
Nature, in sentencing the Circles to infecundity, has condemned them to
ultimate failure--"and herein," he says, "I see a fulfilment of the
great Law of all worlds, that while the wisdom of Man thinks it is
working one thing, the wisdom of Nature constrains it to work another,
and quite a different and far better thing." For the rest, he begs his
readers not to suppose that every minute detail in the daily life of
Flatland must needs correspond to some other detail in Spaceland; and
yet he hopes that, taken as a whole, his work may prove suggestive as
well as amusing, to those Spacelanders of moderate and modest minds
who--speaking of that which is of the highest importance, but lies
beyond experience--decline to say on the one hand, "This can never be,"
and on the other hand, "It must needs be precisely thus, and we know
all about it."


Footnote 1.  The Author desires me to add, that the misconceptions of
some of his critics on this matter has induced him to insert (on pp.
74 and 92) in his dialogue with the Sphere, certain remarks which have
a bearing on the point in question and which he had previously omitted
as being tedious and unnecessary.


The subject matter of this book was first broached in the brain
of Leibniz, who, in the dissertation, written in his twenty-third year,
on the mode of electing the kings of Poland, conceived of Probability
as a branch of Logic. A few years before, “un problème,” in the
words of Poisson, “proposé à un austère janséniste par un homme du
monde, a été l’origine du calcul des probabilitiés.” In the intervening
centuries the algebraical exercises, in which the Chevalier de la Méré
interested Pascal, have so far predominated in the learned world over
the profounder enquiries of the philosopher into those processes of
human faculty which, by determining reasonable preference, guide our
choice, that Probability is oftener reckoned with Mathematics than
with Logic. There is much here, therefore, which is novel and, being
novel, unsifted, inaccurate, or deficient. I propound my systematic
conception of this subject for criticism and enlargement at the hand
of others, doubtful whether I myself am likely to get much further,
by waiting longer, with a work, which, beginning as a Fellowship
Dissertation, and interrupted by the war, has already extended over
many years.
It may be perceived that I have been much influenced by W. E.
Johnson, G. E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell, that is to say by
Cambridge, which, with great debts to the writers of Continental
Europe, yet continues in direct succession the English tradition of
Locke and Berkeley and Hume, of Mill and Sidgwick, who, in spite of
their divergences of doctrine, are united in a preference for what is
matter of fact, and have conceived their subject as a branch rather of
science than of the creative imagination, prose writers, hoping to be
understood.

CHAPTER I
the meaning of probability
“J’ai dit plus d’une fois qu’il faudrait une nouvelle espèce de logique, qui
traiteroit des degrés de Probabilité.”—Leibniz.
1. Part of our knowledge we obtain direct; and part by
argument. The Theory of Probability is concerned with that part
which we obtain by argument, and it treats of the different degrees in
which the results so obtained are conclusive or inconclusive.
In most branches of academic logic, such as the theory of the
syllogism or the geometry of ideal space, all the arguments aim at
demonstrative certainty. They claim to be conclusive. But many other
arguments are rational and claim some weight without pretending to
be certain. In Metaphysics, in Science, and in Conduct, most of the
arguments, upon which we habitually base our rational beliefs, are
admitted to be inconclusive in a greater or less degree. Thus for a
philosophical treatment of these branches of knowledge, the study of
probability is required.
The course which the history of thought has led Logic to follow
has encouraged the view that doubtful arguments are not within
its scope. But in the actual exercise of reason we do not wait on
certainty, or doom it irrational to depend on a doubtful argument. If
logic investigates the general principles of valid thought, the study of
arguments, to which it is rational to attach some weight, is as much
a part of it as the study of those which are demonstrative.
2. The terms certain and probable describe the various degrees
of rational belief about a proposition which different amounts of
knowledge authorise us to entertain. All propositions are true or false,
but the knowledge we have of them depends on our circumstances;
and while it is often convenient to speak of propositions as certain or
probable, this expresses strictly a relationship in which they stand to
a corpus of knowledge, actual or hypothetical, and not a characteristic
2
ch. i FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 3
of the propositions in themselves. A proposition is capable at the
same time of varying degrees of this relationship, depending upon the
knowledge to which it is related, so that it is without significance to
call a proposition probable unless we specify the knowledge to which
we are relating it.
To this extent, therefore, probability may be called subjective.
But in the sense important to logic, probability is not subjective. It
is not, that is to say, subject to human caprice. A proposition is not
probable because we think it so. When once the facts are given which
determine our knowledge, what is probable or improbable in these
circumstances has been fixed objectively, and is independent of our
opinion. The Theory of Probability is logical, therefore, because it is
concerned with the degree of belief which it is rational to entertain in
given conditions, and not merely with the actual beliefs of particular
individuals, which may or may not be rational.
Given the body of direct knowledge which constitutes our ultimate
premisses, this theory tells us what further rational beliefs, certain or
probable, can be derived by valid argument from our direct knowledge.
This involves purely logical relations between the propositions which
embody our direct knowledge and the propositions about which we
seek indirect knowledge. What particular propositions we select as
the premisses of our argument naturally depends on subjective factors
peculiar to ourselves; but the relations, in which other propositions
stand to these, and which entitle us to probable beliefs, are objective
and logical.
3. Let our premisses consist of any set of propositions h, and our
conclusion consist of any set of propositions a, then, if a knowledge
of h justifies a rational belief in a of degree a, we say that there is a
probability-relation of degree a between a and h.
*
In ordinary speech we often describe the conclusion as being
doubtful, uncertain, or only probable. But, strictly, these terms
*This will be written a/h = a.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 4
ought to be applied, either to the degree of our rational belief in
the conclusion, or to the relation or argument between two sets
of propositions, knowledge of which would afford grounds for a
corresponding degree of rational belief.*
4. With the term “event,” which has taken hitherto so important
a place in the phraseology of the subject, I shall dispense altogether.†
Writers on Probability have generally dealt with what they term the
“happening” of “events.” In the problems which they first studied
this did not involve much departure from common usage. But these
expressions are now used in a way which is vague and ambiguous;
and it will be more than a verbal improvement to discuss the truth
and the probability of propositions instead of the occurrence and the
probability of events.
‡
5. These general ideas are not likely to provoke much criticism.
In the ordinary course of thought and argument, we are constantly
assuming that knowledge of one statement, while not proving the
truth of a second, yields nevertheless some ground for believing it.
We assert that we ought on the evidence to prefer such and such
a belief. We claim rational grounds for assertions which are not
conclusively demonstrated. We allow, in fact, that statements may
be unproved, without, for that reason, being unfounded. And it
does not seem on reflection that the information we convey by these
expressions is wholly subjective. When we argue that Darwin gives
valid grounds for our accepting his theory of natural selection, we do
not simply mean that we are psychologically inclined to agree with
*See also Chapter II. § 5.
†Except in those chapters (Chap. XVII., for example) where I am dealing
chiefly with the work of others.
‡The first writer I know of to notice this was Ancillon in Doutes sur les
bases du calcul des probabilités (1794): “Dire qu’un fait passé, présent ou à
venir est probable, c’est dire qu’une proposition est probable.” The point was
emphasised by Boole, Laws of Thought, pp. 7 and 167. See also Czuber,
Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, vol. i. p. 5, and Stumpf, Über den Begriff der
mathematischen Wahrscheinlichkeit.
ch. i FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 5
him; it is certain that we also intend to convey our belief that we are
acting rationally in regarding his theory as probable. We believe that
there is some real objective relation between Darwin’s evidence and
his conclusions, which is independent of the mere fact of our belief,
and which is just as real and objective, though of a different degree,
as that which would exist if the argument were as demonstrative as
a syllogism. We are claiming, in fact, to cognise correctly a logical
connection between one set of propositions which we call our evidence
and which we suppose ourselves to know, and another set which we
call our conclusions, and to which we attach more or less weight
according to the grounds supplied by the first. It is this type of
objective relation between sets of propositions—the type which we
claim to be correctly perceiving when we make such assertions as
these—to which the reader’s attention must be directed.
6. It is not straining the use of words to speak of this as the
relation of probability. It is true that mathematicians have employed
the term in a narrower sense; for they have often confined it to
the limited class of instances in which the relation is adapted to an
algebraical treatment. But in common usage the word has never
received this limitation.
Students of probability in the sense which is meant by the authors
of typical treatises on Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung or Calcul des
probabilités, will find that I do eventually reach topics with which
they are familiar. But in making a serious attempt to deal with
the fundamental difficulties with which all students of mathematical
probabilities have met and which are notoriously unsolved, we must
begin at the beginning (or almost at the beginning) and treat our
subject widely. As soon as mathematical probability ceases to be
the merest algebra or pretends to guide our decisions, it immediately
meets with problems against which its own weapons are quite
powerless. And even if we wish later on to use probability in a narrow
sense, it will be well to know first what it means in the widest.
7. Between two sets of propositions, therefore, there exists
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 6
a relation, in virtue of which, if we know the first, we can attach
to the latter some degree of rational belief. This relation is the
subject-matter of the logic of probability.
A great deal of confusion and error has arisen out of a failure to
take due account of this relational aspect of probability. From the
premisses “a implies b” and “a is true,” we can conclude something
about b—namely that b is true—which does not involve a. But, if a
is so related to b, that a knowledge of it renders a probable belief in b
rational, we cannot conclude anything whatever about b which has
not reference to a; and it is not true that every set of self-consistent
premisses which includes a has this same relation to b. It is as useless,
therefore, to say “b is probable” as it would be to say “b is equal,”
or “b is greater than,” and as unwarranted to conclude that, because
a makes b probable, therefore a and c together make b probable, as
to argue that because a is less than b, therefore a and c together are
less than b.
Thus, when in ordinary speech we name some opinion as probable
without further qualification, the phrase is generally elliptical. We
mean that it is probable when certain considerations, implicitly or
explicitly present to our minds at the moment, are taken into account.
We use the word for the sake of shortness, just as we speak of a place
as being three miles distant, when we mean three miles distant from
where we are then situated, or from some starting-point to which we
tacitly refer. No proposition is in itself either probable or improbable,
just as no place can be intrinsically distant; and the probability of
the same statement varies with the evidence presented, which is, as
it were, its origin of reference. We may fix our attention on our own
knowledge and, treating this as our origin, consider the probabilities
of all other suppositions,—according to the usual practice which leads
to the elliptical form of common speech; or we may, equally well, fix it
on a proposed conclusion and consider what degree of probability this
would derive from various sets of assumptions, which might constitute
the corpus of knowledge of ourselves or others, or which are merely
ch. i FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 7
hypotheses.
Reflection will show that this account harmonises with familiar
experience. There is nothing novel in the supposition that the
probability of a theory turns upon the evidence by which it is
supported; and it is common to assert that an opinion was probable
on the evidence at first to hand, but on further information was
untenable. As our knowledge or our hypothesis changes, our
conclusions have new probabilities, not in themselves, but relatively
to these new premisses. New logical relations have now become
important, namely those between the conclusions which we are
investigating and our new assumptions; but the old relations between
the conclusions and the former assumptions still exist and are just
as real as these new ones. It would be as absurd to deny that an
opinion was probable, when at a later stage certain objections have
come to light, as to deny, when we have reached our destination, that
it was ever three miles distant; and the opinion still is probable in
relation to the old hypotheses, just as the destination is still three
miles distant from our starting-point.
8. A definition of probability is not possible, unless it contents us
to define degrees of the probability-relation by reference to degrees of
rational belief. We cannot analyse the probability-relation in terms of
simpler ideas. As soon as we have passed from the logic of implication
and the categories of truth and falsehood to the logic of probability
and the categories of knowledge, ignorance, and rational belief, we
are paying attention to a new logical relation in which, although it
is logical, we were not previously interested, and which cannot be
explained or defined in terms of our previous notions.
This opinion is, from the nature of the case, incapable of positive
proof. The presumption in its favour must arise partly out of our
failure to find a definition, and partly because the notion presents
itself to the mind as something new and independent. If the statement
that an opinion was probable on the evidence at first to hand, but
became untenable on further information, is not solely concerned with
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 8
psychological belief, I do not know how the element of logical doubt
is to be defined, or how its substance is to be stated, in terms of the
other indefinables of formal logic. The attempts at definition, which
have been made hitherto, will be criticised in later chapters. I do not
believe that any of them accurately represent that particular logical
relation which we have in our minds when we speak of the probability
of an argument.
In the great majority of cases the term “probable” seems to be
used consistently by different persons to describe the same concept.
Differences of opinion have not been due, I think, to a radical
ambiguity of language. In any case a desire to reduce the indefinables
of logic can easily be carried too far. Even if a definition is
discoverable in the end, there is no harm in postponing it until our
enquiry into the object of definition is far advanced. In the case of
“probability” the object before the mind is so familiar that the danger
of misdescribing its qualities through lack of a definition is less than if
it were a highly abstract entity far removed from the normal channels
of thought.
9. This chapter has served briefly to indicate, though not
to define, the subject matter of the book. Its object has been
to emphasise the existence of a logical relation between two sets of
propositions in cases where it is not possible to argue demonstratively
from one to the other. This is a contention of a most fundamental
character. It is not entirely novel, but has seldom received due
emphasis, is often overlooked, and sometimes denied. The view, that
probability arises out of the existence of a specific relation between
premiss and conclusion, depends for its acceptance upon a reflective
judgment on the true character of the concept. It will be our object
to discuss, under the title of Probability, the principal properties of
this relation. First, however, we must digress in order to consider
briefly what we mean by knowledge, rational belief, and argument.
CHAPTER II
probability in relation to the theory of
knowledge
1. I do not wish to become involved in questions of epistemology
to which I do not know the answer; and I am anxious to reach as
soon as possible the particular part of philosophy or logic which is the
subject of this book. But some explanation is necessary if the reader
is to be put in a position to understand the point of view from which
the author sets out; I will, therefore, expand some part of what has
been outlined or assumed in the first chapter.
2. There is, first of all, the distinction between that part of
our belief which is rational and that part which is not. If a man
believes something for a reason which is preposterous or for no reason
at all, and what he believes turns out to be true for some reason not
known to him, he cannot be said to believe it rationally, although he
believes it and it is in fact true. On the other hand, a man may
rationally believe a proposition to be probable, when it is in fact false.
The distinction between rational belief and mere belief, therefore, is
not the same as the distinction between true beliefs and false beliefs.
The highest degree of rational belief, which is termed certain rational
belief, corresponds to knowledge. We may be said to know a thing
when we have a certain rational belief in it, and vice versa. For
reasons which will appear from our account of probable degrees of
rational belief in the following paragraph, it is preferable to regard
knowledge as fundamental and to define rational belief by reference
to it.
3. We come next to the distinction between that part of our
rational belief which is certain and that part which is only probable.
Belief, whether rational or not, is capable of degree. The highest
degree of rational belief, or rational certainty of belief, and its relation
to knowledge have been introduced above. What, however, is the
9
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 10
relation to knowledge of probable degrees of rational belief?
The proposition (say, q) that we know in this case is not the
same as the proposition (say, p) in which we have a probable degree
(say, a) of rational belief. If the evidence upon which we base our
belief is h, then what we know, namely q, is that the proposition p
bears the probability-relation of degree a to the set of propositions h;
and this knowledge of ours justifies us in a rational belief of degree a
in the proposition p. It will be convenient to call propositions such
as p, which do not contain assertions about probability-relations,
“primary propositions”; and propositions such as q, which assert the
existence of a probability-relation, “secondary propositions.” *
4. Thus knowledge of a proposition always corresponds to
certainty of rational belief in it and at the same time to actual truth
in the proposition itself. We cannot know a proposition unless it is
in fact true. A probable degree of rational belief in a proposition,
on the other hand, arises out of knowledge of some corresponding
secondary proposition. A man may rationally believe a proposition to
be probable when it is in fact false, if the secondary proposition on
which he depends is true and certain; while a man cannot rationally
believe a proposition to be probable even when it is in fact true, if
the secondary proposition on which he depends is not true. Thus
rational belief of whatever degree can only arise out of knowledge,
although the knowledge may be of a proposition secondary, in the
above sense, to the proposition in which the rational degree of belief
is entertained.
5. At this point it is desirable to colligate the three senses in
which the term probability has been so far employed. In its most
fundamental sense, I think, it refers to the logical relation between
two sets of propositions, which in § 4 of Chapter I. I have termed the
probability-relation. It is with this that I shall be mainly concerned
in the greater part of this Treatise. Derivative from this sense, we
*This classification of “primary” and “secondary” propositions was suggested
to me by Mr. W. E. Johnson.
ch. ii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 11
have the sense in which, as above, the term probable is applied to
the degrees of rational belief arising out of knowledge of secondary
propositions which assert the existence of probability-relations in the
fundamental logical sense. Further it is often convenient, and not
necessarily misleading, to apply the term probable to the proposition
which is the object of the probable degree of rational belief, and
which bears the probability-relation in question to the propositions
comprising the evidence.
6. I turn now to the distinction between direct and indirect
knowledge—between that part of our rational belief which we know
directly and that part which we know by argument.
We start from things, of various classes, with which we have,
what I choose to call without reference to other uses of this term,
direct acquaintance. Acquaintance with such things does not in itself
constitute knowledge, although knowledge arises out of acquaintance
with them. The most important classes of things with which we
have direct acquaintance are our own sensations, which we may be
said to experience, the ideas or meanings, about which we have
thoughts and which we may be said to understand, and facts or
characteristics or relations of sense-data or meanings, which we may
be said to perceive;—experience, understanding, and perception being
three forms of direct acquaintance.
The objects of knowledge and belief—as opposed to the objects
of direct acquaintance which I term sensations, meanings, and
perceptions—I shall term propositions.
Now our knowledge of propositions seems to be obtained in
two ways: directly, as the result of contemplating the objects
of acquaintance; and indirectly, by argument, through perceiving
the probability-relation of the proposition, about which we seek
knowledge, to other propositions. In the second case, at any rate
at first, what we know is not the proposition itself but a secondary
proposition involving it. When we know a secondary proposition
involving the proposition p as subject, we may be said to have indirect
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 12
knowledge about p.
Indirect knowledge about p may in suitable conditions lead to
rational belief in p of an appropriate degree. If this degree is that of
certainty, then we have not merely indirect knowledge about p, but
indirect knowledge of p.
7. Let us take examples of direct knowledge. From acquaintance
with a sensation of yellow I can pass directly to a knowledge of the
proposition “I have a sensation of yellow.” From acquaintance with
a sensation of yellow and with the meanings of “yellow,” “colour,”
“existence,” I may be able to pass to a direct knowledge of the
propositions “I understand the meaning of yellow,” “my sensation of
yellow exists,” “yellow is a colour.” Thus, by some mental process
of which it is difficult to give an account, we are able to pass from
direct acquaintance with things to a knowledge of propositions about
the things of which we have sensations or understand the meaning.
Next, by the contemplation of propositions of which we have direct
knowledge, we are able to pass indirectly to knowledge of or about
other propositions. The mental process by which we pass from direct
knowledge to indirect knowledge is in some cases and in some degree
capable of analysis. We pass from a knowledge of the proposition a to
a knowledge about the proposition b by perceiving a logical relation
between them. With this logical relation we have direct acquaintance.
The logic of knowledge is mainly occupied with a study of the logical
relations, direct acquaintance with which permits direct knowledge
of the secondary proposition asserting the probability-relation, and
so to indirect knowledge about, and in some cases of, the primary
proposition.
It is not always possible, however, to analyse the mental process
in the case of indirect knowledge, or to say by the perception of what
logical relation we have passed from the knowledge of one proposition
to knowledge about another. But although in some cases we seem to
pass directly from one proposition to another, I am inclined to believe
that in all legitimate transitions of this kind some logical relation
ch. ii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 13
of the proper kind must exist between the propositions, even when
we are not explicitly aware of it. In any case, whenever we pass to
knowledge about one proposition by the contemplation of it in relation
to another proposition of which we have knowledge—even when the
process is unanalysable—I call it an argument. The knowledge, such
as we have in ordinary thought by passing from one proposition to
another without being able to say what logical relations, if any, we
have perceived between them, may be termed uncompleted knowledge.
And knowledge, which results from a distinct apprehension of the
relevant logical relations, may be termed knowledge proper.
8. In this way, therefore, I distinguish between direct and
indirect knowledge, between that part of our rational belief which is
based on direct knowledge and that part which is based on argument.
About what kinds of things we are capable of knowing propositions
directly, it is not easy to say. About our own existence, our own
sense-data, some logical ideas, and some logical relations, it is usually
agreed that we have direct knowledge. Of the law of gravity, of the
appearance of the other side of the moon, of the cure for phthisis,
of the contents of Bradshaw, it is usually agreed that we do not
have direct knowledge. But many questions are in doubt. Of which
logical ideas and relations we have direct acquaintance, as to whether
we can ever know directly the existence of other people, and as
to when we are knowing propositions about sense-data directly and
when we are interpreting them—it is not possible to give a clear
answer. Moreover, there is another and peculiar kind of derivative
knowledge—by memory.
At a given moment there is a great deal of our knowledge which
we know neither directly nor by argument—we remember it. We
may remember it as knowledge, but forget how we originally knew
it. What we once knew and now consciously remember, can fairly
be called knowledge. But it is not easy to draw the line between
conscious memory, unconscious memory or habit, and pure instinct
or irrational associations of ideas (acquired or inherited)—the last of
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 14
which cannot fairly be called knowledge, for unlike the first two it did
not even arise (in us at least) out of knowledge. Especially in such
a case as that of what our eyes tell us, it is difficult to distinguish
between the different ways in which our beliefs have arisen. We
cannot always tell, therefore, what is remembered knowledge and
what is not knowledge at all; and when knowledge is remembered, we
do not always remember at the same time whether, originally, it was
direct or indirect.
Although it is with knowledge by argument that I shall be mainly
concerned in this book there is one kind of direct knowledge, namely
of secondary propositions, with which I cannot help but be involved.
In the case of every argument, it is only directly that we can know
the secondary proposition which makes the argument itself valid and
rational. When we know something by argument this must be through
direct acquaintance with some logical relation between the conclusion
and the premiss. In all knowledge, therefore, there is some direct
element; and logic can never be made purely mechanical. All it can
do is so to arrange the reasoning that the logical relations, which have
to be perceived directly, are made explicit and are of a simple kind.
9. It must be added that the term certainty is sometimes used
in a merely psychological sense to describe a state of mind without
reference to the logical grounds of the belief. With this sense I am not
concerned. It is also used to describe the highest degree of rational
belief; and this is the sense relevant to our present purpose. The
peculiarity of certainty is that knowledge of a secondary proposition
involving certainty, together with knowledge of what stands in this
secondary proposition in the position of evidence, leads to knowledge
of, and not merely about, the corresponding primary proposition.
Knowledge, on the other hand, of a secondary proposition involving
a degree of probability lower than certainty, together with knowledge
of the premiss of the secondary proposition, leads only to a rational
belief of the appropriate degree in the primary proposition. The
knowledge present in this latter case I have called knowledge about
ch. ii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 15
the primary proposition or conclusion of the argument, as distinct
from knowledge of it.
Of probability we can say no more than that it is a lower degree
of rational belief than certainty; and we may say, if we like, that
it deals with degrees of certainty.* Or we may make probability
the more fundamental of the two and regard certainty as a special
case of probability, as being, in fact, the maximum probability.
Speaking somewhat loosely we may say that, if our premisses make
the conclusion certain, then it follows from the premisses; and if they
make it very probable, then it very nearly follows from them.
It is sometimes useful to use the term “impossibility” as the
negative correlative of “certainty,” although the former sometimes has
a different set of associations. If a is certain, then the contradictory
of a is impossible. If a knowledge of a makes b certain, then a
knowledge of a makes the contradictory of b impossible. Thus a
proposition is impossible with respect to a given premiss, if it is
disproved by the premiss; and the relation of impossibility is the
relation of minimum probability.†
10. We have distinguished between rational belief and irrational
belief and also between rational beliefs which are certain in degree
and those which are only probable. Knowledge has been distinguished
according as it is direct or indirect, according as it is of primary or
*This view has often been taken, e.g., by Bernoulli and, incidentally, by
Laplace; also by Fries (see Czuber, Entwicklung, p. 12). The view, occasionally
held, that probability is concerned with degrees of truth, arises out of a
confusion between certainty and truth. Perhaps the Aristotelian doctrine that
future events are neither true nor false arose in this way.
†Necessity and Impossibility, in the senses in which these terms are used in
the theory of Modality, seem to correspond to the relations of Certainty and
Impossibility in the theory of probability, the other modals, which comprise the
intermediate degrees of possibility, corresponding to the intermediate degrees of
probability. Almost up to the end of the seventeenth century the traditional
treatment of modals is, in fact, a primitive attempt to bring the relations of
probability within the scope of formal logic.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 16
secondary propositions, and according as it is of or merely about its
object.
In order that we may have a rational belief in a proposition p
of the degree of certainty, it is necessary that one of two conditions
should be fulfilled—(i.) that we know p directly; or (ii.) that we know
a set of propositions h, and also know some secondary proposition q
asserting a certainty-relation between p and h. In the latter case
h may include secondary as well as primary propositions, but it is
a necessary condition that all the propositions h should be known.
In order that we may have rational belief in p of a lower degree
of probability than certainty, it is necessary that we know a set of
propositions h, and also know some secondary proposition q asserting
a probability-relation between p and h.
In the above account one possibility has been ruled out. It is
assumed that we cannot have a rational belief in p of a degree less
than certainty except through knowing a secondary proposition of the
prescribed type. Such belief can only arise, that is to say, by means of
the perception of some probability-relation. To employ a common use
of terms (though one inconsistent with the use adopted above), I have
assumed that all direct knowledge is certain. All knowledge, that is
to say, which is obtained in a manner strictly direct by contemplation
of the objects of acquaintance and without any admixture whatever
of argument and the contemplation of the logical bearing of any other
knowledge on this, corresponds to certain rational belief and not to
a merely probable degree of rational belief. It is true that there do
seem to be degrees of knowledge and rational belief, when the source
of the belief is solely in acquaintance, as there are when its source is
in argument. But I think that this appearance arises partly out of the
difficulty of distinguishing direct from indirect knowledge, and partly
out of a confusion between probable knowledge and vague knowledge.
I cannot attempt here to analyse the meaning of vague knowledge. It
is certainly not the same thing as knowledge proper, whether certain
or probable, and it does not seem likely that it is susceptible of strict
ch. ii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 17
logical treatment. At any rate I do not know how to deal with it, and
in spite of its importance I will not complicate a difficult subject by
endeavouring to treat adequately the theory of vague knowledge.
I assume then that only true propositions can be known, that the
term “probable knowledge” ought to be replaced by the term “probable
degree of rational belief,” and that a probable degree of rational belief
cannot arise directly but only as the result of an argument, out of
the knowledge, that is to say, of a secondary proposition asserting
some logical probability-relation in which the object of the belief
stands to some known proposition. With arguments, if they exist, the
ultimate premisses of which are known in some other manner than
that described above, such as might be called “probable knowledge,”
my theory is not adequate to deal without modification.*
For the objects of certain belief which is based on direct
knowledge, as opposed to certain belief arising indirectly, there is a
well-established expression; propositions, in which our rational belief
is both certain and direct, are said to be self-evident.
11. In conclusion, the relativity of knowledge to the individual
may be briefly touched on. Some part of knowledge—knowledge of
our own existence or of our own sensations—is clearly relative to
individual experience. We cannot speak of knowledge absolutely—
only of the knowledge of a particular person. Other parts of
knowledge—knowledge of the axioms of logic, for example—may seem
more objective. But we must admit, I think, that this too is relative
to the constitution of the human mind, and that the constitution
of the human mind may vary in some degree from man to man.
What is self-evident to me and what I really know, may be only a
probable belief to you, or may form no part of your rational beliefs
at all. And this may be true not only of such things as my existence,
but of some logical axioms also. Some men—indeed it is obviously
the case—may have a greater power of logical intuition than others.
*
I do not mean to imply, however, at any rate at present, that the ultimate
premisses of an argument need always be primary propositions.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 18
Further, the difference between some kinds of propositions over which
human intuition seems to have power, and some over which it has
none, may depend wholly upon the constitution of our minds and
have no significance for a perfectly objective logic. We can no
more assume that all true secondary propositions are or ought to be
universally known than that all true primary propositions are known.
The perceptions of some relations of probability may be outside the
powers of some or all of us.
What we know and what probability we can attribute to our
rational beliefs is, therefore, subjective in the sense of being relative to
the individual. But given the body of premisses which our subjective
powers and circumstances supply to us, and given the kinds of logical
relations, upon which arguments can be based and which we have
the capacity to perceive, the conclusions, which it is rational for us
to draw, stand to these premisses in an objective and wholly logical
relation. Our logic is concerned with drawing conclusions by a series
of steps of certain specified kinds from a limited body of premisses.
With these brief indications as to the relation of Probability, as I
understand it, to the Theory of Knowledge, I pass from problems of
ultimate analysis and definition, which are not the primary subject
matter of this book, to the logical theory and superstructure, which
occupies an intermediate position between the ultimate problems
and the applications of the theory, whether such applications take a
generalised mathematical form or a concrete and particular one. For
this purpose it would only encumber the exposition, without adding
to its clearness or its accuracy, if I were to employ the perfectly
exact terminology and minute refinements of language, which are
necessary for the avoidance of error in very fundamental enquiries.
While taking pains, therefore, to avoid any divergence between the
substance of this chapter and of those which succeed it, and to employ
only such periphrases as could be translated, if desired, into perfectly
exact language, I shall not cut myself off from the convenient, but
looser, expressions, which have been habitually employed by previous
ch. ii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 19
writers and have the advantage of being, in a general way at least,
immediately intelligible to the reader.*
*This question, which faces all contemporary writers on logical and
philosophical subjects, is in my opinion much more a question of style—and
therefore to be settled on the same sort of considerations as other such
questions—than is generally supposed. There are occasions for very exact
methods of statement, such as are employed in Mr. Russell’s Principia
Mathematica. But there are advantages also in writing the English of Hume.
Mr. Moore has developed in Principia Ethica an intermediate style which in his
hands has force and beauty. But those writers, who strain after exaggerated
precision without going the whole hog with Mr. Russell, are sometimes merely
pedantic. They lose the reader’s attention, and the repetitious complication
of their phrases eludes his comprehension, without their really attaining, to
compensate, a complete precision. Confusion of thought is not always best
avoided by technical and unaccustomed expressions, to which the mind has no
immediate reaction of understanding; it is possible, under cover of a careful
formalism, to make statements, which, if expressed in plain language, the mind
would immediately repudiate. There is much to be said, therefore, in favour of
understanding the substance of what you are saying all the time, and of never
reducing the substantives of your argument to the mental status of an x or y.
CHAPTER III
the measurement of probabilities
1. I have spoken of probability as being concerned with
degrees of rational belief. This phrase implies that it is in some
sense quantitative and perhaps capable of measurement. The theory
of probable arguments must be much occupied, therefore, with
comparisons of the respective weights which attach to different
arguments. With this question we will now concern ourselves.
It has been assumed hitherto as a matter of course that probability
is, in the full and literal sense of the word, measurable. I shall have
to limit, not extend, the popular doctrine. But, keeping my own
theories in the background for the moment, I will begin by discussing
some existing opinions on the subject.
2. It has been sometimes supposed that a numerical comparison
between the degrees of any pair of probabilities is not only conceivable
but is actually within our power. Bentham, for instance, in his
Rationale of Judicial Evidence,
* proposed a scale on which witnesses
might mark the degree of their certainty; and others have suggested
seriously a ‘barometer of probability.’†
That such comparison is theoretically possible, whether or not we
are actually competent in every case to make the comparison, has
been the generally accepted opinion. The following quotation‡ puts
this point of view very well:
*Book i. chap vi. (referred to by Venn).
†The reader may be reminded of Gibbon’s proposal that:—“A Theological
Barometer might be formed, of which the Cardinal (Baronius) and our
countryman, Dr. Middleton, should constitute the opposite and remote
extremities, as the former sunk to the lowest degree of credulity, which was
compatible with learning, and the latter rose to the highest pitch of scepticism,
in any wise consistent with Religion.”
‡W. F. Donkin, Phil. Mag., 1851. He is replying to an article by J. D.
Forbes (Phil. Mag., Aug. 1849) which had cast doubt upon this opinion.
20
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 21
“I do not see on what ground it can be doubted that every definite
state of belief concerning a proposed hypothesis is in itself capable
of being represented by a numerical expression, however difficult or
impracticable it may be to ascertain its actual value. It would be
very difficult to estimate in numbers the vis viva of all of the particles
of a human body at any instant; but no one doubts that it is
capable of numerical expression. I mention this because I am not sure
that Professor Forbes has distinguished the difficulty of ascertaining
numbers in certain cases from a supposed difficulty of expression by
means of numbers. The former difficulty is real, but merely relative
to our knowledge and skill; the latter, if real, would be absolute and
inherent in the subject-matter, which I conceive is not the case.”
De Morgan held the same opinion on the ground that, wherever we
have differences of degree, numerical comparison must be theoretically
possible.* He assumes, that is to say, that all probabilities can be
placed in an order of magnitude, and argues from this that they
must be measurable. Philosophers, however, who are mathematicians,
would no longer agree that, even if the premiss is sound, the
conclusion follows from it. Objects can be arranged in an order,
which we can reasonably call one of degree or magnitude, without its
being possible to conceive a system of measurement of the differences
between the individuals.
This opinion may also have been held by others, if not by
De Morgan, in part because of the narrow associations which
Probability has had for them. The Calculus of Probability has
received far more attention than its logic, and mathematicians, under
no compulsion to deal with the whole of the subject, have naturally
confined their attention to those special cases, the existence of which
*
“Whenever the terms greater and less can be applied, there twice, thrice,
etc., can be conceived, though not perhaps measured by us.”—“Theory of
Probabilities,” Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, p. 395. He is a little more guarded
in his Formal Logic, pp. 174, 175; but arrives at the same conclusion so far as
probability is concerned.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 22
will be demonstrated at a later stage, where algebraical representation
is possible. Probability has become associated, therefore, in the minds
of theorists with those problems in which we are presented with a
number of exclusive and exhaustive alternatives of equal probability;
and the principles, which are readily applicable in such circumstances,
have been supposed, without much further enquiry, to possess general
validity.
3. It is also the case that theories of probability have been
propounded and widely accepted, according to which its numerical
character is necessarily involved in the definition. It is often said, for
instance, that probability is the ratio of the number of “favourable
cases” to the total number of “cases.” If this definition is accurate,
it follows that every probability can be properly represented by a
number and in fact is a number; for a ratio is not a quantity at
all. In the case also of definitions based upon statistical frequency,
there must be by definition a numerical ratio corresponding to every
probability. These definitions and the theories based on them will
be discussed in Chapter VIII.; they are connected with fundamental
differences of opinion with which it is not necessary to burden the
present argument.
4. If we pass from the opinions of theorists to the experience
of practical men, it might perhaps be held that a presumption in
favour of the numerical valuation of all probabilities can be based on
the practice of underwriters and the willingness of Lloyd’s to insure
against practically any risk. Underwriters are actually willing, it
might be urged, to name a numerical measure in every case, and
to back their opinion with money. But this practice shows no more
than that many probabilities are greater or less than some numerical
measure, not that they themselves are numerically definite. It is
sufficient for the underwriter if the premium he names exceeds the
probable risk. But, apart from this, I doubt whether in extreme
cases the process of thought, through which he goes before naming
a premium, is wholly rational and determinate; or that two equally
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 23
intelligent brokers acting on the same evidence would always arrive
at the same result. In the case, for instance, of insurances effected
before a Budget, the figures quoted must be partly arbitrary. There
is in them an element of caprice, and the broker’s state of mind,
when he quotes a figure, is like a bookmaker’s when he names odds.
Whilst he may be able to make sure of a profit, on the principles of
the bookmaker, yet the individual figures that make up the book are,
within certain limits, arbitrary. He may be almost certain, that is to
say, that there will not be new taxes on more than one of the articles
tea, sugar, and whisky; there may be an opinion abroad, reasonable
or unreasonable, that the likelihood is in the order—whisky, tea,
sugar; and he may, therefore be able to effect insurances for equal
amounts in each at 30 per cent, 40 per cent, and 45 per cent. He
has thus made sure of a profit of 15 per cent, however absurd and
arbitrary his quotations may be. It is not necessary for the success of
underwriting on these lines that the probabilities of these new taxes
are really measurable by the figures 3
10 ,
4
10 , and 45
100 ; it is sufficient
that there should be merchants willing to insure at these rates. These
merchants, moreover, may be wise to insure even if the quotations
are partly arbitrary; for they may run the risk of insolvency unless
their possible loss is thus limited. That the transaction is in principle
one of bookmaking is shown by the fact that, if there is a specially
large demand for insurance against one of the possibilities, the rate
rises;—the probability has not changed, but the “book” is in danger
of being upset. A Presidential election in the United States supplies
a more precise example. On August 23, 1912, 60 per cent was quoted
at Lloyd’s to pay a total loss should Dr. Woodrow Wilson be elected,
30 per cent should Mr. Taft be elected, and 20 per cent should
Mr. Roosevelt be elected. A broker, who could effect insurances in
equal amounts against the election of each candidate, would be certain
at these rates of a profit of 10 per cent. Subsequent modifications of
these terms would largely depend upon the number of applicants for
each kind of policy. Is it possible to maintain that these figures in
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 24
any way represent reasoned numerical estimates of probability?
In some insurances the arbitrary element seems even greater.
Consider, for instance, the reinsurance rates for the Waratah, a vessel
which disappeared in South African waters. The lapse of time made
rates rise; the departure of ships in search of her made them fall;
some nameless wreckage is found and they rise; it is remembered that
in similar circumstances thirty years ago a vessel floated, helpless but
not seriously damaged, for two months, and they fall. Can it be
pretended that the figures which were quoted from day to day—75 per
cent, 83 per cent, 78 per cent—were rationally determinate, or
that the actual figure was not within wide limits arbitrary and
due to the caprice of individuals? In fact underwriters themselves
distinguish between risks which are properly insurable, either because
their probability can be estimated between comparatively narrow
numerical limits or because it is possible to make a “book” which
covers all possibilities, and other risks which cannot be dealt with
in this way and which cannot form the basis of a regular business
of insurance,—although an occasional gamble may be indulged in. I
believe, therefore, that the practice of underwriters weakens rather
than supports the contention that all probabilities can be measured
and estimated numerically.
5. Another set of practical men, the lawyers, have been
more subtle in this matter than the philosophers.* A distinction,
interesting for our present purpose, between probabilities, which can
be estimated within somewhat narrow limits, and those which cannot,
has arisen in a series of judicial decisions respecting damages. The
following extract†
from the Times Law Reports seems to me to deal
*Leibniz notes the subtle distinctions made by Jurisconsults between degrees
of probability; and in the preface to a work, projected but unfinished, which was
to have been entitled Ad stateram juris de gradibus probationum et probabilitatum
he recommends them as models of logic in contingent questions (Couturat,
Logique de Leibniz, p. 240).
†
I have considerably compressed the original report (Sapwell v. Bass).
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 25
very clearly in a mixture of popular and legal phraseology, with the
logical point at issue:
This was an action brought by a breeder of racehorses to recover
damages for breach of a contract. The contract was that Cyllene,
a racehorse owned by the defendant, should in the season of the
year 1909 serve one of the plaintiff’s brood mares. In the summer
of 1908 the defendant, without the consent of the plaintiff, sold
Cyllene for £30,000 to go to South America. The plaintiff claimed a
sum equal to the average profit he had made through having a mare
served by Cyllene during the past four years. During those four years
he had had four colts which had sold at £3300. Upon that basis his
loss came to 700 guineas.
Mr. Justice Jelf said that he was desirous, if he properly could,
to find some mode of legally making the defendant compensate the
plaintiff; but the question of damages presented formidable and, to his
mind, insuperable difficulties. The damages, if any, recoverable here
must be either the estimated loss of profit or else nominal damages.
The estimate could only be based on a succession of contingencies.
Thus it was assumed that (inter alia) Cyllene would be alive and
well at the time of the intended service; that the mare sent would
be well bred and not barren; that she would not slip her foal; and
that the foal would be born alive and healthy. In a case of this kind
he could only rely on the weighing of chances; and the law generally
regarded damages which depended on the weighing of chances as too
remote, and therefore irrecoverable. It was drawing the line between
an estimate of damage based on probabilities, as in “Simpson v.
L. and N.W. Railway Co.” (1, Q.B.D., 274), where Cockburn, C.J.,
said: “To some extent, no doubt, the damage must be a matter of
speculation, but that is no reason for not awarding any damages at
all,” and a claim for damages of a totally problematical character.
He (Mr. Justice Jelf) thought the present case was well over the
line. Having referred to “Mayne on Damages” (8th ed., p. 70), he
pointed out that in “Watson v. Ambergah Railway Co.” (15, Jur., 448)
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 26
Patteson, J., seemed to think that the chance of a prize might be
taken into account in estimating the damages for breach of a contract
to send a machine for loading barges by railway too late for a show;
but Erle, J., appeared to think such damage was too remote. In his
Lordship’s view the chance of winning a prize was not of sufficiently
ascertainable value at the time the contract was made to be within
the contemplation of the parties. Further, in the present case, the
contingencies were far more numerous and uncertain. He would enter
judgment for the plaintiff for nominal damages, which were all he was
entitled to. They would be assessed at 1s.
One other similar case may be quoted in further elucidation of
the same point, and because it also illustrates another point—the
importance of making clear the assumptions relative to which the
probability is calculated. This case* arose out of an offer of a Beauty
Prize† by the Daily Express. Out of 6000 photographs submitted, a
number were to be selected and published in the newspaper in the
following manner:
The United Kingdom was to be divided into districts and the
photographs of the selected candidates living in each district were to
be submitted to the readers of the paper in the district, who were to
select by their votes those whom they considered the most beautiful,
and a Mr. Seymour Hicks was then to make an appointment with
the 50 ladies obtaining the greatest number of votes and himself
select 12 of them. The plaintiff, who came out head of one of
the districts, submitted that she had not been given a reasonable
opportunity of keeping an appointment, that she had thereby lost the
value of her chance of one of the 12 prizes, and claimed damages
accordingly. The jury found that the defendant had not taken
reasonable means to give the plaintiff an opportunity of presenting
herself for selection, and assessed the damages, provided they were
*Chaplin v. Hicks (1911).
†The prize was to be a theatrical engagement and, according to the article,
the probability of subsequent marriage into the peerage.
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 27
capable of assessment, at £100, the question of the possibility of
assessment being postponed. This was argued before Mr. Justice
Pickford, and subsequently in the Court of Appeal before Lord
Justices Vaughan Williams, Fletcher Moulton, and Harwell. Two
questions arose—relative to what evidence ought the probability to
be calculated, and was it numerically measurable? Counsel for the
defendant contended that, “if the value of the plaintiff’s chance was
to be considered, it must be the value as it stood at the beginning of
the competition, not as it stood after she had been selected as one of
the 50. As 6000 photographs had been sent in, and there was also
the personal taste of the defendant as final arbiter to be considered,
the value of the chance of success was really incalculable.” The first
contention that she ought to be considered as one of 6000 not as
one of 50 was plainly preposterous and did not hoodwink the court.
But the other point, the personal taste of the arbiter, presented more
difficulty. In estimating the chance, ought the Court to receive and
take account of evidence respecting the arbiter’s preferences in types
of beauty? Mr. Justice Pickford, without illuminating the question,
held that the damages were capable of estimation. Lord Justice
Vaughan Williams in giving judgment in the Court of Appeal argued
as follows:
As he understood it, there were some 50 competitors, and there
were 12 prizes of equal value, so that the average chance of success
was about one in four. It was then said that the questions which
might arise in the minds of the persons who had to give the decisions
were so numerous that it was impossible to apply the doctrine of
averages. He did not agree. Then it was said that if precision and
certainty were impossible in any case it would be right to describe
the damages as unassessable. He agreed that there might be damages
so unassessable that the doctrine of averages was not possible of
application because the figures necessary to be applied were not
forthcoming. Several cases were to be found in the reports where it
had been so held, but he denied the proposition that because precision
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 28
and certainty had not been arrived at, the jury had no function or
duty to determine the damages. . . . He (the Lord Justice) denied that
the mere fact that you could not assess with precision and certainty
relieved a wrongdoer from paying damages for his breach of duty.
He would not lay down that in every case it could be left to the
jury to assess the damages; there were cases where the loss was so
dependent on the mere unrestricted volition of another person that it
was impossible to arrive at any assessable loss from the breach. It was
true that there was no market here; the right to compete was personal
and could not be transferred. He could not admit that a competitor
who found herself one of 50 could have gone into the market and sold
her right to compete. At the same time the jury might reasonably
have asked themselves the question whether, if there was a right to
compete, it could have been transferred, and at what price. Under
these circumstances he thought the matter was one for the jury.
The attitude of the Lord Justice is clear. The plaintiff had
evidently suffered damage, and justice required that she should
be compensated. But it was equally evident, that, relative to
the completest information available and account being taken of
the arbiter’s personal taste, the probability could be by no means
estimated with numerical precision. Further, it was impossible to say
how much weight ought to be attached to the fact that the plaintiff
had been head of her district (there were fewer than 50 districts); yet
it was plain that it made her chance better than the chances of those
of the 50 left in, who were not head of their districts. Let rough
justice be done, therefore. Let the case be simplified by ignoring some
part of the evidence. The “doctrine of averages” is then applicable, or,
in other words, the plaintiff’s loss may be assessed at twelve-fiftieths
of the value of the prize.*
6. How does the matter stand, then? Whether or not
*The jury in assessing the damages at £100, however, cannot have argued
so subtly as this; for the average value of a prize (I have omitted the details
bearing on their value) could not have been fairly estimated so high as £400.
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 29
such a thing is theoretically conceivable, no exercise of the practical
judgment is possible, by which a numerical value can actually be
given to the probability of every argument. So far from our being
able to measure them, it is not even clear that we are always able to
place them in an order of magnitude. Nor has any theoretical rule for
their evaluation ever been suggested.
The doubt, in view of these facts, whether any two probabilities
are in every case even theoretically capable of comparison in terms
of numbers, has not, however, received serious consideration. There
seems to me to be exceedingly strong reasons for entertaining the
doubt. Let us examine a few more instances.
7. Consider an induction or a generalisation. It is usually held
that each additional instance increases the generalisation’s probability.
A conclusion, which is based on three experiments in which the
unessential conditions are varied, is more trustworthy than if it were
based on two. But what reason or principle can be adduced for
attributing a numerical measure to the increase?*
Or, to take another class of instances, we may sometimes have
some reason for supposing that one object belongs to a certain
category if it has points of similarity to other known members of the
category (e.g. if we are considering whether a certain picture should
be ascribed to a certain painter), and the greater the similarity the
greater the probability of our conclusion. But we cannot in these
cases measure the increase; we can say that the presence of certain
*
It is true that Laplace and others (even amongst contemporary writers)
have believed that the probability of an induction is measurable by means of a
formula known as the rule of succession, according to which the probability of
an induction based on n instances is
n + 1
n + 2
. Those who have been convinced
by the reasoning employed to establish this rule must be asked to postpone
judgment until it has been examined in Chapter XXX. But we may point
out here the absurdity of supposing that the odds are 2 to 1 in favour of a
generalisation based on a single instance—a conclusion which this formula would
seem to justify.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 30
peculiar marks in a picture increases the probability that the artist
of whom those marks are known to be characteristic painted it, but
we cannot say that the presence of these marks makes it two or three
or any other number of times more probable than it would have been
without them. We can say that one thing is more like a second object
than it is like a third; but there will very seldom be any meaning in
saying that it is twice as like. Probability is, so far as measurement
is concerned, closely analogous to similarity.*
Or consider the ordinary circumstances of life. We are out for a
walk—what is the probability that we shall reach home alive? Has
this always a numerical measure? If a thunderstorm bursts upon us,
the probability is less than it was before; but is it changed by some
definite numerical amount? There might, of course, be data which
would make these probabilities numerically comparable; it might be
argued that a knowledge of the statistics of death by lightning would
make such a comparison possible. But if such information is not
included within the knowledge to which the probability is referred, this
fact is not relevant to the probability actually in question and cannot
affect its value. In some cases, moreover, where general statistics
are available, the numerical probability which might be derived from
them is inapplicable because of the presence of additional knowledge
with regard to the particular case. Gibbon calculated his prospects
*There are very few writers on probability who have explicitly admitted that
probabilities, though in some sense quantitative, may be incapable of numerical
comparison. Edgeworth, “Philosophy of Chance” (Mind, 1884, p. 225), admitted
that “there may well be important quantitative, although not numerical,
estimates” of probabilities. Goldschmidt (Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, p. 43)
may also be cited as holding a somewhat similar opinion. He maintains that a
lack of comparability in the grounds often stands in the way of the measurability
of the probable in ordinary usage, and that there are not necessarily good
reasons for measuring the value of one argument against that of another. On
the other hand, a numerical statement for the degree of the probable, although
generally impossible, is not in itself contradictory to the notion; and of three
statements, relating to the same circumstances, we can well say that one is
more probable than another, and that one is the most probable of the three.
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 31
of life from the volumes of vital statistics and the calculations of
actuaries. But if a doctor had been called to his assistance the nice
precision of these calculations would have become useless; Gibbon’s
prospects would have been better or worse than before, but he would
no longer have been able to calculate to within a day or week the
period for which he then possessed an even chance of survival.
In these instances we can, perhaps, arrange the probabilities in
an order of magnitude and assert that the new datum strengthens
or weakens the argument, although there is no basis for an estimate
how much stronger or weaker the new argument is than the old.
But in another class of instances is it even possible to arrange the
probabilities in an order of magnitude, or to say that one is the
greater and the other less?
8. Consider three sets of experiments, each directed towards
establishing a generalisation. The first set is more numerous; in the
second set the irrelevant conditions have been more carefully varied;
in the third case the generalisation in view is wider in scope than in
the others. Which of these generalisations is on such evidence the
most probable? There is, surely, no answer; there is neither equality
nor inequality between them. We cannot always weigh the analogy
against the induction, or the scope of the generalisation against the
bulk of the evidence in support of it. If we have more grounds than
before, comparison is possible; but, if the grounds in the two cases
are quite different, even a comparison of more and less, let alone
numerical measurement, may be impossible.
This leads up to a contention, which I have heard supported, that,
although not all measurements and not all comparisons of probability
are within our power, yet we can say in the case of every argument
whether it is more or less likely than not. Is our expectation of rain,
when we start out for a walk, always more likely than not, or less
likely than not, or as likely as not? I am prepared to argue that
on some occasions none of these alternatives hold, and that it will
be an arbitrary matter to decide for or against the umbrella. If the
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 32
barometer is high, but the clouds are black, it is not always rational
that one should prevail over the other in our minds, or even that we
should balance them,—though it will be rational to allow caprice to
determine us and to waste no time on the debate.
9. Some cases, therefore, there certainly are in which no rational
basis has been discovered for numerical comparison. It is not the case
here that the method of calculation, prescribed by theory, is beyond
our powers or too laborious for actual application. No method of
calculation, however impracticable, has been suggested. Nor have we
any prima facie indications of the existence of a common unit to
which the magnitudes of all probabilities are naturally referrible. A
degree of probability is not composed of some homogeneous material,
and is not apparently divisible into parts of like character with one
another. An assertion, that the magnitude of a given probability is in
a numerical ratio to the magnitude of every other, seems, therefore,
unless it is based on one of the current definitions of probability, with
which I shall deal separately in later chapters, to be altogether devoid
of the kind of support, which can usually be supplied in the case of
quantities of which the mensurability is not open to denial. It will be
worth while, however, to pursue the argument a little further.
10. There appear to be four alternatives. Either in some cases
there is no probability at all; or probabilities do not all belong to a
single set of magnitudes measurable in terms of a common unit; or
these measures always exist, but in many cases are, and must remain,
unknown; or probabilities do belong to such a set and their measures
are capable of being determined by us, although we are not always
able so to determine them in practice.
11. Laplace and his followers excluded the first two alternatives.
They argued that every conclusion has its place in the numerical
range of probabilities from 0 to 1, if only we knew it, and they
developed their theory of unknown probabilities.
In dealing with this contention, we must be clear as to what
we mean by saying that a probability is unknown. Do we mean
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 33
unknown through lack of skill in arguing from given evidence, or
unknown through lack of evidence? The first is alone admissible,
for new evidence would give us a new probability, not a fuller
knowledge of the old one; we have not discovered the probability
of a statement on given evidence, by determining its probability in
relation to quite different evidence. We must not allow the theory
of unknown probabilities to gain plausibility from the second sense.
A relation of probability does not yield us, as a rule, information of
much value, unless it invests the conclusion with a probability which
lies between narrow numerical limits. In ordinary practice, therefore,
we do not always regard ourselves as knowing the probability of a
conclusion, unless we can estimate it numerically. We are apt, that
is to say, to restrict the use of the expression probable to these
numerical examples, and to allege in other cases that the probability
is unknown. We might say, for example, that we do not know, when
we go on a railway journey, the probability of death in a railway
accident, unless we are told the statistics of accidents in former years;
or that we do not know our chances in a lottery, unless we are told the
number of the tickets. But it must be clear upon reflection that if we
use the term in this sense,—which is no doubt a perfectly legitimate
sense,—we ought to say that in the case of some arguments a relation
of probability does not exist, and not that it is unknown. For it is
not this probability that we have discovered, when the accession of
new evidence makes it possible to frame a numerical estimate.
Possibly this theory of unknown probabilities may also gain
strength from our practice of estimating arguments, which, as I
maintain, have no numerical value, by reference to those that have.
We frame two ideal arguments, that is to say, in which the general
character of the evidence largely resembles what is actually within our
knowledge, but which is so constituted as to yield a numerical value,
and we judge that the probability of the actual argument lies between
these two. Since our standards, therefore, are referred to numerical
measures in many cases where actual measurement is impossible, and
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 34
since the probability lies between two numerical measures, we come to
believe that it must also, if only we knew it, possess such a measure
itself.
12. To say, then, that a probability is unknown ought to mean
that it is unknown to us through our lack of skill in arguing from
given evidence. The evidence justifies a certain degree of knowledge,
but the weakness of our reasoning power prevents our knowing what
this degree is. At the best, in such cases, we only know vaguely
with what degree of probability the premisses invest the conclusion.
That probabilities can be unknown in this sense or known with less
distinctness than the argument justifies, is clearly the case. We
can through stupidity fail to make any estimate of a probability at
all, just as we may through the same cause estimate a probability
wrongly. As soon as we distinguish between the degree of belief which
it is rational to entertain and the degree of belief actually entertained,
we have in effect admitted that the true probability is not known to
everybody.
But this admission must not be allowed to carry us too far.
Probability is, vide Chapter II. (§ 12), relative in a sense to the
principles of human reason. The degree of probability, which it is
rational for us to entertain, does not presume perfect logical insight,
and is relative in part to the secondary propositions which we in fact
know; and it is not dependent upon whether more perfect logical
insight is or is not conceivable. It is the degree of probability to which
those logical processes lead, of which our minds are capable; or, in the
language of Chapter II., which those secondary propositions justify,
which we in fact know. If we do not take this view of probability, if
we do not limit it in this way and make it, to this extent, relative
to human powers, we are altogether adrift in the unknown; for we
cannot ever know what degree of probability would be justified by
the perception of logical relations which we are, and must always be,
incapable of comprehending.
13. Those who have maintained that, where we cannot assign
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 35
a numerical probability, this is not because there is none, but simply
because we do not know it, have really meant, I feel sure, that with
some addition to our knowledge a numerical value would be assignable,
that is to say that our conclusions would have a numerical probability
relative to slightly different premisses. Unless, therefore, the reader
clings to the opinion that, in every one of the instances I have cited
in the earlier paragraphs of this chapter, it is theoretically possible on
that evidence to assign a numerical value to the probability, we are
left with the first two of the alternatives of § 10, which were as follows:
either in some cases there is no probability at all; or probabilities do
not all belong to a single set of magnitudes measurable in terms of a
common unit. It would be difficult to maintain that there is no logical
relation whatever between our premiss and our conclusion in those
cases where we cannot assign a numerical value to the probability;
and if this is so, it is really a question of whether the logical relation
has characteristics, other than mensurability, of a kind to justify us
in calling it a probability-relation. Which of the two we favour is,
therefore, partly a matter of definition. We might, that is to say,
pick out from probabilities (in the widest sense) a set, if there is
one, all of which are measurable in terms of a common unit, and call
the members of this set, and them only, probabilities (in the narrow
sense). To restrict the term ‘probability’ in this way would be, I
think, very inconvenient. For it is possible, as I shall show, to find
several sets, the members of each of which are measurable in terms
of a unit common to all the members of that set; so that it would be
in some degree arbitrary* which we chose. Further, the distinction
between probabilities, which would be thus measurable and those
which would not, is not fundamental.
At any rate I aim here at dealing with probability in its widest
sense, and am averse to confining its scope to a limited type of
argument. If the opinion that not all probabilities can be measured
*Not altogether; for it would be natural to select the set to which the
relation of certainty belongs.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 36
seems paradoxical, it may be due to this divergence from a usage which
the reader may expect. Common usage, even if it involves, as a rule, a
flavour of numerical measurement, does not consistently exclude those
probabilities which are incapable of it. The confused attempts, which
have been made, to deal with numerically indeterminate probabilities
under the title of unknown probabilities, show how difficult it is
to confine the discussion within the intended limits, if the original
definition is too narrow.
14. I maintain, then, in what follows, that there are some
pairs of probabilities between the members of which no comparison
of magnitude is possible; that we can say, nevertheless, of some pairs
of relations of probability that the one is greater and the other less,
although it is not possible to measure the difference between them;
and that in a very special type of case, to be dealt with later, a
meaning can be given to a numerical comparison of magnitude. I
think that the results of observation, of which examples have been
given earlier in this chapter, are consistent with this account.
By saying that not all probabilities are measurable, I mean that
it is not possible to say of every pair of conclusions, about which we
have some knowledge, that the degree of our rational belief in one
bears any numerical relation to the degree of our rational belief in
the other; and by saying that not all probabilities are comparable in
respect of more and less, I mean that it is not always possible to say
that the degree of our rational belief in one conclusion is either equal
to, greater than, or less than the degree of our belief in another.
We must now examine a philosophical theory of the quantitative
properties of probability, which would explain and justify the
conclusions, which reflection discovers, if the preceding discussion is
correct, in the practice of ordinary argument. We must bear in mind
that our theory must apply to all probabilities and not to a limited
class only, and that, as we do not adopt a definition of probability
which presupposes its numerical mensurability, we cannot directly
argue from differences in degree to a numerical measurement of these
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 37
differences. The problem is subtle and difficult, and the following
solution is, therefore, proposed with hesitation; but I am strongly
convinced that something resembling the conclusion here set forth is
true.
15. The so-called magnitudes or degrees of knowledge or
probability, in virtue of which one is greater and another less, really
arise out of an order in which it is possible to place them. Certainty,
impossibility, and a probability, which has an intermediate value, for
example, constitute an ordered series in which the probability lies
between certainty and impossibility. In the same way there may
exist a second probability which lies between certainty and the first
probability. When, therefore, we say that one probability is greater
than another, this precisely means that the degree of our rational
belief in the first case lies between certainty and the degree of our
rational belief in the second case.
On this theory it is easy to see why comparisons of more and less
are not always possible. They exist between two probabilities, only
when they and certainty all lie on the same ordered series. But if
more than one distinct series of probabilities exist, then it is clear
that only those, which belong to the same series, can be compared.
If the attribute ‘greater’ as applied to one of two terms arises solely
out of the relative order of the terms in a series, then comparisons
of greater and less must always be possible between terms which are
members of the same series, and can never be possible between two
terms which are not members of the same series. Some probabilities
are not comparable in respect of more and less, because there exists
more than one path, so to speak, between proof and disproof, between
certainty and impossibility; and neither of two probabilities, which lie
on independent paths, bears to the other and to certainty the relation
of ‘between’ which is necessary for quantitative comparison.
If we are comparing the probabilities of two arguments, where the
conclusion is the same in both and the evidence of one exceeds the
evidence of the other by the inclusion of some fact which is favourably
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 38
relevant, in such a case a relation seems clearly to exist between the
two in virtue of which one lies nearer to certainty than the other.
Several types of argument can be instanced in which the existence
of such a relation is equally apparent. But we cannot assume its
presence in every case or in comparing in respect of more and less the
probabilities of every pair of arguments.
16. Analogous instances are by no means rare, in which, by a
convenient looseness, the phraseology of quantity is misapplied in the
same manner as in the case of probability. The simplest example is
that of colour. When we describe the colour of one object as bluer
than that of another, or say that it has more green in it, we do not
mean that there are quantities blue and green of which the object’s
colour possesses more or less; we mean that the colour has a certain
position in an order of colours and that it is nearer some standard
colour than is the colour with which we compare it.
Another example is afforded by the cardinal numbers. We say
that the number three is greater than the number two, but we do
not mean that these numbers are quantities one of which possesses
a greater magnitude than the other. The one is greater than the
other by reason of its position in the order of numbers; it is further
distant from the origin zero. One number is greater than another if
the second number lies between zero and the first.
But the closest analogy is that of similarity. When we say of
three objects A, B, and C that B is more like A than C is, we mean,
not that there is any respect in which B is in itself quantitatively
greater than C, but that, if the three objects are placed in an order
of similarity, B is nearer to A than C is. There are also, as in the
case of probability, different orders of similarity. For instance, a book
bound in blue morocco is more like a book bound in red morocco
than if it were bound in blue calf; and a book bound in red calf is
more like the book in red morocco than if it were in blue calf. But
there may be no comparison between the degree of similarity which
exists between books bound in red morocco and blue morocco, and
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 39
that which exists between books bound in red morocco and red calf.
This illustration deserves special attention, as the analogy between
orders of similarity and probability is so great that its apprehension
will greatly assist that of the ideas I wish to convey. We say that one
argument is more probable than another (i.e. nearer to certainty) in
the same kind of way as we can describe one object as more like than
another to a standard object of comparison.
17. Nothing has been said up to this point which bears
on the question whether probabilities are ever capable of numerical
comparison. It is true of some types of ordered series that there are
measurable relations of distance between their members as well as
order, and that the relation of one of its members to an ‘origin’ can
be numerically compared with the relation of another member to the
same origin. But the legitimacy of such comparisons must be matter
for special enquiry in each case.
It will not be possible to explain in detail how and in what sense
a meaning can sometimes be given to the numerical measurement
of probabilities until Part II. is reached. But this chapter will
be more complete if I indicate briefly the conclusions at which we
shall arrive later. It will be shown that a process of compounding
probabilities can be defined with such properties that it can be
conveniently called a process of addition. It will sometimes be the
case, therefore, that we can say that one probability C is equal to
the sum of two other probabilities A and B, i.e. C = A + B. If in
such a case A and B are equal, then we may write this C = 2A
and say that C is double A. Similarly if D = C + A, we may write
D = 3A, and so on. We can attach a meaning, therefore, to the
equation P = n  A, where P and A are relations of probability, and
n is a number. The relation of certainty has been commonly taken
as the unit of such conventional measurements. Hence if P represents
certainty, we should say, in ordinary language, that the magnitude
of the probability A is 1
n
. It will be shown also that we can
define a process, applicable to probabilities, which has the properties
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 40
of arithmetical multiplication. Where numerical measurement is
possible, we can in consequence perform algebraical operations of
considerable complexity. The attention, out of proportion to their real
importance, which has been paid, on account of the opportunities of
mathematical manipulation which they afford, to the limited class of
numerical probabilities, seems to be a part explanation of the belief,
which it is the principal object of this chapter to prove erroneous,
that all probabilities must belong to it.
18. We must look, then, at the quantitative characteristics of
probability in the following way. Some sets of probabilities we can
place in an ordered series, in which we can say of any pair that one is
nearer than the other to certainty,—that the argument in one case is
nearer proof than in the other, and that there is more reason for one
conclusion than for the other. But we can only build up these ordered
series in special cases. If we are given two distinct arguments, there
is no general presumption that their two probabilities and certainty
can be placed in an order. The burden of establishing the existence
of such an order lies on us in each separate case. An endeavour
will be made later to explain in a systematic way how and in what
circumstances such orders can be established. The argument for the
theory here proposed will then be strengthened. For the present it
has been shown to be agreeable to common sense to suppose that an
order exists in some cases and not in others.
19. Some of the principal properties of ordered series of
probabilities are as follows:
(i.) Every probability lies on a path between impossibility
and certainty; it is always true to say of a degree of
probability, which is not identical either with impossibility
or with certainty, that it lies between them. Thus certainty,
impossibility and any other degree of probability form an
ordered series. This is the same thing as to say that every
argument amounts to proof, or disproof, or occupies an
intermediate position.
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 41
(ii.) A path or series, composed of degrees of probability, is
not in general compact. It is not necessarily true, that is to
say, that any pair of probabilities in the same series have a
probability between them.
(iii.) The same degree of probability can lie on more than one
path (i.e. can belong to more than one series). Hence, if
B lies between A and C, and also lies between A0 and C
0
it does not follow that of A and A0
either lies between the
other and certainty. The fact, that the same probability can
belong to more than one distinct series, has its analogy in
the case of similarity.
(iv.) If ABC forms an ordered series, B lying between A and C,
and BCD forms an ordered series, C lying between B and D,
then ABCD forms an ordered series, B lying between
A and D.
20. The different series of probabilities and their mutual relations
can be most easily pictured by means of a diagram. Let us represent
an ordered series by points lying upon a path, all the points on a
given path belonging to the same series. It follows from (i.) that
the points O and I, representing the relations of impossibility and
certainty, lie on every path, and that all paths lie wholly between
these points. It follows from (iii.) that the same point can lie on more
than one path. It is possible, therefore, for paths to intersect and
cross. It follows from (iv.) that the probability represented by a given
point is greater than that represented by any other point which can
be reached by passing along a path with a motion constantly towards
the point of impossibility, and less than that represented by any point
which can be reached by moving along a path towards the point of
certainty. As there are independent paths there will be some pairs
of points representing relations of probability such that we cannot
reach one by moving from the other along a path always in the same
direction.
These properties are illustrated in the annexed diagram, O rep-
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 42
resents impossibility, I certainty, and A a numerically measurable
probability intermediate between O and I; U, V, W, X, Y, Z are nonnumerical
probabilities, of which, however, V is less than the numerical
probability A, and is also less
than W, X, and Y. X and Y
are both greater than W, and
greater than V, but are not
comparable with one another, or
with A. V and Z are both
less than W, X, and Y, but
are not comparable with one
another; U is not quantitatively
comparable with any of the probabilities V, W, X, Y, Z. Probabilities
which are numerically comparable will all belong to one series, and
the path of this series, which we may call the numerical path or
strand, will be represented by OAI.
21. The chief results which have been reached so far are collected
together below, and expressed with precision:—
(i.) There are amongst degrees of probability or rational belief
various sets, each set composing an ordered series. These
series are ordered by virtue of a relation of ‘between.’ If B is
‘between’ A and C, ABC form a series.
(ii.) There are two degrees of probability O and I between
which all other probabilities lie. If, that is to say, A is a
probability, OAI form a series. O represents impossibility
and I certainty.
(iii.) If A lies between O and B, we may write this ABc , so that
OAd and AI c are true for all probabilities.
(iv.) If ABc , the probability B is said to be greater than the
probability A, and this can be expressed by B > A.
(v.) If the conclusion a bears the relation of probability P
to the premiss h, or if, in other words, the hypothesis h
invests the conclusion a with probability P, this may be
ch. iii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 43
written aPh. It may also be written a/h = P.
This latter expression, which proves to be the more useful of
the two for most purposes, is of fundamental importance. If aPh

, this may be written a/h = a
0/h0
. The
value of the symbol a/h, which represents what is called by other
writers ‘the probability of a,’ lies in the fact that it contains explicit
reference to the data to which the probability relates the conclusion,
and avoids the numerous errors which have arisen out of the omission
of this reference.

1. In the last chapter it was assumed that in some cases the
probabilities of two arguments may be equal. It was also argued
that there are other cases in which one probability is, in some sense,
greater than another. But so far there has been nothing to show
how we are to know when two probabilities are equal or unequal.
The recognition of equality, when it exists, will be dealt with in this
chapter, and the recognition of inequality in the next. An historical
account of the various theories about this problem, which have been
held from time to time, will be given in Chapter VII.
2. The determination of equality between probabilities has
received hitherto much more attention than the determination of
inequality. This has been due to the stress which has been laid
on the mathematical side of the subject. In order that numerical
measurement may be possible, we must be given a number of
equally probable alternatives. The discovery of a rule, by which
equiprobability could be established, was, therefore, essential. A
rule, adequate to the purpose, introduced by James Bernoulli, who
was the real founder of mathematical probability,† has been widely
adopted, generally under the title of The Principle of Non-Sufficient
Reason, down to the present time. This description is clumsy and
unsatisfactory, and, if it is justifiable to break away from tradition, I
prefer to call it The Principle of Indifference.

Reason.

ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 45
The Principle of Indifference asserts that if there is no known
reason for predicating of our subject one rather than another of
several alternatives, then relatively to such knowledge the assertions
of each of these alternatives have an equal probability. Thus equal
probabilities must be assigned to each of several arguments, if there
is an absence of positive ground for assigning unequal ones.
This rule, as it stands, may lead to paradoxical and even
contradictory conclusions. I propose to criticise it in detail, and then
to consider whether any valid modification of it is discoverable. For
several of the criticisms which follow I am much indebted to Von
Kries’s Die Principien der Wahrscheinlichkeit.
*
3. If every probability was necessarily either greater than,
equal to, or less than any other, the Principle of Indifference would
be plausible. For if the evidence affords no ground for attributing
unequal probabilities to the alternative predications, it seems to follow
that they must be equal. If, on the other hand, there need be
neither equality nor inequality between probabilities, this method of
reasoning fails. Apart, however, from this objection, which is based
on the arguments of Chapter III., the plausibility of the principle will
be most easily shaken by an exhibition of the contradictions which it
involves. These fall under three or four distinct heads. In §§ 4–9 my
criticism will be purely destructive, and I shall not attempt in these
paragraphs to indicate my own way out of the difficulties.
4. Consider a proposition, about the subject of which we know
only the meaning, and about the truth of which, as applied to this
subject, we possess no external relevant evidence. It has been held
that there are here two exhaustive and exclusive alternatives—the
truth of the proposition and the truth of its contradictory—while our
knowledge of the subject affords no ground for preferring one to the
other. Thus if a and a¯ are contradictories, about the subject of which

be given on p. 96. A useful summary of his book will be found in a review by
Meinong, published in the Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen for 1890 (pp. 56–75).
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 46
we have no outside knowledge, it is inferred that the probability of
each is 1
2
.
*
In the same way the probabilities of two other propositions,
b and c, having the same subject as a, may be each 1
2
. But without
having any evidence bearing on the subject of these propositions we
may know that the predicates are contraries amongst themselves, and,
therefore, exclusive alternatives—a supposition which leads by means
of the same principle to values inconsistent with those just obtained.
If, for instance, having no evidence relevant to the colour of this book,
we could conclude that 1
2
is the probability of ‘This book is red,’ we
could conclude equally that the probability of each of the propositions
‘This book is black’ and ‘This book is blue’ is also 1
2
. So that we are
faced with the impossible case of three exclusive alternatives all as
likely as not. A defender of the Principle of Indifference might rejoin
that we are assuming knowledge of the proposition: ‘Two different
colours cannot be predicated of the same subject at the same time’;
and that, if we know this, it constitutes relevant outside evidence.
But such evidence is about the predicate, not about the subject.
*Cf. (e.g.) the well-known passage in Jevons’s Principles of Science, vol. i.
p. 243, in which he assigns the probability 1
2
to the proposition “A Platythliptic
Coefficient is positive.” Jevons points out, by way of proof, that no other
probability could reasonably be given. This, of course, involves the assumption
that every proposition must have some numerical probability. Such a contention
was first criticised, so far as I am aware, by Bishop Terrot in the Edin. Phil.
Trans. for 1856. It was deliberately rejected by Boole in his last published work
on probability: “It is a plain consequence,” he says (Edin. Phil. Trans. vol. xxi.
p. 624), “of the logical theory of probabilities, that the state of expectation
which accompanies entire ignorance of an event is properly represented, not by
the fraction 1
2
, but by the indefinite form 0
0
.” Jevons’s particular example,
however, is also open to the objection that we do not even know the meaning
of the subject of the proposition. Would he maintain that there is any sense in
saying that for those who know no Arabic the probability of every statement
expressed in Arabic is even? How far has he been influenced in the choice
of his example by known characteristics of the predicate ‘positive’? Would he
have assigned the probability 1
2
to the proposition ‘A Platythliptic Coefficient
is a perfect cube’? What about the proposition ‘A Platythliptic Coefficient is
allogeneous’?
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 47
Thus the defender of the Principle will be driven on, either to confine
it to cases where we know nothing about either the subject or the
predicate, which would be to emasculate it for all practical purposes,
or else to revise and amplify it, which is what we propose to do
ourselves.
The difficulty cannot be met by saying that we must know and
take account of the number of possible contraries. For the number of
contraries to any proposition on any evidence is always infinite; ab¯ is
contrary to a for all values of b. The same point can be put in a form
which does not involve contraries or contradictories. For example,
a/h =
1
2
and ab/h =
1
2
, if h is irrelevant both to a and to b, in the
sense required by the crude Principle of Indifference.*
It follows from
this that, if a is true, b must be true also. If it follows from the
absence of positive data that ‘A is a red book’ has a probability of 1
2
,
and that the probability of ‘A is red’ is also 1
2
, then we may deduce
that, if A is red, it must certainly be a book.
We may take it, then, that the probability of a proposition,
about the subject of which we have no extraneous evidence, is not
necessarily 1
2
. Whether or not this conclusion discredits the Principle
of Indifference, it is important on its own account, and will help later
on to confute some famous conclusions of Laplace’s school.
5. Objection can now be made in a somewhat different shape.
Let us suppose as before that there is no positive evidence relating to
the subjects of the propositions under examination which would lead
us to discriminate in any way between certain alternative predicates.
If, to take an example, we have no information whatever as to the
area or population of the countries of the world, a man is as likely
to be an inhabitant of Great Britain as of France, there being no
reason to prefer one alternative to the other.† He is also as likely to
*a/h stands for ‘the probability of a on hypothesis h.’
†This example raises a difficulty similar to that raised by Von Kries’s
example of the meteor. Stumpf has propounded an invalid solution of Von
Kries’s difficulty. Against the example proposed here, Stumpf’s solution has less
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 48
be an inhabitant of Ireland as of France. And on the same principle
he is as likely to be an inhabitant of the British Isles as of France.
And yet these conclusions are plainly inconsistent. For our first two
propositions together yield the conclusion that he is twice as likely to
be an inhabitant of the British Isles as of France.
Unless we argue, as I do not think we can, that the knowledge
that the British Isles are composed of Great Britain and Ireland is a
ground for supposing that a man is more likely to inhabit them than
France, there is no way out of the contradiction. It is not plausible to
maintain, when we are considering the relative populations of different
areas, that the number of names of subdivisions which are within our
knowledge, is, in the absence of any evidence as to their size, a piece
of relevant evidence.
At any rate, many other similar examples could be invented, which
would require a special explanation in each case; for the above is an
instance of a perfectly general difficulty. The possible alternatives
may be a, b, c, and d, and there may be no means of discriminating
between them; but equally there may be no means of discriminating
between (a or b), c, and d. This difficulty could be made striking in a
variety of ways, but it will be better to criticise the principle further
from a somewhat different side.
6. Consider the specific volume of a given substance.* Let us
suppose that we know the specific volume to lie between 1 and 3, but
that we have no information as to whereabouts in this interval its
exact value is to be found. The Principle of Indifference would allow
us to assume that it is as likely to lie between 1 and 2 as between
2 and 3; for there is no reason for supposing that it lies in one interval
rather than in the other. But now consider the specific density. The
specific density is the reciprocal of the specific volume, so that if the
latter is v the former is 1
v
. Our data remaining as before, we know
plausibility than against Von Kries’s.
*This example is taken from Von Kries, op. cit. p. 24. Von Kries does not
seem to me to explain correctly how the contradiction arises.
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 49
that the specific density must lie between 1 and 1
3
, and, by the same
use of the Principle of Indifference as before, that it is as likely to
be between 1 and 2
3
as between 2
3
and 1
3
. But the specific volume
being a determinate function of the specific density, if the latter lies
between 1 and 2
3
, the former lies between 1 and 1
1
2
, and if the latter
lies between 2
3
and 1
3
, the former lies between 1
1
2
and 3. It follows,
therefore, that the specific volume is as likely to lie between 1 and 1
1
2
as between 1
1
2
and 3; whereas we have already proved, relatively to
precisely the same data, that it is as likely to lie between 1 and 2
as between 2 and 3. Moreover, any other function of the specific
volume would have suited our purpose equally well, and by a suitable
choice of this function we might have proved in a similar manner
that any division whatever of the interval 1 to 3 yields sub-intervals
of equal probability. Specific volume and specific density are simply
alternative methods of measuring the same objective quantity; and
there are many methods which might be adopted, each yielding on
the application of the Principle of Indifference a different probability
for a given objective variation in the quantity.*
*A. Nitsche (“Die Dimensionen der Wahrscheinlichkeit und die Evidenz der
Ungewissheit,” Vierteljahrsschr. f. wissensch. Philos. vol. xvi. p. 29, 1892), in
criticising Von Kries, argues that the alternatives to which the principle must
be applied are the smallest physically distinguishable intervals, and that the
probability of the specific volume’s lying within a certain range of values turns
on the number of such distinguishable intervals in the range. This procedure
might conceivably provide the correct method of computation, but it does not
therefore restore the credit of the Principle of Indifference. For it is argued,
not that the results of applying the principle are always wrong, but that it
does not lead unambiguously to the correct procedure. If we do not know the
number of distinguishable intervals we have no reason for supposing that the
specific volume lies between 1 and 2 rather than 2 and 3, and the principle can
therefore be applied as it has been applied above. And even if we do know
the number and reckon intervals as equal which contain an equal number of
‘physically distinguishable’ parts, is it certain that this does not simply provide
us with a new system of measurement, which has the same conventional basis
as the methods of specific volume and specific density, and is no more the one
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 50
The arbitrary nature of particular methods of measurement of
this and of many other physical quantities is easily explained.
The objective quality measured may not, strictly speaking, possess
numerical quantitativeness, although it has the properties necessary
for measurement by means of correlation with numbers. The values
which it can assume may be capable of being ranged in an order,
and it will sometimes happen that the series which is thus formed
is continuous, so that a value can always be found whose order in
the series is between any two selected values; but it does not follow
from this that there is any meaning in the assertion that one value
is twice another value. The relations of continuous order can exist
between the terms of a series of values, without the relations of
numerical quantitativeness necessarily existing also, and in such cases
we can adopt a largely arbitrary measure of the successive terms,
which yields results which may be satisfactory for many purposes,
those, for instance, of mathematical physics, though not for those of
probability. This method is to select some other series of quantities
or numbers, each of the terms of which corresponds in order to one
and only one of the terms of the series which we wish to measure.
For instance, the series of characteristics, differing in degree, which
are measured by specific volume, have this relation to the series
of numerical ratios between the volumes of equal masses of the
substances, the specific volumes of which are in question, and of
water. They have it also to the corresponding ratios which give rise
to the measure of specific density. But these only yield conventional
measurements, and the numbers with which we correlate the terms
which we wish to measure can be selected in a variety of ways. It
follows that equal intervals between the numbers which represent the
ratios do not necessarily correspond to equal intervals between the
qualities under measurement; for these numerical differences depend
correct measure than these are?
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 51
upon which convention of measurement we have selected.
7. A somewhat analogous difficulty arises in connection with
the problems of what is known as ‘geometrical’ or ‘local’ probability.*
In these problems we are concerned with the position of a point or
infinitesimal area or volume within a continuum.† The number of
cases here is indefinite, but the Principle of Indifference has been
held to justify the supposition that equal lengths or areas or volumes
of the continuum are, in the absence of discriminating evidence,
equally likely to contain the point. It has long been known that
this assumption leads in numerous cases to contradictory conclusions.
If, for instance, two points A and A0 are taken at random on the
surface of a sphere, and we seek the probability that the lesser of the
two arcs of the great circle AA0
is less than a, we get one result by
assuming that the probability of a point’s lying on a given portion of
the sphere’s surface is proportional to the area of that portion, and
another result by assuming that, if a point lies on a given great circle,
the probability of its lying on a given arc of that circle is proportional
to the length of the arc, each of these assumptions being equally
justified by the Principle of Indifference.
Or consider the following problem: if a chord in a circle is drawn
at random, what is the probability that it will be less than the side
of the inscribed equilateral triangle. One can argue:—
*The best accounts of this subject are to be found in Czuber, Geometrische
Wahrscheinlichkeiten und Mittelwerte; Czuber, Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung,
vol. i. pp. 75–109; Crofton, Encycl. Brit. (9th edit.), article ‘Probability’; Borel,
Eléments de la théorie des probabilités, chaps. vi.–viii.; a few other references
are given in the following pages, and a number of discussions of individual
problems will be found in the mathematical volumes of the Educational Times.
The interest of the subject is primarily mathematical, and no discussion of its
principal problems will be attempted here.
†As Czuber points out (Wahrscheinlichkeiterechnung, vol. i. p. 84), all
problems, whether geometrical or arithmetical, which deal with a continuum
and with non-enumerable aggregates, are commonly discussed under the name
of ‘geometrical probability.’ See also Lämmel, Untersuchungen.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 52
(a) It is indifferent at what point one end of the chord lies. If
we suppose this end fixed, the direction is then chosen at
random. In this case the answer is easily shown to be 2
3
.
(b) It is indifferent in what direction we suppose the chord
to lie. Beginning with this apparently not less justifiable
assumption, we find that the answer is 1
2
.
(c) To choose a chord at random, one must choose its middle
point at random. If the chord is to be less than the side of
the inscribed equilateral triangle, the middle point must be
at a greater distance from the centre than half the radius.
But the area at a greater distance than this is 3
4
of the
whole. Hence our answer is 3
4
.
*
In general, if x and f(x) are both continuous variables, varying
always in the same or in the opposite sense, and x must lie between
a and b, then the probability that x lies between c and d, where
a < c < d < b, seems to be d - c
b - a
, and the probability that f(x) lies
between f(c) and f(d) to be f(d) - f(c)
f(b) - f(a)
. These expressions, which
represent the probabilities of necessarily concordant conclusions, are
not, as they ought to be, equal.†
8. More than one attempt has been made to separate the cases
in which the Principle of Indifference can be legitimately applied to
examples of geometrical probability from those in which it cannot.
M. Borel argues that the mathematician can define the geometrical
probability that a point M lies on a certain segment PQ of AD as
proportional to the length of the segment, but that this definition is
conventional until its consequences have been confirmed à posteriori
by their conformity with the results of empirical observation. He
points out that in actual cases there are generally some considerations
present which lead us to prefer one of the possible assumptions to the
*Bertrand, Calcul des probabilités, p. 5.
†See (e.g.) Borel, Éléments de la théorie des probabilités, p. 85.
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 53
others. Whether or not this is so, the proposed procedure amounts to
an abandonment of the Principle of Indifference as a valid criterion,
and leaves our choice undetermined when further evidence is not
forthcoming.
M. Poincaré, who also held that judgments of equiprobability in
such cases depend upon a ‘convention,’ endeavoured to minimise the
importance of the arbitrary element by showing that, under certain
conditions, the result is independent of the particular convention
which is chosen. Instead of assuming that the point is equally likely to
lie in every infinitesimal interval dx we may represent the probability
of its lying in this interval by the function f(x) dx. M. Poincaré
showed that, in the game of rouge et noir, for instance, where
we have a number of compartments arranged in a circle coloured
alternately black and white, if we can assume that f(x) is a regular
function, continuous and with continuous differential coefficients, then,
whatever the particular form of the function, the probability of black
is approximately equal to that of white.*
Whether or not investigations on these lines prove to have a
practical value, they have not, I think, any theoretical importance.
If, as I maintain, the probability f(x) is not necessarily numerical,
it is not a generally justifiable assumption to take its continuity
for granted. We have, in the particular example quoted, a number
of alternatives, half of which lead to black and half to white; the
assumption of continuity amounts to the assumption that for every
white alternative there is a black alternative whose probability is very
nearly equal to that of the white. Naturally in such a case we can
get an approximately equal probability for the whites as a whole and
for the blacks as a whole, without assuming equal probability for
each alternative individually. But this fact has no bearing on the
theoretical difficulties which we are discussing.
M. Bertrand is so much impressed by the contradictions of
*Poincaré, Calcul des probabilités, pp. 126 et seq.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 54
geometrical probability that he wishes to exclude all examples in
which the number of alternatives is infinite.
*
It will be argued in the
sequel that something resembling this is true. The discussion of this
question will be resumed in §§ 21–25.
9. There is yet another group of cases, distinct in character
from those considered so far, in which the principle does not seem to
provide us with unambiguous guidance. The typical example is that
of an urn containing black and white balls in an unknown proportion.†
The Principle of Indifference can be claimed to support the most
usual hypothesis, namely, that all possible numerical ratios of black
and white are equally probable. But we might equally well assume
that all possible constitutions ‡ of the system of balls are equally
probable, so that each individual ball is assumed equally likely to
be black or white. It would follow from this that an approximately
equal number of black and white balls is more probable than a large
excess of one colour. On this hypothesis, moreover, the drawing of
one ball and the resulting knowledge of its colour leaves unaltered the
probabilities of the various possible constitutions of the rest of the
bag; whereas on the first hypothesis knowledge of the colour of one
ball, drawn and not replaced, manifestly alters the probability of the
colour of the next ball to be drawn. Either of these hypotheses seems
*Bertrand, Calcul des probabilités, p. 4: “L’infini n’est pas un nombre; on
ne doit pas, sans explication, l’introduire dans les raisonnements. La précision
illusoire des mots pourrait faire naitre des contradictions. Choisir au hasard,
entre un nombre infini de cas possibles, n’est pas une indication suffisante.”
†The difficulty in question was first pointed out by Boole, Laws of Thought,
pp. 369–370. After discussing the Law of Succession, Boole proceeds to show
that “there are other hypotheses, as strictly involving the principle of the ‘equal
distribution of knowledge or ignorance’ which would also conduct to conflicting
results.” See also Von Kries, op. cit. pp. 31–34, 59, and Stumpf, Über den Begriff
der mathematischen Wahrscheinlichkeit, Bavarian Academy, 1892, pp. 64–68.
‡
If A and B are two balls, A white, B black, and A black, B white, are
different ‘constitutions.’ But if we consider different numerical ratios, these two
cases are indistinguishable, and count as one only.
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 55
to satisfy the Principle of Indifference, and a believer in the absolute
validity of the principle will doubtless adopt that one which enters
his mind first.*
The same point is very clearly illustrated by an example which
I take from Von Kries. Two cards, chosen from different packs, are
placed face downwards on the table; one is taken up and found to be
of a black suit: what is the chance that the other is black also? One
would naturally reply that the chance is even. But this is based on
the supposition, relatively unpopular with writers on the subject, that
every ‘constitution’ is equally probable, i.e. that each individual card
is as likely to be black as red. If we prefer this assumption, we must
relinquish the text-book theory that the drawing of a black ball from
an urn, containing black and white balls in unknown proportions,
affects our knowledge as to the proportion of black and white amongst
the remaining balls.
The alternative—or text-book—theory assumes that there are
three equal possibilities—one of each colour, both black, both red.
If both cards are black, we are twice as likely to turn up a black
card than if only one is black. After we have turned up a black, the
probability that the other is black is, therefore, twice as great as the
probability that it is red. The chance of the second’s being black is
therefore 2

.
† The Principle of Indifference has nothing to say against
either solution. Until some further criterion has been proposed we
seem compelled to agree with Poincaré that a preference for either
*C. S. Peirce in his Theory of Probable Inference (Johns Hopkins Studies in
Logic), pp. 172, 173, argues that the ‘constitution’ hypothesis is alone valid,
on the ground that, of the two hypotheses, only this one is consistent with
itself. I agree with his conclusion, and shall give at the close of the chapter the
fundamental considerations which lead to the rejection of the ‘ratio’ hypothesis.
Stumpf points out that the probability of drawing a white ball is, in any case, 1
2
.
This is true; but the probability of a second white clearly depends upon which
of the two hypotheses has been preferred. Nitsche (loc. cit. p. 31) seems to miss
the point of the difficulty in the same way.
†This is Poisson’s solution, Recherches, p. 96.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 56
hypothesis is wholly arbitrary.
10. Such, then, are the kinds of result to which an unguarded
use of the Principle of Indifference may lead us. The difficulties, to
which attention has been drawn, have been noticed before; but the
discredit has not been emphatically thrown on the original source
of error. Yet the principle certainly remains as a negative criterion;
two propositions cannot be equally probable, so long as there is any
ground for discriminating between them. The principle is a necessary,
but not, as it seems, a sufficient condition.
The enunciation of some sufficient rule is certainly essential if
we are to make any progress in the subject. But the difficulty
of discovering a correct principle is considerable. This difficulty is
partly responsible, I think, for the doubts which philosophers and
many others have often felt regarding any practical application of the
Calculus. Many candid persons, when confronted with the results of
Probability, feel a strong sense of the uncertainty of the logical basis
upon which it seems to rest. It is difficult to find an intelligible
account of the meaning of ‘probability,’ or of how we are ever to
determine the probability of any particular proposition; and yet
treatises on the subject profess to arrive at complicated results of the
greatest precision and the most profound practical importance.
The incautious methods and exaggerated claims of the school of
Laplace have undoubtedly contributed towards the existence of these
sentiments. But the general scepticism, which I believe to be much
more widely spread than the literature of the subject admits, is more
fundamental. In this matter Hume need not have felt “affrighted
and confounded with that forelorn solitude, in which I am placed
in my philosophy,” or have fancied himself “some strange uncouth
monster, who not being able to mingle and unite in society, has
been expell’d all human commerce, and left utterly abandon’d and
disconsolate.” In his views on probability, he stands for the plain man
against the sophisms and ingenuities of “metaphysicians, logicians,
mathematicians, and even theologians.”
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 57
Yet such scepticism goes too far. The judgments of probability,
upon which we depend for almost all our beliefs in matters of
experience, undoubtedly depend on a strong psychological propensity
in us to consider objects in a particular light. But this is no ground
for supposing that they are nothing more than “lively imaginations.”
The same is true of the judgments in virtue of which we assent to
other logical arguments; and yet in such cases we believe that there
may be present some element of objective validity, transcending the
psychological impulsion, with which primarily we are presented. So
also in the case of probability, we may believe that our judgments
can penetrate into the real world, even though their credentials are
subjective.
11. We must now inquire how far it is possible to rehabilitate
the Principle of Indifference or find a substitute for it. There are
several distinct difficulties which need attention in a discussion of the
problems raised in the preceding paragraphs. Our first object must
be to make the Principle itself more precise by disclosing how far its
application is mechanical and how far it involves an appeal to logical
intuition.
12. Without compromising the objective character of relations of
probability, we must nevertheless admit that there is little likelihood
of our discovering a method of recognising particular probabilities,
without any assistance whatever from intuition or direct judgment.
Inasmuch as it is always assumed that we can sometimes judge directly
that a conclusion follows from a premiss, it is no great extension
of this assumption to suppose that we can sometimes recognise
that a conclusion partially follows from, or stands in a relation of
probability to, a premiss. Moreover, the failure to explain or define
‘probability’ in terms of other logical notions, creates a presumption
that particular relations of probability must be, in the first instance,
directly recognised as such, and cannot be evolved by rule out of data
which themselves contain no statements of probability.
On the other hand, although we cannot exclude every element
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 58
of direct judgment, these judgments may be limited and controlled,
perhaps, by logical rules and principles which possess a general
application. While we may possess a faculty of direct recognition of
many relations of probability, as in the case of many other logical
relations, yet some may be much more easily recognisable than others.
The object of a logical system of probability is to enable us to know
the relations, which cannot be easily perceived, by means of other
relations which we can recognise more distinctly—to convert, in fact,
vague knowledge into more distinct knowledge.*
13. Let us seek to distinguish between the element of direct
judgment and the element of mechanical rule in the Principle of
Indifference. The enunciation of this principle, as it is ordinarily
expressed, cloaks, but does not avoid, the former element. It is in
part a formula and in part an appeal to direct inspection; but in
addition to the obscurity and ambiguity of the formula, the appeal
to intuition is not as explicit as it should be. The principle states
that ‘there must be no known reason for preferring one of a set of
alternatives to any other.’ What does this mean? What are ‘reasons,’
and how are we to know whether they do or do not justify us in
preferring one alternative to another? I do not know any discussion
of Probability in which this question has been so much as asked. If,
for example, we are considering the probability of drawing a black
*As it is the aim of trigonometry to determine the position of an object,
which is in a sense visible, not by a direct observation of it, but by observing
some other object together with certain relations, so an indirect method of this
kind is the aim of all logical system. If the truth of some propositions, and the
validity of some arguments, could not be recognised directly, we could make no
progress. We may have, moreover, some power of direct recognition where it is
not necessary in our logical system that we should make use of it. In these
cases the method of logical proof increases the certainty of knowledge, which we
might be able to possess in a more doubtful manner without it. In other cases,
that, for instance, of a complicated mathematical theorem, it enables us to know
propositions to be true, which are altogether beyond the reach of our direct
insight; just as we can often obtain knowledge about the position of a partially
visible or even invisible object by starting with observations of other objects.
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 59
ball from an urn containing balls which are black and white, we
assume that the difference of colour between the balls is not a reason
for preferring either alternative. But how do we know this, unless
by a judgment that, on the evidence in hand, our knowledge of the
colours of the balls is irrelevant to the probability in question? We
know of some respects in which the alternatives differ; but we judge
that a knowledge of these differences is not relevant. If, on the other
hand, we were taking the balls out of the urn with a magnet, and
knew that the black balls were of iron and the white of tin, we might
regard the fact, that a ball was iron and not tin, as very important
in determining the probability of its being drawn. Before, then, we
can begin to apply the Principle of Indifference, we must have made a
number of direct judgments to the effect that the probabilities under
consideration are unaffected by the inclusion in the evidence of certain
particular details. We have no right to say of any known difference
between the two alternatives that it is ‘no reason’ for preferring one
of them, unless we have judged that a knowledge of this difference is
irrelevant to the probability in question.
14. A brief digression is now necessary, in order to introduce some
new terms. There are in general two principal types of probabilities,
the magnitudes of which we seek to compare,—those in which the
evidence is the same and the conclusions different, and those in
which the evidence is different but the conclusion the same. Other
types of comparison may be required, but these two are by far the
commonest. In the first we compare the likelihood of two conclusions
on given evidence; in the second we consider what difference a change
of evidence makes to the likelihood of a given conclusion. In symbolic
language we may wish to compare x/h with y/h, or x/h with x/h1h.
We may call the first type judgments of preference, or, when there is
equality between x/h and y/h, of indifference; and the second type we
may call judgments of relevance, or, when there is equality between
x/h and x/h1h, of irrelevance. In the first we consider whether or
not x is to be preferred to y on evidence h; in the second we consider
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 60
whether the addition of h1 to evidence h is relevant to x.
The Principle of Indifference endeavours to formulate a rule which
will justify judgments of indifference. But the rule that there must
be no ground for preferring one alternative to another, involves, if it
is to be a guiding rule at all, and not a petitio principii, an appeal to
judgments of irrelevance.
The simplest definition of Irrelevance is as follows: h1 is irrelevant
to x on evidence h, if the probability of x on evidence hh1 is the
same as its probability on evidence h.
* But for a reason which will
appear in Chapter VI., a stricter and more complicated definition, as
follows, is theoretically preferable: h1 is irrelevant to x on evidence h,
if there is no proposition, inferrible from h1h but not from h, such
that its addition to evidence h affects the probability of x.
† Any
proposition which is irrelevant in the strict sense is, of course, also
irrelevant in the simpler sense; but if we were to adopt the simpler
definition, it would sometimes occur that a part of evidence would be
relevant, which taken as a whole was irrelevant. The more elaborate
definition by avoiding this proves in the sequel more convenient. If
the condition x/h1h = x/h alone is satisfied, we may say that the
evidence h1 is ‘irrelevant as a whole.’‡
It will be convenient to define also two other phrases. h1 and h2
are independent and complementary parts of the evidence, if between
them they make up h and neither can be inferred from the other. If
x is the conclusion, and h1 and h2 are independent and complementary
parts of the evidence, then h1 is relevant if the addition of it to h2
affects the probability of x.
§
*That is to say, h1 is irrelevant to x/h if x/h1h = x/h.
†That is to say, h1 is irrelevant to x/h, if there is no propsition h
0
1
such
that h
0
1/h1h = 1, h
0
1/h =| 1, and x/h0
1h =| x/h.
‡Where no misunderstanding can arise, the qualification ‘as a whole’ will be
sometimes omitted.
§
I.e. (in symbolism) h1 and h2 are independent and complementary parts
of h if h1h2 = h, h1/h2 =| 1, and h2/h1 =| 1. Also h1 is relevant if x/h =| x/h2.
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 61
Some propositions regarding irrelevance will be proved in Part II.
If h¯
1 is the contradictory of h1 and x/h1h = x/h, then x/h¯
1h = x/h.
Thus the contradictory of irrelevant evidence is also irrelevant. Also,
if x/yh = x/h, it follows that y/xh = y/h. Hence if, on initial
evidence h, y is irrelevant to x, then, on the same initial evidence,
x is irrelevant to y, i.e. if in a given state of knowledge one occurrence
has no bearing on another then equally the second has no bearing on
the first.
15. This distinction enables us to formulate the Principle of
Indifference at any rate more precisely. There must be no relevant
evidence relating to one alternative, unless there is corresponding
evidence relating to the other; our relevant evidence, that is to say,
must be symmetrical with regard to the alternatives, and must be
applicable to each in the same manner. This is the rule at which
the Principle of Indifference somewhat obscurely aims. We must first
determine what parts of our evidence are relevant on the whole by
a series of judgments of relevance, not easily reduced to rule, of the
type described above. If this relevant evidence is of the same form
for both alternatives, then the Principle authorises a judgment of
indifference.
16. This rule can be expressed more precisely in symbolic
language. Let us assume, to begin with, that the alternative
conclusions are expressible in the forms f(a) and f(b), where f(x) is
a propositional function.* The difference between them, that is to
say, can be represented in terms of a single variable.
The Principle of Indifference is applicable to the alternatives
f(a) and f(b), when the evidence h is so constituted that, if f(a) is
an independent part of h (see § 14) which is relevant to f(a), and
does not contain any independent parts which are irrelevant to f(a),
then h includes f(b) also.
The rule can be extended by successive steps to cases in which
*
If f(a), f(b), etc., are propositions, and x is a variable, capable of taking
the values a, b, etc, then f(x) is a propositional function.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 62
we have more than one variable. We can, if the necessary
conditions are fulfilled, successively compare the probabilities of
f(a1a2) and f(b1a2), and of f(b1a2) and f(b1b2) and establish equality
between f(a1a2) and f(b1b2).
This elucidation is suited to most of the cases to which the
Principle of Indifference is ordinarily applied. Thus in the favourite
examples in which balls are drawn from urns, we can infer from
our evidence no relevant proposition about white balls, such that we
cannot infer a corresponding proposition about black balls. Most of
the examples, to which the mathematical theory of chances has been
applied, and which depend upon the Principle of Indifference, can be
arranged, I think, in the forms which the rule requires as formulated
above.
17. We can now clear up the difficulties which arose over
the group of cases dealt with in § 9, the typical example of which
was the problem of the urn containing black and white balls in an
unknown proportion. This more precise enunciation of the Principle
enables us to show that of the two solutions the equiprobability
of each ‘constitution’ is alone legitimate, and the equiprobability of
each numerical ratio erroneous. Let us write the alternative ‘The
proportion of black balls is x’ = f(x), and the datum ‘There are
n balls in the bag, with regard to none of which it is known whether
they are black or white’ = h. On the ‘ratio’ hypothesis it is argued
that the Principle of Indifference justifies the judgment of indifference,
f(x)/h = f(y)/h. In order that this may be valid, it must be possible
to state the relevant evidence in the form f(x) f(y). But this is not
the case. If x =
1
2
and y =
1
4
, we have relevant knowledge about the
way in which a proportion of black balls of one half can arise, which
is not identical with our knowledge of the way in which a proportion
of one quarter can arise. If there are four balls, A, B, C, D, one half
are black, if A, B or A, C or A, D or B, C or B, D or C, D are black;
and one quarter are black, if A or B or C or D are black. These
propositions are not identical in form, and only by a false judgment
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 63
of irrelevance can we ignore them. On the ‘constitution’ hypothesis,
however, where A, B black and A, C black are treated as distinct
alternatives, this want of symmetry in our relevant evidence cannot
arise.
18. We can also deal with the point which was illustrated by
the difficulty raised in § 4. We considered there the probabilities of a
and its contradictory a¯ when there is no external evidence relevant
to either. What exactly do we mean by saying that there is no
relevant evidence? Is the addition of the word external significant? If
a represents a particular proposition, we must know something about
it, namely, its meaning. May not the apprehension of its meaning
afford us some relevant evidence? If so, such evidence must not be
excluded. If, then, we say that there is no relevant evidence, we must
mean no evidence beyond what arises from the mere apprehension of
the meaning of the symbol a. If we attach no meaning to the symbol,
it is useless to discuss the value of the probability; for the probability,
which belongs to a proposition as an object of knowledge, not as a
form of words, cannot in such a case exist.
What exactly does the symbol a stand for in the above? Does it
stand for any proposition of which we know no more than that it is
a proposition? Or does it stand for a particular proposition which
we understand but of which we know no more than is involved in
understanding it? In the former case we cannot extend our result
to a proposition of which we know even the meaning; for we should
then know more than that it is a proposition; and in the latter case
we cannot say what the probability of a is as compared with that of
its contradictory, until we know what particular proposition it stands
for; for, as we have seen, the proposition itself may supply relevant
evidence.
This suggests that a source of much confusion may lie in the use
of symbols and the notion of variables in probability. In the logic of
implication, which deals not with probability but with truth, what is
true of a variable must be equally true of all instances of the variable.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 64
In Probability, on the other hand, we must be on our guard wherever
a variable occurs. In Implication we may conclude that ? is true of
anything of which f is true. In Probability we may conclude no more
than that ? is probable of anything of which we only know that f is
true of it. If x stands for anything of which f(x) is true, as soon
as we substitute in probability any particular value, whose meaning
we know, for x, the value of the probability may be affected; for
knowledge, which was irrelevant before, may now become relevant.
Take the following example: Does f(a)/?(a) = f(b)/?(b)? That is to
say, is the probability of f’s being true of a, given only that ? is true
of a, equal to the probability of f’s being true of b, given only that
? is true of b? If this simply means that the probability of an object’s
satisfying f about which nothing is known except that it satisfies ?
is equal to ditto ditto, the equation is an identity. For in this case
f(a)/?(a) means the same as f(b)/?(b), i.e. we know nothing about
x and y except that they satisfy ?, and there is nothing whatever
by which we can distinguish a from b. But if a and b represent
specific entities, which we can distinguish, then the equality does not
necessarily hold. If, for instance, f(x) stands for ‘x is Socrates,’ then
it is plainly false that f(a)/?(a) = f(b)/?(b), where a stands for
Socrates and b does not.
19. Bearing this danger in mind, we can now give further
precision to the enunciation of the Principle of Indifference given in
§ 16. Our knowledge of the meaning of a must be taken account
of so far as it is relevant; and the Principle is only satisfied if
we have corresponding knowledge about the meaning of b. Thus
f(a)/h = f(b)/h may be true for one pair of values a, b, and not true
for another pair of values a
0
, b
0
.
This makes it possible to explain in part the contradiction
discussed in § 4. Even if it were true that the probability of a is 1
2
,
when we know nothing except that a is a proposition, it does not
follow that the probability of ‘This book is red’ is 1
2
, when we know
the meanings of ‘book’ and ‘red,’ even if we know no more than this.
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 65
Knowledge arising directly out of acquaintance with the meaning of
‘red’ may be sufficient to enable us to infer that ‘red’ and ‘not-red’
are not satisfactory alternatives to which to apply the Principle of
Indifference. How this may come about will be discussed in §§ 20, 21.
But the contradictions are not yet really solved; for some of the
difficulties discussed in § 4 can arise even when we know no more of a
and b than that they are different propositions. In fact, although we
have now stated more clearly than before how the Principle should
be enunciated, it is not yet possible to explain or to avoid all the
contradictions to which it led us in §§ 4 to 7. For this purpose we
must proceed to a further qualification.
20. The examples, in which the Principle of Indifference broke
down, had a great deal in common. We broke up the field of
possibility, as we may term it, into a number of areas by a series of
disjunctive judgments. But the alternative areas were not ultimate.
They were capable of further subdivision into other areas similar in
kind to the former. The paradoxes and contradictions arose, in each
case, when the alternatives, which the Principle of Indifference treated
as equivalent, actually contained or might contain a different or an
indefinite number of more elementary units.
In the type of cases in which the Principle of Indifference seemed
to permit the assertion that, in the absence of relevant evidence, a
proposition is as likely as its contradictory, its contradictory is not
an ultimate and indivisible alternative (in the sense to be explained
in § 21 below), even if the proposition itself satisfies this condition.
For its contradictory can be disjunctively resolved into an indefinite
number of sets of contraries to the proposition. It was out of this that
our difficulties first arose. ‘This book is not red’ includes amongst
others the alternatives ‘This book is black’ and ‘This book is blue.’
It is not, therefore, an ultimate alternative.
In the same way the contradiction of § 5 arose out of the possibility
of splitting the alternatives ‘He inhabits the British Isles’ into the
sub-alternatives ‘He inhabits Ireland or he inhabits Great Britain.’
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 66
And in the third type of case, to which the example of specific volume
and density belongs, the alternative ‘v lies in the interval 1 to 2’ can
be broken up into the sub-alternatives ‘v lies in the interval 1 to 1
1
2
or 1
1
2
to 2.’
21. This, then, seems to point the way to the qualification of
which we are in search. We must enunciate some formal rule which
will exclude those cases, in which one of the alternatives involved is
itself a disjunction of sub-alternatives of the same form. For this
purpose the following condition is proposed.
Let the alternatives, the equiprobability of which we seek to
establish by means of the Principle of Indifference, be f(a1),
f(a2). . . f(ar),
* and let the evidence be h. Then it is a necessary
condition for the application of the principle, that these should be,
relatively to the evidence, indivisible alternatives of the form f(x).
We may define a divisible alternative in the following manner:
An alternative f(ar) is divisible if
(i.) [f(ar) = f(ar
0) + f(ar
00)]/h = 1,
(ii.) f(ar
0)  f(ar
00)/h = 0,
(iii.) f(ar
0)/h =| 0 and f(ar
00)/h =| 0
The condition that the sub-alternatives must be of the same form
as the original alternatives, i.e. expressible by means of the same
propositional function f(x), deserves attention. It might be the case
that the original alternatives had nothing substantial in common; i.e.
f(x) = (x = x) is the only propositional function common to all of
them, the alternatives being a1, a2, . . . , ar. In these circumstances
the condition in question cannot be satisfied. For the proposition ar
can always be resolved into the disjunction arb + ar
¯b, where b is
any proposition and ¯b its contradictory. If, on the other hand, the
*The more complicated cases in which the propositional function, of which
the alternatives are instances, involves more than one variable (see § 16), can be
dealt with in a similar manner mutatis mutandis.
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 67
alternatives which we are comparing can be expressed in the forms
f(a1) and f(a2), where the function f(x) is distinct from x, it is
not necessarily the case that either of these can be resolved into a
disjunctive combination of terms which can be expressed in their turn
in the same form.
Dispensing with symbolism, we can express these conditions
as follows: Our knowledge must not enable us to split up the
alternative f(ar) into a disjunction of two sub-alternatives, (i.) which
are themselves expressible in the same form f, (ii.) which are mutually
exclusive, and (iii.) which, on the evidence, are possible.
In short, the Principle of Indifference is not applicable to a pair
of alternatives, if we know that either of them is capable of being
further split up into a pair of possible but incompatible alternatives
of the same form as the original pair.
22. This rule commends itself to common sense. If we know
that the two alternatives are compounded of a different number or of
an indefinite number of sub-alternatives which are in other respects
similar, so far as our evidence goes to the original alternatives, then
this is a relevant fact of which we must take account. And as it
affects the two alternatives in differing and unsymmetrical ways, it
breaks down the fundamental condition for the valid application of
the Principle of Indifference.
Neither this consideration nor that discussed in §§ 18 and 19
substantially modify the Principle of Indifference as enunciated in
§ 16. They have only served to make explicit what was always
implicit in the Principle, by explaining the manner in which our
knowledge of the form and meaning of the alternatives may be a
relevant part of the evidence. The apparent contradictions arose from
paying attention to what we may term the extraneous evidence only,
to the neglect of such part of the evidence as bore upon the form and
meaning of the alternatives.
23. The application of this result to the examples cited in § 18
is not difficult. It excludes the class of cases in which a proposition
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 68
and its contradictory constitute the alternatives. For if b is the
proposition and ¯b its contradictory, we cannot find a propositional
function f(x) which will satisfy the necessary conditions. It deals
also with the type of contradiction which arose in considering the
probability that an individual taken at random was an inhabitant of
a given region. If, on the other hand, the term ‘country’ is so defined
that one country cannot include two countries, then an individual is,
relatively to suitable hypotheses, as likely to be an inhabitant of one
as of another. For the function f(x), where f(x) = ‘the individual
is an inhabitant of country x,’ satisfies the conditions. And it deals
with the example of ranges of specific volume and specific density,
because there is no range which does not contain within itself two
similar ranges. As there are in this case no definite units by which we
can define equal ranges, the device, which will be referred to in § 25
for dealing with geometrical probabilities, is not available.
24. It is worth while to add that the qualification of § 21 is fatal
to the practical utility of the Principle of Indifference in those cases
only in which it is possible to find no ultimate alternatives which
satisfy the conditions. For if the original alternatives each comprise
a definite number of indivisible and indifferent sub-alternatives, we
can compute their probabilities. It is often the case, however, that
we cannot by any process of finite subdivision arrive at indivisible
sub-alternatives, or that, if we can, they are not on the evidence
indifferent. In the examples given above, for instance, where f(x) = x,
or where x is a part of unspecified magnitude in a continuum, there
are no indivisible sub-alternatives. The first type comprises all cases,
amongst others, in which we weigh the probabilities of a proposition
and its contradictory; and the second includes a great number of
cases in which physical or geometrical quantities are involved.
25. We can now return to the numerous paradoxes which arise
in the study of geometrical probability (see §§ 7, 8). The qualification
of § 21 enables us, I think, to discover the source of the confusion.
Our alternatives in these problems relate to certain areas or segments
ch. iv FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 69
or arcs, and however small the elements are which we adopt as our
alternatives, they are made up of yet smaller elements which would
also serve as alternatives. Our rule, therefore, is not satisfied, and,
as long as we enunciate them in this shape, we cannot employ the
Principle of Indifference. But it is easy in most cases to discover
another set of alternatives which do satisfy the condition, and which
will often serve our purpose equally well. Suppose, for instance, that
a point lies on a line of length m.l., we may write the alternative
‘the interval of length l on which the point lies is the xth interval
of that length as we move along the line from left to right’ = f(x);
and the Principle of Indifference can then be applied safely to the
m alternatives f(1), f(2). . . f(m), the number m increasing as the
length l of the intervals is diminished. There is no reason why
l should not be of any definite length however small.
If we deal with the problems of geometrical probability in this
way, we shall avoid the contradictory conclusions, which arise from
confusing together distinct elementary areas. In the problem, for
instance, of the chord drawn at random in a circle, which is discussed
in § 7, the chord is regarded, not as a one-dimensional line, but as the
limit of an area, the shape of which is different in each of the variant
solutions. In the first solution it is the limit of a triangle, the length
of the base of which tends to zero; in the second solution it is the
limit of a quadrilateral, two of the sides of which are parallel and at a
distance apart which tends to zero; and in the third solution the area
is defined by the limiting position of a central section of undefined
shape. These distinct hypotheses lead inevitably to different results.
If we were dealing with a strictly linear chord, the Principle of
Indifference would yield us no result, as we could not enunciate the
alternatives in the required form; and if the chord is an elementary
area, we must know the shape of the area of which it is the limit.
So long as we are careful to enunciate the alternatives in a form
to which the Principle of Indifference can be applied unambiguously,
we shall be prevented from confusing together distinct problems, and
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 70
shall be able to reach conclusions in geometrical probability which are
unambiguously valid.
The substance of this explanation can be put in a slightly different
way by saying that it is not a matter of indifference in these
cases in what manner we proceed to the limit. We must assign
the probabilities before proceeding to the limit, which we can do
unambiguously. But if the problem in hand does not stop at small
finite lengths, areas, or volumes, and we have to proceed to the
limit, then the final result depends upon the shape in which the
body approaches the limit. Mathematicians will recognise an analogy
between this case and the determination of potential at points within
a conductor. Its value depends upon the shape of the area which in
the limit represents the point.
26. The positive contributions of this chapter to the
determination of valid judgments of equiprobability are two. In the
first place we have stated the Principle of Indifference in a more
accurate form, by displaying its necessary dependence upon judgments
of relevance and so bringing out the hidden element of direct judgment
or intuition, which it has always involved. It has been shown that the
Principle lays down a rule by which direct judgments of relevance and
irrelevance can lead on to judgments of preference and indifference.
In the second place, some types of consideration, which are in fact
relevant, but which are in danger of being overlooked, have been
brought into prominence. By this means it has been possible to avoid
the various types of doubtful and contradictory conclusions to which
the Principle seemed to lead, so long as we applied it without due
qualification.
CHAPTER V
other methods of determining probabilities
1. The recognition of the fact, that not all probabilities
are numerical, limits the scope of the Principle of Indifference. It
has always been agreed that a numerical measure can actually be
obtained in those cases only in which a reduction to a set of exclusive
and exhaustive equiprobable alternatives is practicable. Our previous
conclusion that numerical measurement is often impossible agrees very
well, therefore, with the argument of the preceding chapter that the
rules, in virtue of which we can assert equiprobability, are somewhat
limited in their field of application.
But the recognition of this same fact makes it more necessary to
discuss the principles which will justify comparisons of more and less
between probabilities, where numerical measurement is theoretically,
as well as practically, impossible. We must, for the reasons given in
the preceding chapter, rely in the last resort on direct judgment. The
object of the following rules and principles is to reduce the judgments
of preference and relevance, which we are compelled to make, to a
few relatively simple types.*
2. We will enquire first in what circumstances we can expect a
comparison of more and less to be theoretically possible. I am inclined
to think that this is a matter about which, rather unexpectedly
perhaps, we are able to lay down definite rules. We are able, I think,
always to compare a pair of probabilities which are
(i.) of the type ab/h and a/h,
or (ii.) of the type a/hh1 and a/h,
provided the additional evidence h1 contains only one independent
piece of relevant information.
*Parts of Chap. XV. are closely connected with the topics of the following
paragraphs, and the discussion which is commenced here is concluded there.

(i.) The propositions of Part II. will enable us to prove that
ab/h < a/h unless b/ah = 1;
that is to say, the probability of our conclusion is diminished by the
addition to it of something, which on the hypothesis of our argument
cannot be inferred from it. This proposition will be self-evident to
the reader. The rule, that the probability of two propositions jointly
is, in general, less than that of either of them separately, includes the
rule that the attribution of a more specialised concept is less probable
than the attribution of a less specialised concept.
(ii.) This condition requires a little more explanation. It
states that the probability a/hh1 is always greater than, equal
to, or less than the probability a/h, if h1 contains no pair of
complementary and independent parts* both relevant to a/h. If h1 is
favourable, a/hh1 > a/h. Similarly, if h2 is favourable to a/hh1,
a/hh1h2 > a/hh1. The reverse holds if h1 and h2 are unfavourable.
Thus we can compare a/hh0 and a/h, in every case in which the
relevant independent parts of the additional evidence h
0 are either
all favourable, or all unfavourable. In cases in which our additional
evidence is equivocal, part taken by itself being favourable and part
unfavourable, comparison is not necessarily possible. In ordinary
language we may assert that, according to our rule, the addition to
our evidence of a single fact always has a definite bearing on our
conclusion. It either leaves its probability unaffected and is irrelevant,
or it has a definitely favourable or unfavourable bearing, being
favourably or unfavourably relevant. It cannot affect the conclusion
in an indefinite way, which allows no comparison between the two
probabilities. But if the addition of one fact is favourable, and the
addition of a second is unfavourable, it is not necessarily possible to
compare the probability of our original argument with its probability
when it has been modified by the addition of both the new facts.
*See Chap. IV. § 14 for the meaning of these terms.
ch. v FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 73
Other comparisons are possible by a combination of these two
principles with the Principle of Indifference. We may find, for
instance, that a/hh1 > a/h, that a/h = b/h, that b/h > b/hh2, and
that, therefore, a/hh1 > b/hh2. We have thus obtained a comparison
between a pair of probabilities, which are not of the types discussed
above, but without the introduction of any fresh principle. We may
denote comparisons of this type by (iii.).
3. Whether any comparisons are possible which do not fall
within any of the categories (i.), (ii.), or (iii.), I do not feel certain.
We undoubtedly make a number of direct comparisons which do not
seem to be covered by them. We judge it more probable, for instance,
that Caesar invaded Britain than that Romulus founded Rome. But
even in such cases as this, where a reduction into the regular form
is not obvious, it might prove possible if we could clearly analyse
the real grounds of our judgment. We might argue in this instance
that, whereas Romulus’s founding of Rome rests solely on tradition,
we have in addition evidence of another kind for Caesar’s invasion of
Britain, and that, in so far as our belief in Caesar’s invasion rests on
tradition, we have reasons of a precisely similar kind as for our belief
in Romulus without the additional doubt involved in the maintenance
of a tradition between the times of Romulus and Caesar. By some
such analysis as this our judgment of comparison might be brought
within the above categories.
The process of reaching a judgment of comparison in this way
may be called ‘schematisation.’* We take initially an ideal scheme
which falls within the categories of comparison. Let us represent ‘the
historical tradition x has been handed down from a date many years
previous to the time of Caesar’ by ?1(x); ‘the historical tradition x
has been handed down from the time of Caesar’ by ?2(x); ‘the
historical tradition x has extra-traditional support’ by ?3(x); and
the two traditions, the Romulus tradition and the Caesar tradition
*This phrase is used by Von Kries, op. cit. p. 179, in a somewhat similar
connection.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 74
respectively, by a and b. Then if our relevant evidence h were of the
form ?1(a)?2(b)?3(b), it is easily seen that the comparison a/h < b/h
could be justified on the lines laid down above.* A further judgment,
that our actual evidence presented no relevant divergence from this
schematic form, would then establish the practical conclusion. As
I am not aware of any plausible judgment of comparison which we
make in common practice, but which is clearly incapable of reduction
to some schematic form, and as I see no logical basis for such a
comparison, I feel justified in doubting the possibility of comparing
the probabilities of arguments dissimilar in form and incapable of
schematic reduction. But the point must remain very doubtful until
this part of the subject has received a more prolonged consideration.
4. Category (ii.) is very wide, and evidently covers a great
variety of cases. If we are to establish general principles of argument
and so avoid excessive dependence on direct individual judgments of
relevance, we must discover some new and more particular principles
included within it. Two of these—those of Analogy and of Induction—
are excessively important, and will be the subject of Part III. of
this book. In addition to these a few criteria will be examined and
established in Chapter XIV., §§ 4 and 8 (49.1). We must be content
here (pending the symbolic developments of Part II.) with the two
observations following:
(1) The addition of new†
evidence h1 to a doubtful‡ argument a/h
is favourably relevant, if either of the following conditions is fulfilled:—
(a) if a/hh1 = 0; (b) if a/hh1 = 1. Divested of symbolism, this merely
amounts to a statement that a piece of evidence is favourable if, in
conjunction with the previous evidence, it is either a necessary or a
sufficient condition for the truth of our conclusion.
(2) It might plausibly be supposed that evidence would be
*For a/?2(a) = b/?2(b); a/?1(a) < a/?2(a); b/?2(b) < b/?2(b)?3(b);
a/?1(a) = a/h; and b/?2(b)?3(b) = b/h.
†h1 is new evidence so long as h1/h =| 1.
‡The argument is doubtful so long as a/h is neither certain nor impossible.
ch. v FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 75
favourable to our conclusion which is favourable to favourable
evidence—i.e. that, if h1 is favourable to x/h and x is favourable
to a/h, h1 is favourable to a/h. Whilst, however, this argument
is frequently employed under conditions, which, if explicitly stated,
would justify it, there are also conditions in which this is not so, so
that it is not necessarily valid. For the very deceptive fallacy involved
in the above supposition, Mr. Johnson has suggested to me the name
of the Fallacy of the Middle Term. The general question—If h1 is
favourable to x/h and x is favourable to a/h, in what conditions is
h1 favourable to a/h?—will be examined in Chapter XIV. §§ 4 and
8 (49.1). In the meantime, the intuition of the reader towards the
fallacy may be assisted by the following observations, which are due
to Mr. Johnson:
Let x, x
0
, x
00
. . . be exclusive and exhaustive alternatives under
datum h. Let h1 and a be concordant in regard to each of these
alternatives: i.e. any hypothesis which is strengthened by h1 will
strengthen a, and any hypothesis which is weakened by h1 will
weaken a. It is obvious that, if h1 strengthens some of the hypotheses
x, x
0
, x
00
. . ., it will weaken others. This fact helps us to see why we
cannot consider the concordance of h1 and a in regard to one single
alternative, but must be able to assert their concordance with regard
to every one of the exclusive and exhaustive alternatives, including
the particular one taken. But a further condition is needed, which (as
we shall show) is obviously satisfied in two typical problems at least.
This further condition is that, for each hypothesis x, x
0
, x
00
. . ., it
shall hold that, were this hypothesis known to be true, the knowledge
of h1 would not weaken the probability of a.
These two conditions are sufficient to ensure that h1 shall
strengthen a (independently of knowledge of x, x
0
, x
00
. . .); and, in a
sense, they appear to be necessary; for, unless they are satisfied, the
dependence of h1 upon a would be (so to speak) accidental as regards
the ‘middle terms,’ (x, x
0
, x
00
. . .).
The necessity for reference to all the alternatives x, x
0
, x
00
. . . is
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 76
analogous to the requirement of distribution of the middle term in
ordinary syllogism. Thus, from premises “All P is x, all S is x,” the
conclusion that “S’s are P” does not formally follow; but given “all P
is x and all S is x
0
” it does follow that “no S are P”, where x
0
is any
contrary to x. The two conditions taken together would be analogous
to the argument: all x S is P; all x
0 S is P; all x
00 S is P; . . . therefore
all S is P.
First Typical Problem.—An urn contains an unknown proportion
of differently coloured balls. A ball is drawn and replaced. Then
x, x
0
, x
00
. . . stand for the various possible proportions. Let h1 mean
“a white ball has been drawn”; and let a mean “a white ball will
be again drawn.” Then any hypothesis which is strengthened by h1
will strengthen a; and any hypothesis which is weakened by h1 will
weaken a. Moreover, were any one of these hypotheses known to be
true, the knowledge of h1 would not weaken the probability of a.
Hence, in the absence of definite knowledge as regards x, x
0
, x
00
. . .,
the knowledge of h1 would strengthen the probability of a.
Second Typical Problem.—Let a certain event have taken place;
which may have been x, x
0
, x
00 or . . . . Let h1 mean that A reports
so and so; and let a mean that B reports similarly or identically.
The phrase similarly merely indicates that any hypothesis as to the
actual fact, which would be strengthened by A’s report, would be
strengthened by B’s report. Of course, even if the reports were
verbally identical, A’s evidence would not necessarily strengthen the
hypothesis in an equal degree with B’s; because A and B may be
unequally expert or intelligent. Now, in such cases, we may further
affirm (in general), that, were the actual nature of the event known,
the knowledge of A’s report on it would not weaken (though it also
need not strengthen) the probability that B would give a similar
report. Hence, in the absence of such knowledge, the knowledge of h1
would strengthen the probability of a.
5. Before leaving this part of the argument we must emphasise
the part played by direct judgment in the theory here presented.
ch. v FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 77
The rules for the determination of equality and inequality between
probabilities all depend upon it at some point. This seems to me
quite unavoidable. But I do not feel that we should regard it as a
weakness. For we have seen that most, and perhaps all, cases can
be determined by the application of general principles to one simple
type of direct judgment. No more is asked of the intuitive power
applied to particular cases than to determine whether a new piece of
evidence tells, on the whole, for or against a given conclusion. The
application of the rules involves no wider assumptions than those of
other branches of logic.
While it is important, in establishing a control of direct judgment
by general principles, not to conceal its presence, yet the fact that
we ultimately depend upon an intuition need not lead us to suppose
that our conclusions have, therefore, no basis in reason, or that they
are as subjective in validity as they are in origin. It is reasonable
to maintain with the logicians of the Port Royal that we may draw
a conclusion which is truly probable by paying attention to all the
circumstances which accompany the case, and we must admit with
as little concern as possible Hume’s taunt that “when we give the
preference to one set of arguments above another, we do nothing but
decide from our feeling concerning the superiority of their influence.”
CHAPTER VI
the weight of arguments
1. The question to be raised in this chapter is somewhat
novel; after much consideration I remain uncertain as to how much
importance to attach to it. The magnitude of the probability
of an argument, in the sense discussed in Chapter III., depends
upon a balance between what may be termed the favourable and
the unfavourable evidence; a new piece of evidence which leaves
this balance unchanged, also leaves the probability of the argument
unchanged. But it seems that there may be another respect in which
some kind of quantitative comparison between arguments is possible.
This comparison turns upon a balance, not between the favourable
and the unfavourable evidence, but between the absolute amounts of
relevant knowledge and of relevant ignorance respectively.
As the relevant evidence at our disposal increases, the magnitude
of the probability of the argument may either decrease or increase,
according as the new knowledge strengthens the unfavourable or the
favourable evidence; but something seems to have increased in either
case,—we have a more substantial basis upon which to rest our
conclusion. I express this by saying that an accession of new evidence
increases the weight of an argument. New evidence will sometimes
decrease the probability of an argument, but it will always increase
its ‘weight.’
2. The measurement of evidential weight presents similar
difficulties to those with which we met in the measurement of
probability. Only in a restricted class of cases can we compare the
weights of two arguments in respect of more and less. But this must
always be possible where the conclusion of the two arguments is the
same, and the relevant evidence in the one includes and exceeds the
evidence in the other. If the new evidence is ‘irrelevant,’ in the more
precise of the two senses defined in § 14 of Chapter IV., the weight is
78
ch. vi FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 79
left unchanged. If any part of the new evidence is relevant, then the
value is increased.
The reason for our stricter definition of ‘relevance’ is now apparent.
If we are to be able to treat ‘weight’ and ‘relevance’ as correlative
terms, we must regard evidence as relevant, part of which is
favourable and part unfavourable, even if, taken as a whole, it leaves
the probability unchanged. With this definition, to say that a new
piece of evidence is ‘relevant’ is the same thing as to say that it
increases the ‘weight’ of the argument.
A proposition cannot be the subject of an argument, unless we
at least attach some meaning to it, and this meaning, even if it
only relates to the form of the proposition, may be relevant in
some arguments relating to it. But there may be no other relevant
evidence; and it is sometimes convenient to term the probability of
such an argument an à priori probability. In this case the weight
of the argument is at its lowest. Starting, therefore, with minimum
weight, corresponding to à priori probability, the evidential weight of
an argument rises, though its probability may either rise or fall, with
every accession of relevant evidence.
3. Where the conclusions of two arguments are different, or
where the evidence for the one does not overlap the evidence for the
other, it will often be impossible to compare their weights, just as
it may be impossible to compare their probabilities. Some rules of
comparison, however, exist, and there seems to be a close, though
not a complete, correspondence between the conditions under which
pairs of arguments are comparable in respect of probability and of
weight respectively. We found that there were three principal types
in which comparison of probability was possible, other comparisons
being based on a combination of these:—
(i.) Those based on the Principle of Indifference, subject to certain
conditions, and of the form fa/?a  h1 = fb/?b  h2, where h1 and h2
are irrelevant to the arguments.
(ii.) a/hh1 ? a/h, where h1 is a single unit of information,
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 80
containing no independent parts which are relevant.
(iii.) ab/h = a/h
Let us represent the evidential weight of the argument, whose
probability is a/h, by V(a/h). Then, corresponding to the above, we
find that the following comparisons of weight are possible:—
(i.) V(fa/?a  h1) = V(fb/?b  h2), where h1 and h2 are irrelevant
in the strict sense. Arguments, that is to say, to which the Principle
of Indifference is applicable, have equal evidential weights.
(ii.) V(a/hh1) > V(a/h), unless h1 is irrelevant, in which case
V(a/hh1) = V(a/h). The restriction on the composition of h1, which
is necessary in the case of comparisons of magnitude, is not necessary
in the case of weight.
There is, however, no rule for comparisons of weight corresponding
to (iii.) above. It might be thought that V(ab/h) < V(a/h), on the
ground that the more complicated an argument is, relative to given
premisses, the less is its evidential weight. But this is invalid. The
argument ab/h is further off proof than was the argument a/h; but
it is nearer disproof. For example, if ab/h = 0 and a/h > 0, then
V(ab/h) > V(A/h). In fact it would seem to be the case that the
weight of the argument a/h is always equal to that of a/h ¯ , where a¯
is the contradictory of a; i.e., V(a/h) = V(¯a/h). For an argument
is always as near proving or disproving a proposition, as it is to
disproving or proving its contradictory.
4. It may be pointed out that if a/h = b/h, it does not
necessarily follow that V(a/h) = V(b/h). It has been asserted already
that if the first equality follows directly from a single application of
the Principle of Indifference, the second equality also holds. But the
first equality can exist in other cases also. If, for instance, a and b
are members respectively of different sets of three equally probable
exclusive and exhaustive alternatives, then a/h = b/h; but these
arguments may have very different weights. If, however, a and b can
each, relatively to h, be inferred from the other, i.e. if a/bh = 1 and
b/ah = 1, then V(a/h) = V(b/h). For in proving or disproving one,
ch. vi FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 81
we are necessarily proving or disproving the other.
Further principles could, no doubt, be arrived at. The above
can be combined to reach results in cases upon which unaided
common sense might feel itself unable to pronounce with confidence.
Suppose, for instance, that we have three exclusive and exhaustive
alternatives, a, b, and c, and that a/h = b/h in virtue of the
Principle of Indifference, then we have V(a/h) = V(b/h) and
V(a/h) = V(¯a/h), so that V(b/h) = V(¯a/h). It is also true, since
a/¯ (b + c)h = 1 and (b + c)/ah¯ = 1, that V(¯a/h) = V((b + c)/h). Hence
V(b/h) = V((b + c)/h).
5. The preceding paragraphs will have made it clear that the
weighing of the amount of evidence is quite a separate process from
the balancing of the evidence for and against. In so far, however,
as the question of weight has been discussed at all, attempts have
been made, as a rule, to explain the former in terms of the latter.
If x/h1h2 =
2
3
and x/h1 =
3
4
, it has sometimes been supposed that
it is more probable that x/h1h2 really is 2
3
than that x/h1 really
is 3
4
. According to this view, an increase in the amount of evidence
strengthens the probability of the probability, or, as De Morgan
would say, the presumption of the probability. A little reflection will
show that such a theory is untenable. For the probability of x on
hypothesis h1 is independent of whether as a matter of fact x is or is
not true, and if we find out subsequently that x is true, this does not
make it false to say that on hypothesis h1 the probability of x is 3
4
.
Similarly the fact that x/h1h2 is 2
3
does not impugn the conclusion
that x/h1 is 3
4
, and unless we have made a mistake in our judgment
or our calculation on the evidence, the two probabilities are 2
3
and 3
4
respectively.
6. A second method, by which it might be thought, perhaps,
that the question of weight has been treated, is the method of
probable error. But while probable error is sometimes connected
with weight, it is primarily concerned with quite a different question.
‘Probable error,’ it should be explained, is the name given, rather
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 82
inconveniently perhaps, to an expression which arises when we
consider the probability that a given quantity is measured by one of
a number of different magnitudes. Our data may tell us that one of
these magnitudes is the most probable measure of the quantity; but in
some cases it will also tell us how probable each of the other possible
magnitudes of the quantity is. In such cases we can determine the
probability that the quantity will have a magnitude which does not
differ from the most probable by more than a specified amount. The
amount, which the difference between the actual value of the quantity
and its most probable value is as likely as not to exceed, is the
‘probable error.’ In many practical questions the existence of a small
probable error is of the greatest importance, if our conclusions are to
prove valuable. The probability that the quantity has any particular
magnitude may be very small; but this may matter very little, if
there is a high probability that it lies within a certain range.
Now it is obvious that the determination of probable error is
intrinsically a different problem from the determination of weight.
The method of probable error is simply a summation of a number
of alternative and exclusive probabilities. If we say that the most
probable magnitude is x and the probable error y, this is a way,
convenient for many purposes, of summing up a number of probable
conclusions regarding a variety of magnitudes other than x which,
on the evidence, the quantity may possess. The connection between
probable error and weight, such as it is, is due to the fact that in
scientific problems a large probable error is not uncommonly due to
a great lack of evidence, and that as the available evidence increases
there is a tendency for the probable error to diminish. In these cases
the probable error may conceivably be a good practical measure of
the weight.
It is necessary, however, in a theoretical discussion, to point out
that the connection is casual, and only exists in a limited class of
cases. This is easily shown by an example. We may have data
on which the probability of x = 5 is 1
3
, of x = 6 is 1
4
, of x = 7
ch. vi FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 83
is 1
5
, of x = 8 is 1
6
, and of x = 9 is 1
20 . Additional evidence might
show that x must either be 5 or 8 or 9, the probabilities of each
of these conclusions being 7
16 ,
5
16 ,
4
16 . The evidential weight of the
latter argument is greater than that of the former, but the probable
error, so far from being diminished, has been increased. There is, in
fact, no reason whatever for supposing that the probable error must
necessarily diminish, as the weight of the argument is increased.
The typical case, in which there may be a practical connection
between weight and probable error, may be illustrated by the two
cases following of balls drawn from an urn. In each case we require
the probability of drawing a white ball; in the first case we know
that the urn contains black and white in equal proportions; in the
second case the proportion of each colour is unknown, and each ball
is as likely to be black as white. It is evident that in either case
the probability of drawing a white ball is 1
2
but that the weight
of the argument in favour of this conclusion is greater in the first
case. When we consider the most probable proportion in which balls
will be drawn in the long run, if after each withdrawal they are
replaced, the question of probable error enters in, and we find that
the greater evidential weight of the argument on the first hypothesis
is accompanied by the smaller probable error.
This conventionalised example is typical of many scientific
problems. The more we know about any phenomenon, the less likely,
as a rule, is our opinion to be modified by each additional item of
experience. In such problems, therefore, an argument of high weight
concerning some phenomenon is likely to be accompanied by a low
probable error, when the character of a series of similar phenomena
is under consideration.
7. Weight cannot, then, be explained in terms of probability.
An argument of high weight is not ‘more likely to be right’ than
one of low weight; for the probabilities of these arguments only state
relations between premiss and conclusion, and these relations are
stated with equal accuracy in either case. Nor is an argument of
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 84
high weight one in which the probable error is small; for a small
probable error only means that magnitudes in the neighbourhood of
the most probable magnitude have a relatively high probability, and
an increase of evidence does not necessarily involve an increase in
these probabilities.
The conclusion, that the ‘weight’ and the ‘probability’ of an
argument are independent properties, may possibly introduce a
difficulty into the discussion of the application of probability to
practice.* For in deciding on a course of action, it seems plausible
to suppose that we ought to take account of the weight as well as
the probability of different expectations. But it is difficult to think of
any clear example of this, and I do not feel sure that the theory of
‘evidential weight’ has much practical significance.
Bernoulli’s second maxim, that we must take into account all
the information we have, amounts to an injunction that we should
be guided by the probability of that argument, amongst those of
which we know the premisses, of which the evidential weight is the
greatest. But should not this be re-enforced by a further maxim,
that we ought to make the weight of our arguments as great as
possible by getting all the information we can?†
It is difficult to see,
however, to what point the strengthening of an argument’s weight
by increasing the evidence ought to be pushed. We may argue that,
when our knowledge is slight but capable of increase, the course of
action, which will, relative to such knowledge, probably produce the
greatest amount of good, will often consist in the acquisition of more
knowledge. But there clearly comes a point when it is no longer
worth while to spend trouble, before acting, in the acquisition of
further information, and there is no evident principle by which to
determine how far we ought to carry our maxim of strengthening the
*See also Chapter XXVI. § 7.
†Cf. Locke, Essay concerning Human Understanding, book ii. chap. xxi. § 67:
“He that judges without informing himself to the utmost that he is capable,
cannot acquit himself of judging amiss.”
ch. vi FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 85
weight of our argument. A little reflection will probably convince the
reader that this is a very confusing problem.
8. The fundamental distinction of this chapter may be briefly
repeated. One argument has more weight than another if it is based
upon a greater amount of relevant evidence; but it is not always, or
even generally, possible to say of two sets of propositions that one set
embodies more evidence than the other. It has a greater probability
than another if the balance in its favour, of what evidence there is,
is greater than the balance in favour of the argument with which we
compare it; but it is not always, or even generally, possible to say
that the balance in the one case is greater than the balance in the
other. The weight, to speak metaphorically, measures the sum of the
favourable and unfavourable evidence, the probability measures the
difference.
9. The phenomenon of ‘weight’ can be described from the
point of view of other theories of probability than that which is
adopted here. If we follow certain German logicians in regarding
probability as being based on the disjunctive judgment, we may
say that the weight is increased when the number of alternatives
is reduced, although the ratio of the number of favourable to the
number of unfavourable alternatives may not have been disturbed; or,
to adopt the phraseology of another German school, we may say that
the weight of the probability is increased, as the field of possibility is
contracted.
The same distinction may be explained in the language of the
frequency theory.* We should then say that the weight is increased
if we are able to employ as the class of reference a class which is
contained in the original class of reference.
10. The subject of this chapter has not usually been discussed by
writers on probability, and I know of only two by whom the question
has been explicitly raised:† Meinong, who threw out a suggestion at
*See Chap. VIII.
†There are also some remarks by Czuber (Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, vol. i.

the conclusion of his review of Von Kries’ “Principien,” published in
the Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen for 1890 (see especially pp. 70–74),
and A. Nitsche, who took up Meinong’s suggestion in an article in the
Vierteljahrsschrift für wissenschaftliche Philosophie, 1892, vol. xvi.
pp. 20–35, entitled “Die Dimensionen der Wahrscheinlichkeit und die
Evidenz der Ungewissheit.”
Meinong, who does not develop the point in any detail, distinguishes
probability and weight as ‘Intensität’ and ‘Qualität,’ and is
inclined to regard them as two independent dimensions in which
the judgment is free to move—they are the two dimensions of the
‘Urteils-Continuum.’ Nitsche regards the weight as being the measure
of the reliability (Sicherheit) of the probability, and holds that the
probability continually approximates to its true magnitude (reale
Geltung) as the weight increases. His treatment is too brief for it to
be possible to understand very clearly what he means, but his view
seems to resemble the theory already discussed that an argument of
high weight is ‘more likely to be right’ than one of low weight.

CHAPTER VII
historical retrospect
1. The characteristic features of our Philosophy of Probability
must be determined by the solutions which we offer to the problems
attacked in Chapters III and IV. Whilst a great part of the logical
calculus, which will be developed in Part II., would be applicable
with slight modification to several distinct theories of the subject, the
ultimate problems of establishing the premisses of the calculus bring
into the light every fundamental difference of opinion.
These problems are often, for this reason perhaps, left on one side
by writers whose interest chiefly lies in the more formal parts of the
subject. But Probability is not yet on so sound a basis that the formal
or mathematical side of it can be safely developed in isolation, and
some attempts have naturally been made to solve the problem which
Bishop Butler sets to the logician in the concluding words of the brief
discussion on probability with which he prefaces the Analogy.
*
In this chapter, therefore, we will review in their historical order
the answers of Philosophy to the questions, how we know relations
of probability, what ground we have for our judgments, and by what
method we can advance our knowledge.
2. The natural man is disposed to the opinion that probability
is essentially connected with the inductions of experience and, if he
is a little more sophisticated, with the Laws of Causation and of the
Uniformity of Nature. As Aristotle says, “the probable is that which
usually happens.” Events do not always occur in accordance with
*
“It is not my design to inquire further into the nature, the foundation and
measure of probability; or whence it proceeds that likeness should beget that
presumption, opinion and full conviction, which the human mind is formed to
receive from it, and which it does necessarily produce in every one; or to guard
against the errors to which reasoning from analogy is liable. This belongs to the
subject of logic, and is a part of that subject which has not yet been thoroughly
considered.”

the expectations of experience; but the laws of experience afford us
a good ground for supposing that they usually will. The occasional
disappointment of these expectations prevents our predictions from
being more than probable; but the ground of their probability must
be sought in this experience, and in this experience only.
This is, in substance, the argument of the authors of the Port
Royal Logic (1662), who were the first to deal with the logic of
probability in the modern manner: “In order for me to judge of the
truth of an event, and to be determined to believe it or not believe
it, it is not necessary to consider it abstractly, and in itself, as we
should consider a proposition in geometry; but it is necessary to pay
attention to all the circumstances which accompany it, internal as
well as external. I call internal circumstances those which belong to
the fact itself, and external those which belong to the persons by
whose testimony we are led to believe it. This being done, if all
the circumstances are such that it never or rarely happens that the
like circumstances are the concomitants of falsehood, our mind is led,
naturally, to believe that it is true.” * Locke follows the Port Royal
Logicians very closely: “Probability is likeliness to be true. . . . The
grounds of it are, in short, these two following. First, the conformity
of anything with our own knowledge, observation, and experience.
Secondly, the testimony of others, vouching their observation and
experience”;† and essentially the same opinion is maintained by Bishop
Butler: “When we determine a thing to be probably true, suppose
that an event has or will come to pass, it is from the mind’s remarking
in it a likeness to some other event, which we have observed has
come to pass. And this observation forms, in numberless instances, a
presumption, opinion, or full conviction that such event has or will
come to pass.” ‡

ch. vii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 89
Against this view of the subject the criticisms of Hume were
directed: “The idea of cause and effect is derived from experience,
which informs us, that such particular objects, in all past instances,
have been constantly conjoined with each other. . . . According to
this account of things . . . probability is founded on the presumption
of a resemblance betwixt those objects, of which we have had
experience, and those, of which we have had none; and therefore
’tis impossible this presumption can arise from probability.” *
“When
we are accustomed to see two impressions conjoined together, the
appearance or idea of the one immediately carries us to the idea of
the other. . . . Thus all probable reasoning is nothing but a species of
sensation. ’Tis not solely in poetry and music, we must follow our
taste and sentiment, but likewise in philosophy. When I am convinced
of any principle, ’tis only an idea, which strikes more strongly upon
me. When I give the preference to one set of arguments above
another, I do nothing but decide from my feeling concerning the
superiority of their influence.” † Hume, in fact, points out that, while
it is true that past experience gives rise to a psychological anticipation
of some events rather than of others, no ground has been given for
the validity of this superior anticipation.
3. But in the meantime the subject had fallen into the hands
of the mathematicians, and an entirely new method of approach was
in course of development. It had become obvious that many of the
judgments of probability which we in fact make do not depend upon
past experience in a way which satisfies the canons laid down by
the Port Royal Logicians or by Locke. In particular, alternatives are
judged equally probable, without there being necessarily any actual
experience of their approximately equal frequency of occurrence in
the past. And, apart from this, it is evident that judgments based
on a somewhat indefinite experience of the past do not easily lend
themselves to precise numerical appraisement. Accordingly James
*Treatise of Human Nature, p. 391 (Green’s edition).
†Op. cit. p. 403.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 90
Bernoulli,*
the real founder of the classical school of mathematical
probability, while not repudiating the old test of experience, had
based many of his conclusions on a quite different criterion—the rule
which I have named the Principle of Indifference. The traditional
method of the mathematical school essentially depends upon reducing
all the possible conclusions to a number of ‘equiprobable cases.’ And,
according to the Principle of Indifference, ‘cases’ are held to be
equiprobable when there is no reason for preferring any one to any
other, when there is nothing, as with Buridan’s ass, to determine the
mind in any one of the several possible directions. To take Czuber’s
example of dice,†
this principle permits us to assume that each face
is equally likely to fall, if there is no reason to suppose any particular
irregularity, and it does not require that we should know that the
construction is regular, or that each face has, as a matter of fact,
fallen equally often in the past.
On this Principle, extended by Bernoulli beyond those problems
of gaming in which by its tacit assumption Pascal and Huyghens had
worked out a few simple exercises, the whole fabric of mathematical
probability was soon allowed to rest. The older criterion of experience,
never repudiated, was soon subsumed under the new doctrine. First,
in virtue of Bernoulli’s famous Law of Great Numbers, the fractions
representing the probabilities of events were thought to represent
also the actual proportion of their occurrences, so that experience,
if it were considerable, could be translated into the cyphers of
arithmetic. And next, by the aid of the Principle of Indifference,
Laplace established his Law of Succession by which the influence of
any experience, however limited, could be numerically measured, and
which purported to prove that, if B has been seen to accompany A
twice, it is two to one that B will again accompany A on A’s next
appearance. No other formula in the alchemy of logic has exerted

ch. vii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 91
more astonishing powers, For it has established the existence of
God from the premiss of total ignorance; and it has measured with
numerical precision the probability that the sun will rise to-morrow.
Yet the new principles did not win acceptance without opposition.
D’Alembert,* Hume, and Ancillon†
stand out as the sceptical critics
of probability, against the credulity of eighteenth-century philosophers
who were ready to swallow without too many questions the conclusions
of a science which claimed and seemed to bring an entire new field
within the dominion of Reason.‡
The first effective criticism came from Hume, who was also the
first to distinguish the method of Locke and the philosophers from
the method of Bernoulli and the mathematicians. “Probability,” he
says, “or reasoning from conjecture, may be divided into two kinds,
viz. that which is founded on chance and that which arises from
causes.” § By these two kinds he evidently means the mathematical
method of counting the equal chances based on Indifference, and the
*D’Alembert’s scepticism was directed towards the current mathematical
theory only, and was not, like Hume’s, fundamental and far-reaching.
His opposition to the received opinions was, perhaps, more splendid than
discriminating.
†Ancillon’s communication to the Berlin Academy in 1794, entitled Doutes
sur les bases du calcul des probabilités, is not as well known as it deserves to be.
He writes as a follower of Hume, but adds much that is original and interesting.
An historian, who also wrote on a variety of philosophical subjects, Ancillon
was, at one time, the Prussian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
‡French philosophy of the latter half of the eighteenth century was profoundly
affected by the supposed conquests of the Calculus of Probability in all fields
of thought. Nothing seemed beyond its powers of prediction, and it almost
succeeded in men’s minds to the place previously occupied by Revelation. It was
under these influences that Condorcet evolved his doctrine of the perfectibility of
the human race. The continuity and oneness of modern European thought may
be illustrated, if such things amuse the reader, by the reflection that Condorcet
derived from Bernoulli, that Godwin was inspired by Condorcet, that Malthus
was stimulated by Godwin’s folly into stating his famous doctrine, and that
from the reading of Malthus on Population Darwin received his earliest impulse.
§Treatise of Human Nature, p. 424 (Green’s edition).
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 92
inductive method based on the experience of uniformity. He argues
that ‘chance’ alone can be the foundation of nothing, and “that there
must always be a mixture of causes among the chances, in order to
be the foundation of any reasoning.” * His previous argument against
probabilities, which were based on an assumption of cause, is thus
extended to the mathematical method also.
But the great prestige of Laplace and the ‘verifications’ of his
principles which his more famous results were supposed to supply had,
by the beginning of the nineteenth century, established the science
on the Principle of Indifference in an almost unquestioned position.
It may be noted, however, that De Morgan, the principal student of
the subject in England, seems to have regarded the method of actual
experiment and the method of counting cases, which were equally
probable on grounds of Indifference, as alternative methods of equal
validity.
4. The reaction against the traditional teaching during the
past hundred years has not possessed sufficient force to displace the
established doctrine, and the Principle of Indifference is still very
widely accepted in an unqualified form. Criticism has proceeded along
two distinct lines; the one, originated by Leslie Ellis, and developed
by Dr. Venn, Professor Edgeworth, and Professor Karl Pearson, has
been almost entirely confined in its influence to England; the other,
of which the beginnings are to be seen in Boole’s Laws of Thought,
has been developed in Germany, where its ablest exponent has been
Von Kries. France has remained uninfluenced by either, and faithful,
on the whole, to the tradition of Laplace. Even Henri Poincaré, who
had his doubts, and described the Principle of Indifference as “very
vague and very elastic,” regarded it as our only guide in the choice
of that convention, “which has always something arbitrary about it,”
*Op. cit. p. 425.
ch. vii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 93
but upon which calculation in probability invariably rests.*
5. Before following up in detail these two lines of development,
I will summarise again the earlier doctrine with which the leaders of
the new schools found themselves confronted.
The earlier philosophers had in mind in dealing with probability
the application to the future of the inductions of experience, to
the almost complete exclusion of other problems. For the data of
probability, therefore, they looked only to their own experience and
to the recorded experiences of others; their principal refinement was
to distinguish these two grounds, and they did not attempt to make
a numerical estimate of the chances. The mathematicians, on the
other hand, setting out from the simple problems presented by dice
and playing cards, and requiring for the application of their methods
a basis of numerical measurement, dwelt on the negative rather than
the positive side of their evidence, and found it easier to measure
equal degrees of ignorance than equivalent quantities of experience.
This led to the explicit introduction of the Principle of Indifference,
*Poincaré’s opinions on Probability are to be found in his Calcul des
Probabilités and in his Science et Hypothèse. Neither of these books appears
to me to be in all respects a considered work, but his view is sufficiently
novel to be worth a reference. Briefly, he shows that the current mathematical
definition is circular, and argues from this that the choice of the particular
probabilities, which we are to regard as initially equal before the application
of our mathematics, is entirely a matter of ‘convention.’ Much epigram is,
therefore, expended in pointing out that the study of probability is no more
than a polite exercise, and he concludes: “Le calcul des probabilités offre
une contradiction dans les termes mêmes qui servent à le désigner, et, si je
ne craignais de rappeler ici un mot trop souvent répété, je dirais qu’il nous
enseigne surtout une chose; c’est de savoir que nous ne savons rien.” On the
other hand, the greater part of his book is devoted to working out instances
of practical application, and he speaks of ‘metaphysics’ legitimising particular
conventions. How this comes about is not explained. He seems to endeavour to
save his reputation as a philosopher by the surrender of probability as a valid
conception, without at the same time forfeiting his claim as a mathematician to
work out probable formulae of practical importance.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 94
or, as it was then termed, the Principle of Non-Sufficient Reason.
The great achievement of the eighteenth century was, in the eyes of
the early nineteenth, the reconciliation of the two points of view and
the measurement of probabilities, which were grounded on experience,
by a method whose logical basis was the Principle of Non-Sufficient
Reason. This would indeed have been a very astonishing discovery,
and would, as its authors declared, have gradually brought almost
every phase of human activity within the power of the most refined
mathematical analysis.
But it was not long before more sceptical persons began to suspect
that this theory proved too much. Its calculations, it is true, were
constructed from the data of experience, but the more simple and the
less complex the experience the better satisfied was the theory. What
was required was not a wide experience or detailed information, but
a completeness of symmetry in the little information there might be.
It seemed to follow from the Laplacian doctrine that the primary
qualification for one who would be well informed was an equally
balanced ignorance.
6. The obvious reaction from a teaching, which seemed to derive
from abstractions results relevant to experience, was into the arms
of empiricism; and in the state of philosophy at that time England
was the natural home of this reaction. The first protest, of which
I am aware, came from Leslie Ellis in 1842.* At the conclusion
of his Remarks on an alleged proof of the Method of least squares,
†
“Mere ignorance,” he says, “is no ground for any inference whatever.
Ex nihilo nihil.” In Venn’s Logic of Chance Ellis’s suggestions are
developed into a complete theory:‡
“Experience is our sole guide.
If we want to discover what is in reality a series of things, not
a series of our own conceptions, we must appeal to the things
themselves to obtain it, for we cannot find much help elsewhere.”
*On the Foundations of the Theory of Probabilities.
†Republished in Miscellaneous Writings.
‡Logic of Chance, p. 74.
ch. vii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 95
Professor Edgeworth* was an early disciple of the same school: “The
probability,” he says, “of head occurring n times if the coin is of
the ordinary make is approximately at least (
1
2
)
n
. This value is
rigidly deducible from positive experience, the observations made by
gamesters, the experiments recorded by Jevons and De Morgan.”
The doctrines of the empirical school will be examined in Chapter
VIII., and I postpone my detailed criticism to that chapter. Venn
rejects the applications of Bernoulli’s theorem, which he describes as
“one of the last remaining relics of Realism,” as well as the later
Laplacian Law of Succession, thus destroying the link between the
empirical and the à priori methods. But, apart from this, his
view that statements of probability are simply a particular class of
statements about the actual world of phenomena, would have led
him to a closer dependence on actual experience. He holds that
the probability of an event’s having a certain attribute is simply the
fraction expressing the proportion of cases in which, as a matter of
actual fact, this attribute is present. Our knowledge, however, of this
proportion is often reached inductively, and shares the uncertainty to
which all inductions are liable. And, besides, in referring an event to
a series we do not postulate that all the members of the series should
be identical, but only that they should not be known to differ in a
relevant manner. Even on this theory, therefore, we are not solely
determined by positive knowledge and the direct data of experience.
7. The Empirical School in their reaction against the pretentious
results, which the Laplacian theory affected to develop out of nothing,
have gone too far in the opposite direction. If our experience and
our knowledge were complete, we should be beyond the need of the
Calculus of Probability. And where our experience is incomplete, we
cannot hope to derive from it judgments of probability without the aid
either of intuition or of some further à priori principle. Experience, as
opposed to intuition, cannot possibly afford us a criterion by which to
*Metretike, p. 4.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 96
judge whether on given evidence the probabilities of two propositions
are or are not equal.
However essential the data of experience may be, they cannot by
themselves, it seems, supply us with what we want. Czuber,* who
prefers what he calls the Principle of Compelling Reason (das Prinzip
des zwingenden Grundes), and holds that Probability has an objective
and not merely formal interpretation only when it is grounded on
definite knowledge, is rightly compelled to admit that we cannot get
on altogether without the Principle of Non-Sufficient Reason. On the
grounds both of its own intuitive plausibility and of that of some of
the conclusions for which it is necessary, we are inevitably led towards
this principle as a necessary basis for judgments of probability. In
some sense, judgments of probability do seem to be based on equally
balanced degrees of ignorance.
8. It is from this starting-point that the German logicians
have set out. They have perceived that there are few judgments
of probability which are altogether independent of some principle
resembling that of Non-Sufficient Reason. But they also apprehend,
with Boole, that this may be a very arbitrary method of procedure.
It was pointed out in § 18 of Chapter IV. that the cases,
in which the Principle of Indifference (or Non-Sufficient Reason)
breaks down, have a great deal in common, and that we break up
the field of possibility into a number of areas, actually unequal,
but indistinguishable on the evidence. Several German logicians,
therefore, have endeavoured to determine some rule by which it might
be possible to postulate actual equality of area for the fields of the
various possibilities.
By far the most complete and closely reasoned solution on these
lines is that of Von Kries.† He is primarily anxious to discover a
proper basis for the numerical measurement of probabilities, and he
*Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, p. 11.
†Die Principien der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung. Eine logische Untersuchung.
Freiburg, 1886.
ch. vii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 97
is thus led to examine with care the grounds of valid judgments
of equiprobability. His criticisms of the Principle of Non-Sufficient
Reason are searching, and, to meet them, he elaborates a number of
qualifying conditions which are, he argues, necessary and sufficient.
The value of his book, however, lies, in the opinion of the present
writer, in the critical rather than in the constructive parts. The
manner in which his qualifying conditions are expressed is often,
to an English reader at any rate, somewhat obscure, and he seems
sometimes to cover up difficulties, rather than solve them, by the
invention of new technical terms. These characteristics render it
difficult to expound him adequately in a summary, and the reader
must be referred to the original for a proper exposition of the
Doctrine of Spielräume. Briefly, but not very intelligibly perhaps,
he may be said to hold that the hypotheses for the probabilities of
which we wish to obtain a numerical comparison, must refer to ‘fields’
(Spielräume) which are ‘indifferent,’ ‘comparable’ in magnitude, and
‘original’ (ursprünglich). Two fields are ‘indifferent’ if they are equal
before the Principle of Non-Sufficient Reason; they are ‘comparable’
if it is true that the fields are actually of equal extent; and they are
‘original’ or ultimate if they are not derived from some other field.
The last condition is exceedingly obscure, but it seems to mean that
the objects with which we are ultimately dealing must be directly
represented by the ‘fields’ of our hypotheses, and there must not be
merely correlation between these objects and the objects of the fields.
The qualification of comparability is intended to deal with difficulties
such as that connected with the population of different areas of
unknown extent; and the qualification of originality with those arising
from indirect measurement, as in the case of specific density.
Von Kries’s solution is highly suggestive, but it does not seem, so
far as I understand it, to supply an unambiguous criterion for all cases.
His discussion of the philosophical character of probability is brief and
inadequate, and the fundamental error in his treatment of the subject
is the physical, rather than logical, bias which seems to direct the
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 98
formulation of his conditions. The condition of Ursprünglichkeit, for
instance, seems to depend upon physical rather than logical criteria,
and is, as a result, much more restricted in its applicability than a
condition, which will really meet the difficulties of the case, ought to
be. But, although I differ from him in his philosophical conception of
probability, the treatment of the Principle of Indifference, which fills
the greater part of his book, is, I think, along fruitful lines, and I
have been deeply indebted to it in formulating my own conditions in
Chapter IV.
Of less closely reasoned and less detailed treatments, which aim
at the same kind of result, those of Sigwart and Lotze are worth
noticing. Sigwart’s* position is sufficiently explained by the following
extract: “The possibility of a mathematical treatment lies primarily
in the fact that in the disjunctive judgment the number of terms
in the disjunction plays a decisive part. Inasmuch as a limited
number of mutually exclusive possibilities is presented, of which one
alone is actual, the element of number forms an essential part of our
knowledge. . . . Our knowledge must enable us to assume that the
particular terms of the disjunction are so far equivalent that they
express an equal degree of specialisation of a general concept, or that
they cover equal parts of the whole extension of the concept. . . . This
equivalence is most intuitable where we are dealing with equal parts
of a spatial area, or equal parts of a period of time. . . . But even
where this obvious quality is not forthcoming, we may ground our
expectations upon a hypothetical equivalence, where we see no reason
for considering the extent of one possibility to be greater than that
of the others. . . .”
In the beginning of this passage Sigwart seems to be aware of
the fundamental difficulty, although exception may be taken to the
vagueness of the phrase “equal degree of specialisation of a general
concept.” But in the last sentence quoted he surrenders the advantages
*Sigwart Logic (Eng. edition), vol. ii. p. 220.
ch. vii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 99
he has gained in the earlier part of his explanation, and, instead of
insisting on a knowledge of an equal degree of specialisation, he is
satisfied with an absence of any knowledge to the contrary. Hence, in
spite of his initial qualifications, he ends unrestrainedly in the arms
of Non-Sufficient Reason.*
Lotze,†
in a brief discussion of the subject, throws out some
remarks well worth quoting: “We disclaim all knowledge of the
circumstances which condition the real issue, so that when we talk
of equally possible cases we can only mean coördinated as equivalent
species in the compass of an universal case; that is to say, if we
enumerate the special forms, which the genus can assume, we get a
disjunctive judgment of the form: if the condition B is fulfilled, one
of the kinds f1f2f3 . . . of the universal consequent F will occur to the
exclusion of the rest. Which of all those different consequents will,
in fact, occur, depends in all cases on the special form b1b2b3 . . . in
which that universal condition is fulfilled. . . . A coördinated case is
a case which answers to one and only one of the mutually exclusive
values b1b2 . . . of the condition B, and these rival values may occur in
reality; it does not answer to a more general form B, of this condition,
which can never exist in reality, because it embraces several of the
particular values b1b2. . . .”
This certainly meets some of the difficulties, and its resemblance
to the conditions formulated in Chapter IV. will be evident to the
careful reader. But it is not very precise, and not easily applicable
to all cases, to those, for instance, of the measurement of continuous
quantity. By combining the suggestions of Von Kries, Sigwart, and
Lotze, we might, perhaps, patch up a fairly comprehensive rule. We
might say, for instance, that if b1 and b2 are classes, their members
must be finite in number and enumerable or they must compose
*Sigwart’s treatment of the subject of probability is curiously inaccurate. Of
his four fundamental rules of probability, for instance, three are, as he states
them, certainly false.

pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 100
stretches; that, if they are finite in number, they must be equal in
number; and that, if their members compose stretches, the stretches
must be equal stretches; and that if b1 and b2 are concepts, they
must represent concepts of an equal degree of specialisation. But
qualifications so worded would raise almost as many difficulties as
they solved. How, for instance, are we to know when concepts are of
an equal degree of specialisation?
9. That probability is a relation has often received incidental
recognition from logicians, in spite of the general failure to place
proper emphasis on it. The earliest writer, with whom I am
acquainted, explicitly to notice this, is Kahle in his Elementa logicae
Probabilium methodo mathematica in usum Scientiarum et Vitae
adornata published at Halle in 1735.* Amongst more recent writers
casual statements are common to the effect that the probability of a
conclusion is relative to the grounds upon which it is based. Take
Boole†
for instance: “It is implied in the definition that probability
is always relative to our actual state of information and varies with
*This work, which seems to have soon fallen into complete neglect and
is now extremely rare, is full of interest and original thought. The following
quotations will show the fundamental position taken up: “Est cognitio probabilis,
si desunt quaedam requisita ad veritatem demonstrativam (p. 15). Propositio
probabilis esse potest falsa, et improbabilis esse potest vera; ergo cognitio
hodie possibilis, crastina luce mutari potest improbabilem, si accedunt reliqua
requisita omnia, in certitudinem (p. 26). . . . Certitudo est terminus relativus:

est scientia dijudicandi gradum certitudinis eorum, quibus desunt requisita ad

which progress has seemed possible, with the hope that it may assist
the reader, who is dissatisfied with the solution proposed in Chapter
IV., to determine the line of argument along which he is likeliest to
discover the solution of a difficult problem.

CHAPTER VIII
the frequency theory of probability
1. The theory of probability, outlined in the preceding chapters,
has serious difficulties to overcome. There is a theoretical, as well as a
practical, difficulty in measuring or comparing degrees of probability,
and a further difficulty in determining them à priori. We must
now examine an alternative theory which is much freer from these
troubles, and is widely held at the present time.
2. The theory is in its essence a very old one, Aristotle
foreshadowed it when he held that “the probable is that which for
the most part happens”;* and, as we have seen in Chapter VII., an
opinion not unlike this was entertained by those philosophers of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries who approached the problems
of probability uninfluenced by the work of mathematicians. But the
underlying conception of earlier writers received at the hands of some
English logicians during the latter half of the nineteenth century a
new and much more complicated form.
The theory in question, which I shall call the Frequency Theory
of Probability, first appears† as the basis of a proposed logical
scheme in a brief essay by Leslie Ellis On the Foundations of the
Theory of Probabilities, and is somewhat further developed in his
Remarks on the Fundamental Principles of the Theory of Probabilities.

I give Ellis the priority because his paper, published in 1843, was read
on Feb. 14, 1842. The same conception, however, is to be found in Cournot’s
Exposition, also published in 1843: “La théorie des probabilités a pour objet
certains rapports numériques qui prendraient des valeurs fixes et complétement
déterminées, si l’on pouvait répéter à l’infini les épreuves des mêmes hasards, et
qui, pour un nombre fini d’épreuves, oscillent entre des limites d’autant plus
resserées, d’autant plus voisines des valeurs finales, que le nombre des épreuves
est plus grand.”

ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 103
“If the probability of a given event be correctly determined,” he
says, “the event will on a long run of trials tend to recur with
frequency proportional to their probability. This is generally proved
mathematically. It seems to me to be true à priori. . . . I have been
unable to sever the judgment that one event is more likely to happen
than another from the belief that in the long run it will occur more
frequently.” Ellis explicitly introduces the conception that probability
is essentially concerned with a group or series.
Although the priority of invention must be allowed to Leslie
Ellis, the theory is commonly associated with the name of Venn.
In his Logic of Chance*
it first received elaborate and systematic
treatment, and, in spite of his having attracted a number of followers,
there has been no other comprehensive attempt to meet the theory’s
special difficulties or the criticisms directed against it. I shall begin,
therefore, by examining it in the form in which Venn has expounded
it. Venn’s exposition is much coloured by an empirical view of logic,
which is not perhaps as necessary to the essential part of his doctrine
as he himself implies, and is not shared by all of those who must
be classed as in general agreement with him about probability. It
will be necessary, therefore, to supplement a criticism of Venn by an
account of a more general frequency theory of probability, divested of
the empiricism with which he has clothed it.
3. The following quotations from Venn’s Logic of Chance
will show the general drift of his argument: The fundamental
conception is that of a series (p. 4). The series is of events which
have a certain number of features or attributes in common (p. 10).
The characteristic distinctive of probability is this,—the occasional
the first in 1843 (vol. viii.), and the second in 1854 (vol. ix.). Both were
reprinted in Mathematical and other Writings (1863), together with three other
brief papers on Probability and the Method of Least Squares. All five are full
of spirit and originality, and are not now so well known as they deserve to be.
*The first edition appeared in 1866. Revised editions were issued in 1876
and 1888. References are given to the third edition of 1888.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 104
attributes, as distinguished from the permanent, are found on an
examination to tend to exist in a certain definite proportion of the
whole number of cases (p. 11). We require that there should be in
nature large classes of objects, throughout all the individual members
of which a general resemblance extends. For this purpose the existence
of natural kinds or groups is necessary (p. 55). The distinctive
characteristics of probability prevail principally in the properties of
natural kinds, both in the ultimate and in the derivative or accidental
properties (p. 63). The same peculiarity prevails again in the force
and frequency of most natural agencies (p. 64). There seems reason
to believe that it is in such things only, as distinguished from things
artificial, that the property in question is to be found (p. 65). How, in
any particular case, are we to establish the existence of a probability
series? Experience is our sole guide. If we want to discover what
is in reality a series of things, not a series of our own conceptions,
we must appeal to the things themselves to obtain it, for we cannot
find much help elsewhere (p. 174). When probability is divorced from
direct reference to objects, as it substantially is by not being founded
upon experience, it simply resolves itself into the common algebraical
doctrine of Permutations and Combinations (p. 87). By assigning
an expectation in reference to the individual, we mean nothing more
than to make a statement about the average of his class (p. 151).
When we say of a conclusion within the strict province of probability,
that it is not certain, all that we mean is that in some proportion of
cases only will such conclusion be right, in the other cases it will be
wrong (p. 210).
The essence of this theory can be expressed in a few words. To
say, that the probability of an event’s having a certain characteristic
is x
y
, is to mean that the event is one of a number of events, a
proportion x
y
of which have the characteristic in question; and the
fact, that there is such a series of events possessing this frequency in
respect of the characteristic, is purely a matter of experience to be
determined in the same manner as any other question of fact. That
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 105
such series do exist happens to be a characteristic of the real world as
we know it, and from this the practical importance of the calculation
of probabilities is derived.
Such a theory possesses manifest advantages. There is no mystery
about it—no new indefinables, no appeals to intuition. Measurement
leads to no difficulties; our probabilities or frequencies are ordinary
numbers, upon which the arithmetical apparatus can be safely brought
to bear. And at the same time it seems to crystallise in a clear,
explicit shape the floating opinion of common sense that an event is
or is not probable in certain supposed circumstances according as it
is or is not usual as a matter of fact and experience.
The two principal tenets, then, of Venn’s system are these,—that
probability is concerned with series or groups of events, and that
all the requisite facts must be determined empirically, a statement
in probability merely summing up in a convenient way a group of
experiences. Aggregate regularity combined with individual difference
happens, he says, to be characteristic of many events in the real world.
It will often be the case, therefore, that we can make statements
regarding the average of a certain class, or regarding its characteristics
in the long run, which we cannot make about any of its individual
members without great risk of error. As our knowledge regarding the
class as a whole may give us valuable guidance in dealing with an
individual instance, we require a convenient way of saying that an
individual belongs to a class in which certain characteristics appear
on the average with a known frequency; and this the conventional
language of probability gives us. The importance of probability
depends solely upon the actual existence of such groups or real kinds
in the world of experience, and a judgment of probability must
necessarily depend for its validity upon our empirical knowledge of
them.
4. It is the obvious, as well as the correct, criticism of such a
theory, that the identification of probability with statistical frequency
is a very grave departure from the established use of words; for it
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 106
clearly excludes a great number of judgments which are generally
believed to deal with probability. Venn himself was well aware of
this, and cannot be accused of supposing that all beliefs, which
are commonly called probable, are really concerned with statistical
frequency. But some of his followers, to judge from their published
work, have not always seen, so clearly as he did, that his theory is
not concerned with the same subject as that with which other writers
have dealt under the same title. Venn justifies his procedure by
arguing that no other meaning, of which it is possible to take strict
logical cognisance, can reasonably be given to the term, and that the
other meanings, with which it has been used, have not enough in
common to permit their reduction to a single logical scheme. It is
useless, therefore, for a critic of Venn to point out that many supposed
judgments of probability are not concerned with statistical frequency;
for, as I understand the Logic of Chance, he admits it; and the critic
must show that the sense different from Venn’s in which the term
probability is often employed has an important logical interpretation
about which we can generalise. This position I seek to establish. It is,
in my opinion, this other sense alone which has importance; Venn’s
theory by itself has few practical applications, and if we allow it to
hold the field, we must admit that probability is not the guide of life,
and that in following it we are not acting according to reason.
5. Part of the plausibility of Venn’s theory is derived, I think,
from a failure to recognise the narrow limits of its applicability, or
to notice his own admissions regarding this. “In every case,” he says
(p. 124), “in which we extend our inferences by Induction or Analogy,
or depend upon the witness of others, or trust to our own memory
of the past, or come to a conclusion through conflicting arguments,
or even make a long and complicated deduction by mathematics or
logic, we have a result of which we can scarcely feel as certain as of
the premisses from which it was obtained. In all these cases, then,
we are conscious of varying quantities of belief, but are the laws
according to which the belief is produced and varied the same? If
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 107
they cannot be reduced to one harmonious scheme, if, in fact, they
can at best be brought to nothing but a number of different schemes,
each with its own body of laws and rules, then it is vain to endeavour
to force them into one science.” All these cases, therefore, in which
we are ‘not certain,’ Venn explicitly excludes from what he chooses
to call the science of probability, and he pays no further attention to
them. The science of probability is, according to him, no more than
a method which enables us to express in a convenient form statistical
statements of frequency. “The province of probability,” he says again
on page 160, “is not so extensive as that over which variation of belief
might be observed. Probability only considers the case in which this
variation is brought about in a certain definite statistical way.” * He
points out on p. 194 that for the purposes of probability we must take
the statistical frequency from which we start ready made and ask no
questions about the process or completeness of its manufacture: “It
may be obtained by any of the numerous rules furnished by Induction,
or it may be inferred deductively, or given by our own observation;
its value may be diminished by its depending upon the testimony of
witnesses, or its being recalled by our own memory. Its real value may
be influenced by these causes or any combinations of them; but all
these are preliminary questions with which we have nothing directly
to do. We assume our statistical proposition to be true, neglecting
*Edgeworth uses the term ‘probability’ widely, as I do; but he makes
a distinction corresponding to Venn’s by limiting the subject-matter of the
Calculus of Probabilities. He writes (‘Philosophy of Chance,’ Mind, 1884,
p. 223): “The Calculus of Probabilities is concerned with the estimation of
degrees of probability; not every species of estimate, but that which is founded
on a particular standard. That standard is the phenomenon of statistical
uniformity: the fact that a genus can very frequently be subdivided into species
such that the number of individuals in each species bears an approximately
constant ratio to the number of individuals in the genus.” This use of terms is
legitimate, though it is not easy to follow it consistently. But, like Venn’s, it
leaves aside the most important questions. The Calculus of Probabilities, thus
interpreted, is no guide by itself as to which opinion we ought to follow, and is
not a measure of the weight we should attach to conflicting arguments.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 108
the diminution of its value by the processes of attainment.”
It must be recognised, therefore, that Venn has deliberately
excluded from his survey almost all the cases in which we regard our
judgments as ‘only probable’; and, whatever the value or consistency
of his own scheme, he has left untouched a wide field of study for
others.
6. The main grounds, which have induced Venn to regard
judgments based on statistical frequency as the only cases of
probability which possess logical importance, seem to be two: (i.) that
other cases are mainly subjective, and (ii.) that they are incapable of
accurate measurement.
With regard to the first it must be admitted that there are
many instances in which variation of belief is occasioned by purely
psychological causes, and that his argument is valid against those
who have defined probability as measuring the degree of subjective
belief. But this has not been the usual way of looking at the subject.
Probability is the study of the grounds which lead us to entertain a
rational preference for one belief over another. That there are rational
grounds other than statistical frequency, for such preferences, Venn
does not deny; he admits in the quotation given above that the ‘real
value’ of our conclusion is influenced by many other considerations
than that of statistical frequency. Venn’s theory, therefore, cannot be
fairly propounded by his disciples as alternative to such a theory as
is propounded here. For my Treatise is concerned with the general
theory of arguments from premisses leading to conclusions which are
reasonable but not certain; and this is a subject which Venn has,
deliberately, not treated in the Logic of Chance.
7. Apart from two circumstances, it would scarcely be necessary
to say anything further; but in the first place some writers have
believed that Venn has propounded a complete theory of probability,
failing to realise that he is not at all concerned with the sense in
which we may say that one induction or analogy, or testimony, or
memory, or train of argument is more probable than another; and in
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 109
the second place he himself has not always kept within the narrow
limits, which he has himself laid down as proper to his theory.
For he has not remained content with defining a probability as
identical with a statistical frequency, but has often spoken as if his
theory told us which alternatives it is reasonable to prefer. When he
states, for instance, that modality ought to be banished from Logic
and relegated to Probability (p. 296), he forgets his own dictum
that of premisses, the distinctive characteristic of which is their lack
of certainty, Probability takes account of one class only, Induction
concerning itself with another class, and so forth (p. 321). He forgets
also that, when he comes to consider the practical use of statistical
frequencies, he has to admit that an event may possess more than
one frequency, and that we must decide which of these to prefer on
extraneous grounds (p. 213). The device, he says, must be to a great
extent arbitrary, and there are no logical grounds of decision; but
would he deny that it is often reasonable to found our probability on
one statistical frequency rather than on another? And if our grounds
are reasonable, are they not in an important sense logical?
Even in those cases, therefore, in which we derive our preference
for one alternative over another from a knowledge of statistical
frequencies, a statistical frequency by itself is insufficient to determine
us. We may call a statistical frequency a probability, if we choose; but
the fundamental problem of determining which of several alternatives
is logically preferable still awaits solution. We cannot be content with
the only counsel Venn can offer, that we should choose a frequency
which is derived from a series neither too large nor too small.
The same difficulty, that a probability in Venn’s sense is insufficient
to determine which alternative is logically preferable, arises in another
connection. In most cases the statistical frequency is not given in
experience for certain, but is arrived at by a process of induction, and
inductions, he admits, are not certain. If, in the past, three infants
out of every ten have died in their first four years, induction may
base on this the doubtful assertion, All infants die in that proportion.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 110
But we cannot assert on this ground, as Venn wishes to do, that the
probability of the death of an infant in its first four years is 3
10 ths.
We can say no more than that it is probable (in my sense) that there
is such a probability (in his sense). For the purpose of coming to a
decision we cannot compare the value of this conclusion with that of
others until we know the probability (in my sense) that the statistical
frequency really is 3
10 ths. The cases in which we can determine
the logical value of a conclusion entirely on grounds of statistical
frequency would seem to be extremely few in number.
8. The second main reason which led Venn to develop his
theory is to be found in his belief that probabilities which are based
on statistical frequencies are alone capable of accurate measurement.
The term ‘probabilities,’ he argues, is properly confined to the case
of chances which can be calculated, and all calculable chances can be
made to depend upon statistical frequency. In attempting to establish
this latter contention he is involved in some paradoxical opinions.
“In many cases,” he admits, “it is undoubtedly true that we do not
resort to direct experience at all. If I want to know what is my
chance of holding ten trumps in a game of whist, I do not enquire
how often such a thing has occurred before. . . . In practice, à priori
determination is often easy, whilst à posteriori appeal to experience
would be not merely tedious but utterly impracticable.” But these
cases which are usually based on the Principle of Indifference can,
he maintains, be justified on statistical grounds. In the case of coin
tossing there is a considerable experience of the equally frequent
occurrence of heads and tails; the experience gained in this simple case
is to be extended to the complex cases by “Induction and Analogy.” In
one simple case the result to which the Principle of Indifference would
lead is that which experience recommends. Therefore in complex
cases, where there is no basis of experiment at all, we may assume
that Experience, if experience there was, would speak with the same
voice as Indifference. This is to assert that, because in one case,
where there is no known reason to the contrary, there actually is
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 111
none, therefore in other cases incapable of verification the absence of
known reason to the contrary proves that actually there is none.
The attempt to justify the rules of inverse probability on statistical
grounds I have failed to understand; and after a careful reading, I am
unable to produce an intelligible account of the argument involved in
the latter part of chapter vii. of the Logic of Chance.
*
I am doubtful
whether Venn should not have excluded à posteriori arguments in
probability from his scheme as well as inductive arguments. The
attempt to include them may have been induced by a desire to deal
with all cases in which numerical calculation has been commonly
thought possible.
9. The argument so far has been solely concerned with the
case for the frequency theory developed in the Logic of Chance. The
criticisms which follow will be directed against a more general form
of the same theory which may conceivably have recommended itself
to some readers. It is unfortunate that no adherent of the doctrine,
with the exception of Venn, has attempted to present the theory of it
in detail. Professor Karl Pearson, for instance, probably agrees with
Venn in a general way only, and it is very likely that many of the
foregoing remarks do not apply to his view of probability; but while
I generally disagree with the fundamental premisses upon which his
work in probability and statistics seems to rest, I am not clearly aware
of the nature of the philosophical theory from which he thinks that he
derives them and which makes them appear to him to be satisfactory.
A careful exposition of his logical presuppositions would greatly add
to the completeness of his work. In the meantime it is only possible
to raise general objections to any theory of probability which seeks to
found itself upon the conception of statistical frequency.
*Let the reader, who is acquainted with this chapter, consider what precise
assumption Venn’s reasoning requires on p. 187 in the example which seeks to
show the efficacy of Lord Lister’s antiseptic treatment à posteriori. What is the
‘inevitable assumption about the bags’ when it is translated into the language
of this example?
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 112
The generalised frequency theory which I propose to put forward,
as perhaps representative of what adherents of this doctrine have
in mind, differs from Venn’s in several important respects.*
In the
first place, it does not regard probability as being identical with
statistical frequency, although it holds that all probabilities must be
based on statements of frequency, and can be defined in terms of
them. It accepts the theory that propositions rather than events
should be taken as the subject-matter of probability; and it adopts
the comprehensive view of the subject according to which it includes
induction and all other cases in which we believe that there are
logical grounds for preferring one alternative out of a set none of
which are certain. Nor does it follow Venn in supposing any special
connection to exist between a frequency theory of probability and
logical empiricism.
10. A proposition can be a member of many distinct classes of
propositions, the classes being merely constituted by the existence of
particular resemblances between their members or in some such way.
We may know of a given proposition that it is one of a particular class
of propositions, and we may also know, precisely or within defined
limits, what proportion of this class are true, without our being aware
whether or not the given proposition is true. Let us, therefore, call the
actual proportion of true propositions in a class the truth-frequency†
of the class, and define the measure of the probability of a proposition
relative to a class, of which it is a member, as being equal to the
truth-frequency of the class.
The fundamental tenet of a frequency theory of probability is,
then, that the probability of a proposition always depends upon
referring it to some class whose truth-frequency is known within wide
or narrow limits.
*
In what follows I am much indebted for some suggestions in favour of the
frequency theory communicated to me by Dr. Whitehead; but it is not to be
supposed that the exposition which follows represents his own opinion.
†This is Dr. Whitehead’s phrase.
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 113
Such a theory possesses most of the advantages of Venn’s, but
escapes his narrowness. There is nothing in it so far which could
not be easily expressed with complete precision in the terms of
ordinary logic. Nor is it necessarily confined to probabilities which
are numerical. In some cases we may know the exact number which
expresses the truth-frequency of our class; but a less precise knowledge
is not without value, and we may say that one probability is greater
than another, without knowing how much greater, and that it is
large or small or negligible, if we have knowledge of corresponding
accuracy about the truth-frequencies of the classes to which the
probabilities refer. The magnitudes of some pairs of probabilities we
shall be able to compare numerically, others in respect of more and
less only, and others not at all. A great deal, therefore, of what has
been said in Chapter III. would apply equally to the present theory,
with this difference that the probabilities would, as a matter of fact,
have numerical values in all cases, and the less complete comparisons
would only hold the field in cases where the real probabilities were
partially unknown. On the frequency theory, therefore, there is an
important sense in which probabilities can be unknown, and the
relative vagueness of the probabilities employed in ordinary reasoning
is explained as belonging not to the probabilities themselves but only
to our knowledge of them. For the probabilities are relative, not to
our knowledge, but to some objective class, possessing a perfectly
definite truth-frequency, to which we have chosen to refer them.
The frequency theory expounded in this manner cannot easily
avoid mention of the relativity of probabilities which is implicit here,
as it is in Venn’s. Whether or not the probability of a proposition
is relative to given data, it is clearly relative to the particular class
or series to which we choose to refer it. A given proposition has
a great variety of different probabilities corresponding to each of
the various distinct classes of which it is a member; and before an
intelligible meaning can be given to a statement that the probability
of a proposition is so-and-so, the class must be specified to which the
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 114
proposition is being referred. Most adherents of the frequency theory
would probably go further, and agree that the class of reference must
be determined in any particular case by the data at our disposal.
Here, then, is another point on which it is not necessary for the
frequency theory to diverge from the theory of this Treatise. It should,
I think, be generally agreed by every school of thought that the
probability of a conclusion is in an important sense relative to given
premisses. On this issue and also on the point that our knowledge of
many probabilities is not numerically definite, there might well be for
the future an end of disagreement, and disputation might be reserved
for the philosophical interpretation of these settled facts, which it is
unreasonable to deny, however we may explain them.
11. I now proceed to those contentions upon which my
fundamental criticism of the frequency theory is founded. The first
of these relates to the method by which the class of reference is
to be determined. The magnitude of a probability is always to be
measured by the truth-frequency of some class; and this class, it is
allowed, must be determined by reference to the premisses, on which
the probability of the conclusion is to be determined. But, as a
given proposition belongs to innumerable different classes, how are
we to know which class the premisses indicate as appropriate? What
substitute has the frequency theory to offer for judgments of relevance
and indifference? And without something of this kind, what principle
is there for uniquely determining the class, the truth-frequency of
which is to measure the probability of the argument? Indeed the
difficulties of showing how given premisses determine the class of
reference, by means of rules expressed in terms of previous ideas, and
without the introduction of any notion, which is new and peculiar to
probability, appear to me insurmountable.
Whilst no general criterion of choice seems to exist, where of two
alternative classes neither includes the other, it might be thought
that where one does include the other, the obvious course would be
to take the narrowest and most specialised class. This procedure was
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 115
examined and rejected by Venn; though the objection to it is due,
not, as he supposed, to the lack of sufficient statistics in such cases
upon which to found a generalisation, but to the inclusion in the
class-concept of marks characteristic of the proposition in question,
but nevertheless not relevant to the matter in hand. If the process of
narrowing the class were to be carried to its furthest point, we should
generally be left with a class whose only member is the proposition in
question, for we generally know something about it which is true of no
other proposition. We cannot, therefore, define the class of reference
as being the class of propositions of which everything is true which
is known to be true of the proposition whose probability we seek to
determine. And, indeed, in those examples for which the frequency
theory possesses the greatest prima facie plausibility, the class of
reference is selected by taking account of some only of the known
characteristics of the quaesitum, those characteristics, namely, which
are relevant in the circumstances. In those cases in which one can
admit that the probability can be measured by reference to a known
truth-frequency, the class of reference is formed of propositions about
which our relevant knowledge is the same as about the proposition
under consideration. In these special cases we get the same result
from the frequency theory as from the Principle of Indifference. But
this does not serve to rehabilitate the frequency theory as a general
explanation of probability, and goes rather to show that the theory of
this Treatise is the generalised theory, comprehending within it such
applications of the idea of statistical truth-frequency as have validity.
‘Relevance’ is an important term in probability, of which the
meaning is readily intelligible. I have given my own definition of it
already. But I do not know how it is to be explained in terms of
the frequency theory. Whether supporters of this theory have fully
appreciated the difficulty I much doubt. It is a fundamental issue
involving the essence of the peculiarity of probability, which prevents
its being explained away in terms of statistical frequency or anything
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 116
else.
12. Yet perhaps a modified view of the frequency theory could be
evolved which would avoid this difficulty, and I proceed, therefore, to
some further criticisms. It might be agreed that a novel element must
be admitted at this point, and that relevancy must be determined in
some such manner as has been explained in earlier chapters. With
this admission, it might be argued, the theory would still stand,
divested, it is true, of some of its original simplicity, but nevertheless
a substantial theory differing in important respects, although not
quite so fundamentally as before, from alternative schemes.
The next important objection, then, is concerned with the manner
in which the principal theorems of probability are to be established
on a theory of frequency. This will involve an anticipation in some
part of later arguments; and the reader may be well advised to return
to the following paragraph after he has finished Part II.
13. Let us begin by a consideration of the ‘Addition Theorem.’
If a/h denotes the probability of a on hypothesis h, this theorem
may be written (a + b)/h = a/h + b/h - ab/h, and may be read ‘On
hypothesis h the probability of “a or b” is equal to the probability
of a + the probability of b - the probability of “both a and b.” ’ This
theorem, interpreted in some way or other, is universally assumed;
and we must, therefore, inquire what proof of it the frequency
theory can afford. A little symbolism will assist the argument: Let
af represent the truth-frequency of any class a, and let aa/h stand
for ‘the probability of a on hypothesis h, a being the class of reference
determined by this hypothesis.’* We then have aa/h = af , and
we require to prove a proposition, for values of ? and d not yet
determined, which will be of the form:
(a + b)d/h = aa/h + bß/h - ab?/h.
Now if d
0
is the class of propositions (a + b) such that a is an a
*The question, previously at issue, as to how the class of reference is
determined by the hypothesis, is now ignored.
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 117
and b a ß, it is easily shown by the ordinary arithmetic of classes
that d
0
f = af + ßf - aßf where aß is the class of propositions which
are members of both a and ß. In the case, therefore, where d = d
0
and ? = aß, an addition theorem of the required kind has been
established.
But it does not follow by any reasonable rule that, if h determines
a and ß as the appropriate classes of reference for a and b, h must
necessarily determine d
0 and aß as the appropriate classes of reference
for (a + b) and ab; it may, for instance, be the case that h, while
it renders a and ß determinate, yields no information whatever
regarding aß, and points to some quite different class µ as the
suitable class of reference for ab. On the frequency theory, therefore,
we cannot maintain that the addition theorem is true in general, but
only in those special cases where it happens that d = d
0 and ? = aß.
The following is a good example: We are given that the proportion
of black-haired men in the population is p1
q
and the proportion of
colour-blind men p2
q
, and there is no known connection between
black-hair and colour-blindness: what is the probability that a man,
about whom nothing special is known, is*
either black-haired or
colour-blind? If we represent the hypotheses by h and the alternatives
by a and b, it would usually be held that, colour-blindness and
black hair being independent for knowledge †
relative to the given
data, ab/h =
p1p2
q
2
, and that, therefore, by the addition theorem,
(a + b)/h =
p1
q
+
p2
q
-
p1p2
q
2
. But, on the frequency theory, this result
might be invalid; for aßf =
p1p2
q
2
, only if this is the actual proportion
in fact of persons who are both colour-blind and black-haired, and
that this is the actual proportion cannot possibly be inferred from
*
In the course of the present discussion the disjunctive a + b is never
interpreted so as to exclude the conjunctive ab.
†For a discussion of this term see Chapter XVI. § 2.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 118
the independence for knowledge of the characters in question.*
Precisely the same difficulty arises in connection with the
multiplication theorem ab/h = a/bh  b/h.
†
In the frequency notation,
which is proposed above, the corresponding theorem will be of the
form abd/h = a?/bh  bß/h. For this equation to be satisfied it is easily
seen that d must be the class of propositions xy such that x is a
member of a and y of ß, and ? the class of propositions xb such that
x is a member of a; and, as in the case of the addition theorem, we
have no guarantee that these classes ? and d will be those which the
hypotheses bh and h will respectively determine as the appropriate
classes of reference for a and ab.
In the case of the theorem of inverse probability‡
b/ah
c/ah =
a/bh
a/ch 
b/h
c/h
the same difficulty again arises, with an additional one when
practical applications are considered. For the relative probabilities
of our à priori hypotheses, b and c, will scarcely ever be capable
of determination by means of known frequencies, and in the
most legitimate instances of the inverse principle’s operation we
depend either upon an inductive argument or upon the Principle of
Indifference. It is hard to think of an example in which the frequency
conditions are even approximately satisfied.
Thus an important class of case, in which arguments in probability,
generally accepted as satisfactory, do not satisfy the frequency
conditions given above, are those in which the notion is introduced of
two propositions being, on certain data, independent for knowledge.
*Venn argues (Logic of Chance, pp. 173, 174) that there is an inductive
ground for making this inference. The question of extending the fundamental
theorems of a frequency theory of probability by means of induction is discussed
in § 14 below.
†Vide Chapter XII. § 6, and Chapter XIV. § 4.
‡Vide Chapter XIV. § 5.
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 119
The meaning and definition of this expression is discussed more fully
in Part II.; but I do not see what interpretation the frequency
theory can put upon it. Yet if the conception of ‘independence for
knowledge’ is discarded, we shall be brought to a standstill in the vast
majority of problems, which are ordinarily considered to be problems
in probability, simply from the lack of sufficiently detailed data. Thus
the frequency theory is not adequate to explain the processes of
reasoning which it sets out to explain. If the theory restricts its
operation, as would seem necessary, to those cases in which we know
precisely how far the true members of a and ß overlap, the vast
majority of arguments in which probability has been employed must
be rejected.
14. An appeal to some further principle is, therefore, required
before the ordinary apparatus of probable inference can be established
on considerations of statistical frequency; and it may have occurred
to some readers that assistance may be obtained from the principles
of induction. Here also it will be necessary to anticipate a subsequent
discussion. If the argument of Part III. is correct, nothing is more
fatal than Induction to the theory now under criticism. For, so
far from Induction’s lending support to the fundamental rules of
probability, it is itself dependent on them. In any case, it is generally
agreed that an inductive conclusion is only probable, and that its
probability increases with the number of instances upon which it
is founded. According to the frequency theory, this belief is only
justified if the majority of inductive conclusions actually are true, and
it will be false, even on our existing data, that any of them are even
probable, if the acknowledged possibility that a majority are false
is an actuality. Yet what possible reason can the frequency theory
offer, which does not beg the question, for supposing that a majority
are true? And failing this, what ground have we for believing the
inductive process to be reasonable? Yet we invariably assume that
with our existing knowledge it is logically reasonable to attach some
weight to the inductive method, even if future experience shows that
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 120
not one of its conclusions is verified in fact. The frequency theory,
therefore, in its present form at any rate, entirely fails to explain or
justify the most important source of the most usual arguments in the
field of probable inference.
15. The failure of the frequency theory to explain or justify
arguments from induction or analogy suggests some remarks of a
more general kind. While it is undoubtedly the case that many
valuable judgments in probability are partly based on a knowledge of
statistical frequencies, and that many more can be held, with some
plausibility, to be indirectly derived from them, there remains a great
mass of probable argument which it would be paradoxical to justify in
the same manner. It is not sufficient, therefore, even if it is possible,
to show that the theory can be developed in a self-consistent manner;
it must also be shown how the body of probable argument, upon
which the greater part of our generally accepted knowledge seems to
rest, can be explained in terms of it; for it is certain that much of it
does not appear to be derived from premisses of statistical frequency.
Take, for instance, the intricate network of arguments upon which
the conclusions of The Origin of Species are founded: how impossible
it would be to transform them into a shape in which they would be
seen to rest upon statistical frequency! Many individual arguments, of
course, are explicitly founded upon such considerations; but this only
serves to differentiate them more clearly from those which are not.
Darwin’s own account of the nature of the argument may be quoted:
“The belief in Natural Selection must at present be grounded entirely
on general considerations: (1) on its being a vera causa, from the
struggle for existence and the certain geological fact that species do
somehow change; (2) from the analogy of change under domestication
by man’s selection; (3) and chiefly from this view connecting under
an intelligible point of view a host of facts. When we descend to
details . . . we cannot prove that a single species has changed; nor
can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial, which is the
groundwork of the theory; nor can we explain why some species have
ch. viii FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS 121
changed and others have not.” * Not only in the main argument, but
in many of the subsidiary discussions,† an elaborate combination of
induction and analogy is superimposed upon a narrow and limited
knowledge of statistical frequency. And this is equally the case in
almost all everyday arguments of any degree of complexity. The class
of judgments, which a theory of statistical frequency can comprehend,
is too narrow to justify its claim to present a complete theory of
probability.
16. Before concluding this chapter, we should not overlook
the element of truth which the frequency theory embodies and which
provides its plausibility. In the first place, it gives a true account, so
long as it does not argue that probability and frequency are identical,
of a large number of the most precise arguments in probability, and of
those to which mathematical treatment is easily applicable. It is this
characteristic which has recommended it to statisticians, and explains
the large measure of its acceptance in England at the present time;
for the popularity in this country of an opinion, which has, so far as I
know, no thorough supporters abroad, may reasonably be attributed
to the chance which has led most of the English writers, who have
paid much attention to probability in recent years, to approach the
subject from the statistical side.
In the second place, the statement that the probability of an
event is measured by its actual frequency of occurrence ‘in the long
run’ has a very close connection with a valid conclusion which can
be derived, in certain cases, from Bernoulli’s theorem. This theorem
and its connection with the theory of frequency will be the subject of
Chapter XXIX.
17. The absence of a recent exposition of the logical basis
of the frequency theory by any of its adherents has been a great
disadvantage to me in criticising it. It is possible that some of the
*Letter to G. Bentham, Life and Letters, vol. iii. p. 25.
†E.g. in the discussion on the relative effect of disuse and selection in
reducing unnecessary organs to a rudimentary condition.
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 122
opinions, which I have examined at length, are now held by no one;
nor am I absolutely certain, at the present stage of the inquiry, that
a partial rehabilitation of the theory may not be possible. But I am
sure that the objections which I have raised cannot be met without
a great complication of the theory, and without robbing it of the
simplicity which is its greatest preliminary recommendation. Until
the theory has been given new foundations, its logical basis is not
so secure as to permit controversial applications of it in practice. A
good deal of modern statistical work may be based, I think, upon an
inconsistent logical scheme, which, avowedly founded upon a theory
of frequency, introduces principles which this theory has no power to
justify.
CHAPTER IX
the constructive theory of part i. summarized
1. That part of our knowledge which we obtain directly, supplies
the premisses of that part which we obtain by argument. From these
premisses we seek to justify some degree of rational belief about all
sorts of conclusions. We do this by perceiving certain logical relations
between the premisses and the conclusions. The kind of rational
belief which we infer in this manner is termed probable (or in the
limit certain), and the logical relations, by the perception of which it
is obtained, we term relations of probability.
The probability of a conclusion a derived from premisses h we
write a/h; and this symbol is of fundamental importance.
2. The object of the Theory or Logic of Probability is to
systematise such processes of inference. In particular it aims at
elucidating rules by means of which the probabilities of different
arguments can be compared. It is of great practical importance
to determine which of two conclusions is on the evidence the more
probable.
The most important of these rules is the Principle of Indifference.
According to this Principle we must rely upon direct judgment
for discriminating between the relevant and the irrelevant parts of
the evidence. We can only discard those parts of the evidence
which are irrelevant by seeing that they have no logical bearing on
the conclusion. The irrelevant evidence being thus discarded, the
Principle lays it down that if the evidence for either conclusion is the
same (i.e. symmetrical), then their probabilities also are the same
(i.e. equal).
If, on the other hand, there is additional evidence (i.e. in addition
to the symmetrical evidence) for one of the conclusions, and this
evidence is favourably relevant, then that conclusion is the more
probable. Certain rules have been given by which to judge whether
123
pt. i A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 124
or not evidence is favourably relevant. And by combinations of these
judgments of preference with the judgments of indifference warranted
by the Principle of Indifference more complicated comparisons are
possible.
3. There are, however, many cases in which these rules furnish no
means of comparison; and in which it is certain that it is not actually
within our power to make the comparison. It has been argued that
in these cases the probabilities are, in fact, not comparable. As in the
example of similarity, where there are different orders of increasing
and diminishing similarity, but where it is not possible to say of every
pair of objects which of them is on the whole the more like a third
object, so there are different orders of probability, and probabilities,
which are not of the same order, cannot be compared.
4. It is sometimes of practical importance, when, for example,
we wish to evaluate a chance or to determine the amount of our
expectation, to say not only that one probability is greater than
another, but by how much it is greater. We wish, that is to say, to
have a numerical measure of degrees of probability.
This is only occasionally possible. A rule can be given for
numerical measurement when the conclusion is one of a number
of equiprobable, exclusive, and exhaustive alternatives, but not
otherwise.
5. In Part II. I proceed to a symbolic treatment of the subject,
and to the greater systematisation, by symbolic methods on the basis
of certain axioms, of the rules of probable argument.
In Parts III., IV., and V. the nature of certain very important
types of probable argument of a complex kind will be treated in
detail; in Part III. the methods of Induction and Analogy, in Part
IV. certain semi-philosophical problems, and in Part V. the logical
foundations of the methods of inference now commonly known as
statistical.
PART II
fundamental theorems
CHAPTER X
introductory
1. In Part I. we have been occupied with the epistemology of our
subject, that is to say, with what we know about the characteristics
and the justification of probable Knowledge. In Part II. I pass to its
Formal Logic. I am not certain of how much positive value this Part
will prove to the reader. My object in it is to show that, starting from
the philosophical ideas of Part I., we can deduce by rigorous methods
out of simple and precise definitions the usually accepted results, such
as the theorems of the addition and multiplication of probabilities
and of inverse probability. The reader will readily perceive that
this Part would never have been written except under the influence
of Mr. Russell’s Principia Mathematica. But I am sensible that it
may suffer from the over-elaboration and artificiality of this method
without the justification which its grandeur of scale affords to that
great work. In common, however, with other examples of formal
method, this attempt has had the negative advantage of compelling
the author to make his ideas precise and of discovering fallacies
and mistakes. It is a part of the spade-work which a conscientious
author has to undertake; though the process of doing it may be of
greater value to him than the results can be to the reader, who is
concerned to know, as a safeguard of the reliability of the rest of the
construction, that the thing can be done, rather than to examine the
architectural plans in detail. In the development of my own thought,
the following chapters have been of great importance. For it was
through trying to prove the fundamental theorems of the subject on
the hypothesis that Probability was a relation that I first worked my
way into the subject; and the rest of this Treatise has arisen out of
attempts to solve the successive questions to which the ambition to
treat Probability as a branch of Formal Logic first gave rise.
A further occasion of diffidence and apology in introducing this
126
ch. x FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 127
Part of my Treatise arises out of the extent of my debt to Mr. W. E.
Johnson. I worked out the first scheme in complete independence
of his work and ignorant of the fact that he had thought, more
profoundly than I had, along the same lines; I have also given the
exposition its final shape with my own hands. But there was an
intermediate stage, at which I submitted what I had done for his
criticism, and received the benefit not only of criticism but of his own
constructive exercises. The result is that in its final form it is difficult
to indicate the exact extent of my indebtedness to him. When the
following pages were first in proof, there seemed little likelihood of the
appearance of any work on Probability from his own pen, and I do
not now proceed to publication with so good a conscience, when he
is announcing the approaching completion of a work on Logic which
will include “Problematic Inference.”
I propose to give here a brief summary of the five chapters
following, without attempting to be rigorous or precise. I shall then
be free to write technically in Chapters XI.–XV., inviting the reader,
who is not specially interested in the details of this sort of technique,
to pass them by.
2. Probability is concerned with arguments, that is to say,
with the “bearing” of one set of propositions upon another set. If
we are to deal formally with a generalised treatment of this subject,
we must be prepared to consider relations of probability between
any pair of sets of propositions, and not only between sets which
are actually the subject of knowledge. But we soon find that some
limitation must be put on the character of sets of propositions which
we can consider as the hypothetical subject of an argument, namely,
that they must be possible subjects of knowledge. We cannot, that
is to say, conveniently apply our theorems to premisses which are
self-contradictory and formally inconsistent with themselves.
For the purpose of this limitation we have to make a distinction
between a set of propositions which is merely false in fact and a
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 128
set which is formally inconsistent with itself.* This leads us to the
conception of a group of propositions, which is defined as a set of
propositions such that—(i.) if a logical principle belongs to it, all
propositions which are instances of that logical principle also belong
to it; (ii.) if the proposition p and the proposition ‘not-p or q’ both
belong to it, then the proposition q also belongs to it; (iii.) if any
proposition p belongs to it, then the contradictory of p is excluded
from it. If the group defined by one part of a set of propositions
excludes a proposition which belongs to a group defined by another
part of the set, then the set taken as a whole is inconsistent with
itself and is incapable of forming the premiss of an argument.
The conception of a group leads on to a precise definition of
one proposition requiring another (which in the realm of assertion
corresponds to relevance in the realm of probability), and of logical
priority as being an order of propositions arising out of their relation
to those special groups, or real groups, which are in fact the subject
of knowledge. Logical priority has no absolute signification, but is
*Spinoza had in mind, I think, the distinction between Truth and Probability
in his treatment of Necessity, Contingence, and Possibility. Res enim omnes
ex data Dei natura necessario sequutae sunt, et ex necessitate naturae Dei
determinatae sunt ad certo modo existendum et operandum (Ethices i. 33). That
is to say, everything is, without qualification, true or false. At res aliqua
nulla alia de causa contingens dicitur, nisi respectu defectus nostrae cognitionis
(Ethices i. 33, scholium). That is to say, Contingence, or, as I term it,
Probability, solely arises out of the limitations of our knowledge. Contingence
in this wide sense, which includes every proposition which, in relation to our
knowledge, is only probable (this term covering all intermediate degrees of
probability), may be further divided into Contingence in the strict sense, which
corresponds to an à priori or formal probability exceeding zero, and Possibility;
that is to say, into formal possibility and empirical possibility. Res singulares
voco contingentes, quatenus, dum ad earum solam essentiam attendimus, nihil
invenimus, quod earum existentiam necessario ponat, vel quod ipsam necessario
secludat. Easdem res singulares voco possibiles, quatenus dum ad causas, ex
quibus produci debent, attendimus, nescimus, an ipsae determinatae sint ad
easdem producendum (Ethices iv. Def 3, 4).
ch. x FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 129
relative to a specific body of knowledge, or, as it has been termed in
the traditional logic, to the Universe of Reference.
It also enables us to reach a definition of inference distinct from
implication, as defined by Mr. Russell. This is a matter of very great
importance. Readers who are acquainted with the work of Mr. Russell
and his followers will probably have noticed that the contrast between
his work and that of the traditional logic is by no means wholly
due to the greater precision and more mathematical character of his
technique. There is a difference also in the design. His object is
to discover what assumptions are required in order that the formal
propositions generally accepted by mathematicians and logicians may
be obtainable as the result of successive steps or substitutions of a few
very simple types, and to lay bare by this means any inconsistencies
which may exist in received results. But beyond the fact that the
conclusions to which he seeks to lead up are those of common sense,
and that the uniform type of argument, upon the validity of which
each step of his system depends, is of a specially obvious kind, he is
not concerned with analysing the methods of valid reasoning which
we actually employ. He concludes with familiar results, but he reaches
them from premisses, which have never occurred to us before, and by
an argument so elaborate that our minds have difficulty in following
it. As a method of setting forth the system of formal truth, which
shall possess beauty, interdependence, and completeness, his is vastly
superior to any which has preceded it. But it gives rise to questions
about the relation in which ordinary reasoning stands to this ordered
system, and, in particular, as to the precise connection between the
process of inference, in which the older logicians were principally
interested but which he ignores, and the relation of implication on
which his scheme depends.
‘p implies q’ is, according to his definition, exactly equivalent to
the disjunction ‘q is true or p is false.’ If q is true, ‘p implies q’
holds for all values of p; and similarly if p is false, the implication
holds for all values of q. This is not what we mean when we say
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 130
that q can be inferred or follows from p. For whatever the exact
meaning of inference may be, it certainly does not hold between all
pairs of true propositions, and is not of such a character that every
proposition follows from a false one. It is not true that ‘A male
now rules over England’ follows or can be inferred from ‘A male now
rules over France’; or ‘A female now rules over England’ from ‘A
female now rules over France’; whereas, on Mr. Russell’s definition,
the corresponding implications hold simply in virtue of the facts that
‘A male now rules over England’ is true and ‘A female now rules over
France’ is false.
The distinction between the Relatival Logic of Inference and
Probability, and Mr. Russell’s Universal Logic of Implication, seems
to be that the former is concerned with the relations of propositions
in general to a particular limited group. Inference and Probability
depend for their importance upon the fact that in actual reasoning
the limitation of our knowledge presents us with a particular set of
propositions, to which we must relate any other proposition about
which we seek knowledge. The course of an argument and the results
of reasoning depend, not simply on what is true, but on the particular
body of knowledge from which we have set out. Ultimately, indeed,
Mr. Russell cannot avoid concerning himself with groups. For his
aim is to discover the smallest set of propositions which specify our
formal knowledge, and then to show that they do in fact specify it.
In this enterprise, being human, he must confine himself to that part
of formal truth which we know, and the question, how far his axioms
comprehend all formal truth, must remain insoluble. But his object,
nevertheless, is to establish a train of implications between formal
truths; and the character and the justification of rational argument
as such is not his subject.
3. Passing on from these preliminary reflections, our first
task is to establish the axioms and definitions which are to make
operative our symbolical processes. These processes are almost
entirely a development of the idea of representing a probability by
ch. x FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 131
the symbol a/h, where h is the premiss of an argument and a its
conclusion. It might have been a notation more in accordance with
our fundamental ideas, to have employed the symbol a/h to designate
the argument from h to a, and to have represented the probability of
the argument, or rather the degree of rational belief about a which the
argument authorises, by the symbol P(a/h). This would correspond
to the symbol V(a/h) which has been employed in Chapter VI. for the
evidential value of the argument as distinct from its probability. But
in a section where we are only concerned with probabilities, the use of
P(a/h) would have been unnecessarily cumbrous, and it is, therefore,
convenient to drop the prefix P and to denote the probability itself
by a/h.
The discovery of a convenient symbol, like that of an essential
word, has often proved of more than verbal importance. Clear
thinking on the subject of Probability is not possible without a
symbol which takes an explicit account of the premiss of the argument
as well as of its conclusion; and endless confusion has arisen through
discussions about the probability of a conclusion without reference to
the argument as a whole. I claim, therefore, the introduction of the
symbol a/h as an essential step towards any progress in the subject.
4. Inasmuch as relations of Probability cannot be assumed
to possess the properties of numbers, the terms addition and
multiplication of probabilities have to be given appropriate meanings
by definition. It is convenient to employ these familiar expressions,
rather than to invent new ones, because the properties which arise
out of our definitions of addition and multiplication in Probability are
analogous to those of addition and multiplication in Arithmetic. But
the process of establishing these properties is a little complicated and
occupies the greater part of Chapter XII.
The most important of the definitions of Chapter XII. are the
following (the numbers referring to the numbers of Chapter XII.):
II. The Definition of Certainty: a/h = 1.
III. The Definition of Impossibility: a/h = 0.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 132
VI. The Definition of Inconsistency: ah is inconsistent if a/h = 0.
VII. The Definition of a Group: the class of propositions a such
that a/h = 1 is the group h.
VIII. The Definition of Equivalence: if b/ah = 1 and a/bh = 1
(a = b)/h = 1.
IX. The Definition of Addition: ab/h + a
¯b/h* = a/h.
X. The Definition of Multiplication: ab/h = a/bh b/h = b/aha/h.
The symbolical development of the subject largely proceeds out of
these definitions of Addition and Multiplication. It is to be observed
that they give a meaning, not to the addition and multiplication of
any pairs of probabilities, but only to pairs which satisfy a certain
form. The definition of Multiplication may be read: ‘the probability
of both a and b given h is equal to the probability of a given bh,
multiplied by the probability of b given h.’
XI. The Definition of Independence: if a1/a2h = a1/h and
a2/a1h = a2/h, a1/h and a2/h are independent.
XII. The Definition of Irrelevance: if a1/a2h = a1/h, a2 is
irrelevant to a1/h.
5. In Chapter XIII. these definitions, supplemented by a few
axioms, are employed to demonstrate the fundamental theorems of
Certain or Necessary Inference. The interest of this chiefly lies in the
fact that these theorems include those which the traditional Logic has
termed the Laws of Thought, as for example the Law of Contradiction
and the Law of Excluded Middle. These are here exhibited as a part
of the generalised theory of Inference or Rational Argument, which
includes probable Inference as well as certain Inference. The object of
this chapter is to show that the ordinarily accepted rules of Inference
can in fact be deduced from the definitions and axioms of Chapter
XII.
6. In Chapter XIV. I proceed to the fundamental Theorems of
Probable Inference, of which the following are the most interesting:
*¯b stands for the contradictory of b.
ch. x FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 133
Addition Theorem: (a + b)/h = a/h + b/h - ab/h, which reduces
to (a + b)/h = a/h + b/h, where a and b are mutually exclusive; and,
if p1p2 . . . pn form, relative to h a set of exclusive and exhaustive
alternatives, a/h =
Pn
1
pra/h.
Theorem of Irrelevance: If a/h1h2 = a/h1 then a/h1h¯
2 = a/h1; i.e.
if a proposition is irrelevant, its contradictory also is irrelevant.
Theorem of Independence: If a2/a1h = a2/h, a1/a2h = a1/h; i.e. if
a1 is irrelevant to a2/h, it follows that a2 is irrelevant to a1/h and
that a1/h and a2/h are independent.
Multiplication Theorem: If a1/h and a2/h are independent,
a1a2/h = a1/h  a2/h.
Theorem of Inverse Probability:
a1/bh
a2/bh =
b/a1h
b/a2h

a1/h
a2/h. Further, if
a1/h = p1, a2/h = p2, b/a1h = q1, b/a2h = q2, and a1/bh + a2/bh = 1,
then a1/bh =
p1q1
p1q1 + p2q2
; and if a1/h = a2/h, a1/bh =
q1
q1 + q2
, which
is equivalent to the statement that the probability of a1 when we
know b is equal to q1
q1 + q2
, where q1 is the probability of b when
we know a1 and q2 its probability when we know a2. This theorem
enunciated with varying degrees of inaccuracy appears in all Treatises
on Probability, but is not generally proved.
Chapter XIV. concludes with some elaborate theorems on the
combination of premisses based on a technical symbolic device, known
as the Cumulative Formula, which is the work of Mr. W. E. Johnson.
7. In Chapter XV. I bring the non-numerical theory of probability
developed in the preceding chapters into connection with the usual
numerical conception of it, and demonstrate how and in what class of
cases a meaning can be given to a numerical measure of a relation
of probability. This leads on to what may be termed numerical
approximation, that is to say, the relating of probabilities, which are
not themselves numerical, to probabilities, which are numerical, by
means of greater and less, by which in some cases numerical limits
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 134
may be ascribed to probabilities which are not capable of numerical
measures.
CHAPTER XI
the theory of groups, with special reference to
logical consistence, inference, and logical
priority
1. The Theory of Probability deals with the relation between
two sets of propositions, such that, if the first set is known to be true,
the second can be known with the appropriate degree of probability
by argument from the first.* The relation, however, also exists when
the first set is not known to be true and is hypothetical.
In a symbolical treatment of the subject it is important that we
should be free to consider hypothetical premisses, and to take account
of relations of probability as existing between any pair of sets of
propositions, whether or not the premiss is actually part of knowledge.
But in acting thus we must be careful to avoid two possible sources
of error.
2. The first is that which is liable to arise wherever variables
are concerned. This was mentioned in passing in § 18 of Chapter IV.
We must remember that whenever we substitute for a variable some
particular value of it, this may so affect the relevant evidence as to
modify the probability. This danger is always present except where,
as in the first half of Chapter XIII., the conclusions respecting the
variable are certain.
3. The second difficulty is of a different character. Our premisses
may be hypothetical and not actually the subject of knowledge. But
must they not be possible subjects of knowledge? How are we to deal
with hypothetical premisses which are self-contradictory or formally
inconsistent with themselves, and which cannot be the subject of
rational belief of any degree?
*Or more strictly, “perception of which, together with knowledge of the first
set, justifies an appropriate degree of rational belief about the second.”
135
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 136
Whether or not a relation of probability can be held to exist
between a conclusion and a self-inconsistent premiss, it will be
convenient to exclude such relations from our scheme, so as to avoid
having to provide for anomalies which can have no interest in an
account of the actual processes of valid reasoning. Where a premiss
is inconsistent with itself it cannot be required.
4. Let us term the collection of propositions, which are logically
involved in the premisses in the sense that they follow from them,
or, in other words, stand to them in the relation of certainty,*
the
group specified by the premisses. That is to say, we define a group
as containing all the propositions logically involved in any of the
premisses or in any conjunction of them; and as excluding all the
propositions the contradictories of which are logically involved in any
of the premisses or in any conjunction of them.† To say, therefore,
that a proposition follows from a premiss, is the same thing as to say
that it belongs to the group which the premiss specifies.
The idea of a ‘group’ will then enable us to define ‘logical
consistency.’ If any part of the premisses specifies a group containing
a proposition, the contradictory of which is contained in a group
specified by some other part, the premisses are logically inconsistent;
otherwise they are logically consistent. In short, premisses are
inconsistent if a proposition ‘follows from’ one part of them, and its
contradictory from another part.
5. We have still, however, to make precise what we mean in this
definition by one proposition following from or being logically involved
*
‘a can be inferred from b,’ ‘a follows from b,’ ‘a is certain in relation
to b,’ ‘a is logically involved in b,’ I regard as equivalent expressions, the precise
meaning of which will be defined in succeeding paragraphs. ‘a is implied by b,’
I use in a different sense, namely, in Mr. Russell’s sense, as the equivalent of
‘b or not-a.’
†For the conception of a group, and for many other notions and definitions
in the course of this chapter—those, for example, of a real group and of logical
priority—I am largely indebted to Mr. W. E. Johnson. The origination of the
theory of groups is due to him.
ch. xi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 137
in the truth of another. We seem to intend by these expressions
some kind of transition by means of a logical principle. A logical
principle cannot be better defined, I think, than in terms of what
in Mr. Russell’s Logic of Implication is termed a formal implication.
‘p implies q’ is a formal implication if ‘not-p or q’ is formally true;
and a proposition is formally true, if it is a value of a propositional
function, in which all the constituents other than the arguments are
logical constants, and of which all the values are true.
We might define a group in such a way that all logical principles
belonged to every group. In this case all formally true propositions
would belong to every group. This definition is logically precise and
would lead to a coherent theory. But it possesses the defect of not
closely corresponding to the methods of reasoning we actually employ,
because all logical principles are not in fact known to us. And even in
the case of those which we do know, there seems to be a logical order
(to which on the above definition we cannot give a sense) amongst
propositions, which are about logical constants and are formally true,
just as there is amongst propositions which are not formally true.
Thus, if we were to assume the premisses in every argument to include
all formally true propositions, the sphere of probable argument would
be limited to what (in contradistinction to formally true propositions)
we may term empirical propositions.
6. For this reason, therefore, I prefer a narrower definition—which
shall correspond more exactly to what we seem to mean when we say
that one proposition follows from another. Let us define a group of
propositions as a set of propositions such that:
(i.) if the proposition ‘p is formally true’ belongs to the group,
all propositions which are instances of the same formal propositional
function also belong to it;
(ii.) if the proposition p and the proposition ‘p implies q’ both
belong to it, then the proposition q also belongs to it;
(iii.) if any proposition p belongs to it, then the contradictory of p
is excluded from it.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 138
According to this definition all processes of certain inference are
wholly composed of steps each of which is of one of two simple types
(and if we like we might perhaps regard the first as comprehending
the other). I do not feel certain that these conditions may not
be narrower than what we mean when we say that one proposition
follows from another. But it is not necessary for the purpose of
defining a group, to dogmatise as to whether any other additional
methods of inference are, or are not, open to us. If we define a group
as the propositions logically involved in the premisses in the above
sense, and prescribe that the premisses of an argument in probability
must specify a group not less extensive than this, we are placing
the minimum amount of restriction upon the form of our premisses.
If, sometimes or as a rule, our premisses in fact include some more
powerful principle of argument, so much the better.
In the formal rules of probability which follow, it will be postulated
that the set of propositions, which form the premiss of any argument,
must not be inconsistent. The premiss must, that is to say, specify
a ‘group’ in the sense that no part of the premiss must exclude a
proposition which follows from another part. But for this purpose we
do not need to dogmatise as to what the criterion is of inference or
certainty.
7. It will be convenient at this point to define a term which
expresses the relation converse to that which exists between a set
of propositions and the group which they specify. The propositions
p1, p2 . . . pn are said to be fundamental to the group h if (i.) they
themselves belong to the group (which involves their being consistent
with one another); (ii.) if between them they completely specify the
group; and (iii.) if none of them belong to the group specified by the
rest (for if pr belongs to the group specified by the rest, this term is
redundant).
When the fundamental set is uniquely determined, a group h
0
is a
subgroup to the group h, if the set fundamental to h
0
is included in
the set fundamental to h.
ch. xi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 139
Logically there can be more than one distinct set of propositions
fundamental to a given group; and some extra-logical test must be
applied before the fundamental set is determined uniquely. On the
other hand, a group is completely determined when the constituent
propositions of the fundamental set are given. Further, any consistent
set of propositions evidently specifies some group, although such a set
may contain propositions additional to those which are fundamental
to the group it specifies. It is clear also that only one group can
be specified by a given set of consistent propositions. The members
of a group are, we may say, rationally bound up with the set of
propositions fundamental to it.
8. If Mr. Bertrand Russell is right, the whole of pure mathematics
and of formal logic follows, in the sense defined above, from a small
number of primitive propositions. The group, therefore, which is
specified by these primitive propositions, includes the most remote
deductions not only amongst those known to mathematicians, but
amongst those which time and skill have not yet served to solve. If
we define certainty in a logical and not a psychological sense, it seems
necessary, if our premisses include the essential axioms, to regard as
certain all propositions which follow from these, whether or not they
are known to us. Yet it seems as if there must be some logical
sense in which unproved mathematical theorems—some of those, for
instance, which deal with the theory of numbers—can be likely or
unlikely, and in which a proposition of this kind, which has been
suggested to us by analogy or supported by induction, can possess an
intermediate degree of probability.
There can be no doubt, I think, that the logical relation of
certainty does exist in these cases in which lack of skill or insight
prevents our apprehending it, in spite of the fact that sufficient
premisses, including sufficient logical principles, are known to us. In
these cases we must say, what we are not permitted to say when the
indeterminacy arises from lack of premisses, that the probability is
unknown. There is still a sense, however, in which in such a case the
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 140
knowledge we actually possess can be, in a logical sense, only probable.
While the relation of certainty exists between the fundamental axioms
and every mathematical hypothesis (or its contradictory), there are
other data in relation to which these hypotheses possess intermediate
degrees of probability. If we are unable through lack of skill to discover
the relation of probability which an hypothesis does in fact bear
towards one set of data, this set is practically useless, and we must fix
our attention on some other set in relation to which the probability
is not unknown. When Newton held that the binomial theorem
possessed for empirical reasons sufficient probability to warrant a
further investigation of it, it was not in relation to the axioms of
mathematics, whether he knew them or not, that the probability
existed, but in relation to his empirical evidence combined, perhaps,
with some of the axioms. There is, in short, an exception to the rule
that we must always consider the probability of any conclusion in
relation to the whole of the data in our possession. When the relation
of the conclusion to the whole of our evidence cannot be known,
then we must be guided by its relation to some part of the evidence.
When, therefore, in later chapters I speak of a formal proposition as
possessing an intermediate degree of probability, this will always be
in relation to evidence from which the proposition does not logically
follow in the sense defined in § 6.
9. It follows from the preceding definitions that a proposition is
certain in relation to a given premiss, or, in other words, follows from
this premiss if it is included in the group which that premiss specifies.
It is impossible if it is excluded from the group—if, that is to say,
its contradictory follows from the premiss. We often say, somewhat
loosely, that two propositions are contradictory to one another, when
they are inconsistent in the sense that, relative to our evidence, they
cannot belong to the same group. On the other hand, a proposition,
which is not itself included in the group specified by the premiss
and whose contradictory is not included either, has in relation to the
premiss an intermediate degree of probability.
ch. xi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 141
If a follows from h and is, therefore, included in the group specified
by h, this is denoted by a/h = 1. The relation of certainty, that is to
say, is denoted by the symbol of unity. The reason why this notation
is useful and has been adopted by common consent will appear when
the meaning of the product of a pair of relations of probability has
been explained. If we represent the relation of certainty by ? and
any other probability by a, the product a  ? = a. Similarly, if
a is excluded from the group specified by h and is impossible in
relation to it, this is denoted by a/h = 0. The use of the symbol
zero to denote impossibility arises out of the fact that, if ? denotes
impossibility and a any other relation of probability, then, in the
senses of multiplication and addition to be defined later, the product
a  ? = ?, and the sum a + ? = a. Lastly, if a is not included in the
group specified by h, this is written a/h =| 1 or a/h < 1; and if it is
not excluded, this is written a/h =| 0 or a/h > 0.
10. The theory of groups now enables us to give an account,
with the aid of some further conceptions, of logical priority and of the
true nature of inference. The groups, to which we refer the arguments
by which we actually reason, are not arbitrarily chosen. They are
determined by those propositions of which we have direct knowledge.
Our group of reference is specified by those direct judgments in
which we personally rationally certify the truth of some propositions
and the falsity of others. So long as it is undetermined, or not
determined uniquely, which propositions are fundamental, it is not
possible to discover a necessary order amongst propositions or to show
in what way a true proposition ‘follows from’ one true premiss rather
than another. But when we have determined what propositions are
fundamental, by selecting those which we know directly to be true,
or in some other way, then a meaning can be attached to priority
and to the distinction between inference and implication. When the
propositions which we know directly are given, there is a logical order
amongst those other propositions which we know indirectly and by
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 142
argument.
11. It will be useful to distinguish between those groups which
are hypothetical and those of which the fundamental set is known to
be true. We will term the former hypothetical groups and the latter
real groups. To the real group, which contains all the propositions
which are known to be true, we may assign the old logical term
Universe of Reference. While knowledge is here taken as the criterion
of a real group, what follows will be equally valid whatever criterion
is taken, so long as the fundamental set is in some manner or other
determined uniquely.
If it is impossible for us to know a proposition p except by
inference from a knowledge of q, so that we cannot know p to be
true unless we already know q, this may be expressed by saying that
‘p requires q’. More precisely requirement is defined as follows:
p does not require q if there is some real group to which p belongs
and q does not belong, i.e. if there is a real group h such that
p/h = 1, q/h =| 1; hence
p requires q if there is no real group to which p belongs and q does
not belong.
p does not require q within the group h, if the group h, to which
p belongs, contains a subgroup* h
0
to which p belongs and q does
not belong; i.e. if there is a group h
0
such that h
0/h = 1, p/h0 = 1,
q/h0 =| 1. This reduces to the proposition next but one above if h is
the Universe of Reference. In § 13 these definitions will be generalised
to cover intermediate degrees of probability.
12. Inference and logical priority can be defined in terms of
requirement and real groups. It is convenient to distinguish two types
of inference corresponding to hypothetical and real groups—i.e. to
cases where the argument is only hypothetical, and cases where the
conclusion can be asserted:
Hypothetical Inference.—‘If p, q,’ which may also be read ‘q is
*Subgroups have only been defined, it must be noticed (see § 7 above) when
the fundamental set of the group has been, in some way, uniquely determined.
ch. xi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 143
hypothetically inferrible from p,’ means that there is a real group h
such that q/ph = 1, and q/h =| 1. In order that this may be the
case, ph must specify a group; i.e. p/h =| 0, or in other words p must
not be excluded from h. Hypothetical inference is also equivalent to:
‘p implies q’ and ‘p implies q’ does not require ‘q’. In other words,
q is hypothetically inferrible from p, if we know that q is true or p is
false and if we can know this without first knowing either that q is
true or that p is false.
Assertoric Inference.—‘p ? q,’ which may be read ‘p therefore q’
or ‘q may be asserted by inference from p,’ means that ‘if p, q’ is
true, and in addition ‘p’ belongs to a real group; i.e. there are proper
groups h and h
0
such that p/h = 1, q/ph0 = 1, q/h0 =| 1, and p/h0 =| 0.
p is prior to q when p does not require q, and q requires p, when,
that is to say, we can know p without knowing q, but not q unless we
first know p.
p is prior to q within the group h when p does not require q within
the group, and q does require p within the group.
It follows from this and from the preceding definitions that, if
a proposition is fundamental in the sense that we can only know
it directly, there is no proposition prior to it; and, more generally,
that, if a proposition is fundamental to a given group, there is no
proposition prior to it within the group.
13. We can now apply the conception of requirement to
intermediate degrees of probability. The notation adopted is, it will
be remembered, as follows:
p/h = a means that the proposition p has the probable relation
of degree a to the proposition h; while it is postulated that h is
self-consistent and therefore specifies a group.
p/h = 1 means that p follows from h and is, therefore, included in
the group specified by h.
p/h = 0 means that p is excluded from the group specified by h.
If h specifies the Universe of Reference, i.e. if its group
comprehends the whole of our knowledge, p/h is called the absolute
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 144
probability of p, or (for short) the probability of p; and if p/h = 1 and
h specifies any real group, p is said to be absolutely certain or (for
short) certain. Thus p is ‘certain’ if it is a member of a real group,
and a ‘certain’ proposition is one which we know to be true. Similarly
if p/h = 0 under the same conditions, p is absolutely impossible, or
(for short) impossible. Thus an ‘impossible’ proposition is one which
we know to be false.
The definition of requirement, when it is generalised so as to take
account of intermediate degrees of probability, becomes, it will be
seen, equivalent to that of relevance:
The probability of p does not require q within the group h, if there
is a subgroup h
0
such that, for every subgroup h
00 which includes h
0
and is included in h (i.e. h
0/h00 = 1, h
00/h = 1), p/h00 = p/h0
, and
q/h0 =| q/h.
When p is included in the group h, this definition reduces to the
definition of requirement given in § 11.
14. The importance of the theory of groups arises as soon as
we admit that there are some propositions which we take for granted
without argument, and that all arguments, whether demonstrative
or probable, consist in the relating of other conclusions to these as
premisses.
The particular propositions, which are in fact fundamental to the
Universe of Reference, vary from time to time and from person to
person. Our theory must also be applicable to hypothetical Universes.
Although a particular Universe of Reference may be defined by
considerations which are partly psychological, when once the Universe
is given, our theory of the relation in which other propositions stand
towards it is entirely logical.
The formal development of the theory of argument from imposed
and limited premisses, which is attempted in the following chapters,
resembles in its general method other parts of formal logic. We
seek to establish implications between our primitive axioms and the
derivative propositions, without specific reference to what particular
ch. xi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 145
propositions are fundamental in our actual Universe of Reference.
It will be seen more clearly in the following chapters that the
laws of inference are the laws of probability, and that the former is
a particular case of the latter. The relation of a proposition to a
group depends upon the relevance to it of the group, and a group is
relevant in so far as it contains a necessary or sufficient condition of
the proposition, or a necessary or sufficient condition of a necessary
or sufficient condition, and so on; a condition being necessary if every
hypothetical group, which includes the proposition together with the
Universe of Reference, includes the condition, and sufficient if every
hypothetical group, which includes the condition together with the
Universe of Reference, includes the proposition.
CHAPTER XII
the definitions and axioms of inference and
probability
1. It is not necessary for the validity of what follows to
decide in what manner the set of propositions is determined, which
is fundamental to our Universe of Reference, or to make definite
assumptions as to what propositions are included in the group which
is specified by the data. When we are investigating an empirical
problem, it will be natural to include the whole of our logical
apparatus, the whole body, that is to say, of formal truths which
are known to us, together with that part of our empirical knowledge
which is relevant. But in the following formal developments, which
are designed to display the logical rules of probability, we need only
assume that our data always include those logical rules, of which the
steps of our proofs are instances, together with the axioms relating to
probability which we shall enunciate.
The object of this and the chapters immediately following is to
show that all the usually assumed conclusions in the fundamental
logic of inference and probability follow rigorously from a few axioms,
in accordance with the fundamental conceptions expounded in Part
I. This body of axioms and theorems corresponds, I think, to what
logicians have termed the Laws of Thought, when they have meant by
this something narrower than the whole system of formal truth. But
it goes beyond what has been usual, in dealing at the same time with
the laws of probable, as well as of necessary, inference.
2. This and the following chapters of Part II. are largely
independent of many of the more controversial issues raised in the
preceding chapters. They do not prejudge the question as to whether
or not all probabilities are theoretically measurable; and they are
not dependent on our theories as to the part played by direct
judgment in establishing relations of probability or inference between
146
ch. xii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 147
particular propositions. Their premisses are all hypothetical. Given
the existence of certain relations of probability, others are inferred.
Of the conclusions of Chapter III., of the criteria of equiprobability
and of inequality discussed in Chapters IV. and V., and of the criteria
of inference discussed in §§ 5, 6 of Chapter XI., they are, I think,
wholly independent. They deal with a different part of the subject,
not so closely connected with epistemology.
3. In this chapter I confine myself to Definitions and Axioms.
Propositions will be denoted by small letters, and relations by
capital letters. In accordance with common usage, a disjunctive
combination of propositions is represented by the sign of addition,
and a conjunctive combination by simple juxtaposition (or, where it
is necessary for clearness, by the sign of multiplication): e.g. ‘a or
b or c’ is written ‘a + b + c,’ and ‘a and b and c’ is written ‘abc.’
‘a + b’ is not so interpreted as to exclude ‘a and b.’ The contradictory
of a is written a¯.
4. Preliminary Definitions:
I. If there exists a relation of probability P between the
proposition a and the premiss h
a/h = P. Def.
II. If P is the relation of certainty*
P = 1. Def.
III. If P is the relation of impossibility*
P = 0. Def.
IV. If P is a relation of probability, but not the relation of
certainty
P < 1. Def.
*These symbols were first employed by Leibnitz. See p. 155 below.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 148
V. If P is a relation of probability, but not the relation of
impossibility
P > 0. Def.
VI. If a/h = 0, the conjunction ah is inconsistent. Def.
VII. The class of propositions a such that a/h = 1 is the group
specified by h or (for short) the group h. Def.
VIII. If b/ah = 1 and a/bh = 1, (a = b)/h = 1. Def.
This may be regarded as the definition of Equivalence. Thus we
see that equivalence is relative to a premiss h. a is equivalent to b,
given h, if b follows from ah, and a from bh.
5. Preliminary Axioms:
We shall assume that there is included in every premiss with
which we are concerned the formal implications which allow us to
assert the following axioms:
(i.) Provided that a and h are propositions or conjunctions of
propositions or disjunctions of propositions, and that h is not an
inconsistent conjunction, there exists one and only one relation of
probability P between a as conclusion and h as premiss. Thus any
conclusion a bears to any consistent premiss h one and only one
relation of probability.
(ii.) If (a = b)/h = 1, and x is a proposition, x/ah = x/bh. This
is the Axiom of Equivalence.
(iii.) ( a + b = a¯
¯b )/h = 1
(aa = a)/h = 1
( a¯ = a )/h = 1
(ab + ¯ab = b)/h = 1.
If a/h = 1, ah = h.
That is to say, if a is included in the group specified by h, h and ah
are equivalent.
6. Addition and Multiplication.—If we were to assume that
probabilities are numbers or ratios, these operations could be given
ch. xii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 149
their usual arithmetical signification. In adding or multiplying
probabilities we should be simply adding or multiplying numbers.
But in the absence of such an assumption, it is necessary to give a
meaning by definition to these processes. I shall define the addition
and multiplication of relations of probabilities only for certain types
of such relations. But it will be shown later that the limitation thus
placed on our operations is not of practical importance.
We define the sum of the probable relations ab/h and a
¯b/h as
being the probable relation a/h; and the product of the probable
relations a/bh and b/h as being the probable relation ab/h. That is
to say:
IX. ab/h + a
¯b/h = ah. Def.
X. ab/h = a/bh  b/h = b/ah  a/h. Def.
Before we proceed to the axioms which will make these symbols
operative, the definitions may be restated in more familiar language.
IX. may be read: “The sum of the probabilities of ‘both a and b’
and of ‘a but not b,’ relative to the same hypothesis, is equal to the
probability of ‘a’ relative to this hypothesis.” X. may be read: “The
probability of ‘both a and b,’ assuming h, is equal to the product of
the probability of b, assuming h, and the probability of a, assuming
both b and h.” Or in the current terminology* we should have:
“The probability that both of two events will occur is equal to the
probability of the first multiplied by the probability of the second,
assuming the occurrence of the first.” It is, in fact, the ordinary
rule for the multiplication of the probabilities of events which are not
‘independent.’ It has, however, a much more central position in the
development of the theory than has been usually recognised.
Subtraction and division are, of course, defined as the inverse
operations of addition and multiplication:
XI. If PQ = R, P = R

XII. If P + Q = R, P = R - Q. Def.
Thus we have to introduce as definitions what would be axioms
if the meaning of addition and multiplication were already defined.
In this latter case we should have been able to apply the ordinary
processes of addition and multiplication without any further axioms.
As it is, we need axioms in order to make these symbols, to which we
have given our own meaning, operative. When certain properties are
associated, it is often more or less arbitrary which we take as defining
properties and which we associate with these by means of axioms. In
this case I have found it more convenient, for the purposes of formal
development, to reverse the arrangement which would come most
natural to common sense, full of preconceptions as to the meaning of
addition and multiplication. I define these processes, for the theory
of probability, by reference to a comparatively unfamiliar property,
and associate the more familiar properties with this one by means of
axioms. These axioms are as follows:
(iv.) If P, Q, R are relations of probability such that the products
PQ, PR and the sums P + Q, P + R exist, then:
(iv.a) If PQ exists, QP exists, and PQ = QP. If P + Q exists,
Q + P exists and P + Q = Q + P.
(iv.b) PQ < P unless Q = 1 or P = 0; P + Q > P unless Q = 0.
PQ = P if Q = 1 or P = 0; P + Q = P if Q = 0.
(iv.c) If PQ S PR, then Q S R unless P = 0. If P + Q S P + R,
then Q S R and conversely.
A meaning has not been given, it is important to notice, to the
signs of addition and multiplication between probabilities in all cases.
According to the definitions we have given, P + Q and PQ have not
an interpretation whenever P and Q are relations of probability, but
in certain conditions only. Furthermore, if P + Q = R and Q = S + T,
it does not follow that P + S + T = R, since no meaning has been
assigned to such an expression as P + S + T. The equation must
be written P + (S + T) = R, and we cannot infer from the foregoing
axioms that (P + S) + T = R. The following axioms allow us to make
ch. xii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 151
this and other inferences in cases in which the sum P + S exists, i.e.
when P + S = A and A is a relation of probability.
(v.) [±P ± Q] + [±R ± S] = [±P ± R] - [±Q ± S]
= [±P ± R] + [±Q ± S]
= [±P ± Q] - [±R ± S]
in every case in which the probabilities [±P ± Q], [±R ± S], [±P ± R],
etc., exist, i.e., in which these sums satisfy the conditions necessary
in order that a meaning may be given to them in the terms of our
definition.
(vi.) P(R ± S) = PR ± PS, if the sum R ± S and the products
PR and PS exist as probabilities.
7. From these axioms it is possible to derive a number of
propositions respecting the addition and multiplication of probabilities.
They enable us to prove, for instance, that if P + Q = R + S then
P-R = S-Q, provided that the differences P-R and S-Q exist; and
that (P+Q)(R+ S) = (P+Q)R+ (P+Q)S = [PR+QR]+[PS+QS] =
[PR+QS]+[QR+PS], provided that the sums and products in question
exist. In general any rearrangement which would be legitimate in
an equation between arithmetic quantities is also legitimate in an
equation between probabilities, provided that our initial equation and
the equation which finally results from our symbolic operations can
both be expressed in a form which contains only products and sums
which have an interpretation as probabilities in accordance with the
definitions. If, therefore, this condition is observed, we need not
complicate our operations by the insertion of brackets at every stage,
and no result can be obtained as a result of leaving them out, if it is
of the form prescribed above, which could not be obtained if they had
been rigorously inserted throughout. We can only be interested in
our final results when they deal with actually existent and intelligible
probabilities—for our object is, always, to compare one probability
with another—and we are not incommoded, therefore, in one symbolic
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 152
operations by the circumstance that sums and products do not exist
between every pair of probabilities.
8. Independence:
XIII. If a1/a2h = a1/h and a2/a1h = a2/h, the probabilities
a1/h and a2/h are independent. Def.
Thus the probabilities of two arguments having the same premisses
are independent, if the addition to the premisses of the conclusion of
either leaves them unaffected.
Irrelevance:
*
XIV. If a1/a2h = a1/h, a2 is irrelevant on the whole, or, for short,
irrelevant to a1/h. Def.
*This is repeated for convenience of reference from Chapter IV. § 14. It is
only necessary here to take account of irrelevance on the whole, not of the more
precise sense.
CHAPTER XIII
the fundamental theorems of necessary
inference
1. In this chapter we shall be mainly concerned with deducing
the existence of relations of certainty or impossibility, given other
relations of certainty or impossibility,—with the rules, that is to
say, of Certain or, as De Morgan termed it, of Necessary Inference.
But it will be convenient to include here a few theorems dealing
with intermediate degrees of probability. Except in one or two
important cases I shall not trouble to translate these theorems from
the symbolism in which they are expressed, since their interpretation
presents no difficulty.
2. (1) a/h + ¯a/h = 1.
For ab/h + ¯ab/h = b/h by IX.,
a/bh  b/h + ¯a/bh  b/h = b/h by X.
Put b/h = 1, then a/bh + ¯a/bh = 1 by (iv. b),
since b/h = 1, bh = h by (iii.).
Thus a/h + ¯a/h = 1 by (ii.).
(1.1) If a/h = 1, a/h ¯ = 0,
a/h + ¯a/h = 1 by (1),
? a/h + ¯a/h = a/h = a/h + 0 by (iv. b),
? a/h ¯ = 0 by (iv. c).
(1.2) Similarly, if a/h ¯ = 1, a/h = 0.
(1.3) If a/h = 0, a/h ¯ = 1,
a/h + ¯a/h = 1 by (1),
? 0 + ¯a/h = 0 + 1 by (iv. b),
? a/h ¯ = 1 by (iv. c).
153
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 154
(1.4) Similarly, if a/h ¯ = 0, a/h = 1.
(2) a/h < 1 or a/h = 1 by IV.
(3) a/h > 0 or a/h = 0 by V.,
i.e. there are no negative probabilities.
(4) ab/h < b/h or ab/h = b/h by X. and (iv. b).
If P and Q are relations of probability and P + Q = 0, then P = 0
and Q = 0.
P + Q > P unless Q = 0 by (iv. b),
and P > 0 unless P = 0 by V.
? P + Q > 0 unless Q = 0.
Hence, if P + Q = 0, Q = 0 and similarly P = 0.
(6) If PQ = 0, P = 0 or Q = 0,
Q > 0 unless Q = 0 by V.
Hence PQ > P  0 unless Q = 0 or P = 0 by (iv. c),
i.e. PQ > 0 unless Q = 0 or P = 0 by (iv. b).
Whence, if PQ = 0, the result follows.
(7) If PQ = 1, P = 1 and Q = 1,
PQ < P unless P = 0 or Q = 1 by (iv. b),
PQ = P if P = 0 or Q = 1 by (iv. b),
and P < 1 unless P = 1 by IV.,
? PQ < 1 unless P = 1.
ch. xiii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 155
Hence P = 1; similarly Q = 1.
(8) If a/h = 0, ab/h = 0 and a/bh = 0 if bh is not inconsistent.
For ab/h = b/ah  a/h = a/bh  b/h by X.,
and since a/h = 0, b/ah  a/h = 0 by (iv. b),
? ab/h = 0 and a/bh  b/h = 0,
? unless b/h = 0, a/bh = 0 by (5),
whence the result by VI.
Thus, if a conclusion is impossible, we may add to the conclusion
or add consistently to the premisses without affecting the argument.
(9) If a/h = 1, a/bh = 1 if bh is not inconsistent.
Since a/h = 1, a/h ¯ = 0 by (1.1),
? a/bh ¯ = 0 by (8) if bh is not inconsistent,
whence a/bh = 1 by (1.4).
Thus we may add to premisses, which make a conclusion certain,
any other premisses not inconsistent with them, without affecting the
result.
(10) If a/h = 1, ab/h = b/ah = b/h,
ab/h = b/ah  a/h = a/bh  b/h by X.
Since a/h = 1, a/bh = 1 by (9) unless b/h = 0,
? b/ah  a/h = b/ah and a/bh  b/h = b/h by (iv. b),
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 156
whence the result, unless b/h = 0. If b/h = 0, the result follows from
(8).
(11) If ab/h = 1, a/h = 1.
For ab/h = b/ah  a/h by X.,
? a/h = 1 by (7).
(12) If (a = b)/h = 1, a/h = b/h,
b/ah  a/h = a/bh  b/h by X.
and b/ah = 1, a/bh = 1 by VIII.,
? a/h = b/h by (iv. b).
(12.1) If (a = b)/h = 1 and hx is not inconsistent,
a/hx = b/hx.
a/hx  x/h = x/ah  a/h,
and b/hx  x/h = x/bh  b/h by X.,
x/ah = x/bh by (ii.),
and a/h = b/h by (12),
? a/hx = b/hx unless x/h = 0.
This is the principle of equivalence. In virtue of it and of axiom
(ii.), if (a = b)/h = 1, we can substitute a for b and vice versa,
wherever they occur in a probability whose premisses include h.
(13) a/a = 1, unless a is inconsistent.
For a/a = aa/a = a/aa  a/a by (iii.), (12), and X.,
whence a/aa = 1 by (ii.), unless a/a = 0,
i.e. a/a = 1, unless a is inconsistent by (iii.), (12), and VI.
(13.1) a/a ¯ = 0, unless a is inconsistent. This follows from
(13) and (1.1).
ch. xiii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 157
(13.2) a/a¯ = 0, unless a¯ is inconsistent. This follows from (iii.) by
writing a¯ for a in (13.1).
(14) If a/b = 0 and a is not inconsistent, b/a = 0.
Let f be the group of assumptions, common to a and b, which we
have supposed to be included in every real group;
then a/b = a/bf and b/a = b/af by (iii.) and (12),
and a/bf  b/f = b/af  a/f by X.
Since a/bf = 0 by hypothesis,
and a/f =| 0, since a is not inconsistent,
? b/af = 0,
whence b/a = 0.
Thus, if a is impossible given b, then b is impossible given a.
(15) If h1/h2 = 0, h1h2/h = 0,
h1/h2/h = h1/h2h  h2/h by X.,
and since h1/h2 = 0, h/h2h = 0 by (8), unless h/h2 = 0, whence the
result by (iv. b), unless h/h2 = 0.
If h/h2 = 0, h2/h = 0 by (14),
since we assume that h is not inconsistent, and hence
h1h2/h = 0 by (8).
Thus, if h1 is impossible given h2, h1h2 is always impossible and is
excluded from every group.
(15.1) If h1h2/h = 0 and h2h is not inconsistent, h1/h2h = 0. This,
which is the converse of (15), follows from X. and (6).
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 158
(16) If h1/h2 = 1, (h1 + h¯
2)/h = 1,
h¯
1/h2 = 0 by (1),
? h¯
1h2/h = 0 by (15),
? h1h2/h = 1 by (1.3),
? (h1 + h¯
2)/h = 1 by (12) and (iii.).
(16.1) We may write (16):
If h1/h2 = 1, (h2 ? h1)/h = 1, where ‘?’ symbolises ‘implies.’
Thus if h1 follows from h2, then it is always certain that h2 implies h1.
(16.2) If (h1 + h¯
2)/h = 1 and h2h is not inconsistent, h1/h2h =
1.
h¯
1h2/h = 0, as in (16),
? h¯
1/h2h = 0 by (15.1), since h2h is not inconsistent,
? h1/h2h = 1 by (1.4).
This is the converse of (14).
(16.3) We may write (16.2):
If (h2 ? h1)/h = 1 and h2h is not inconsistent, h1/h2h = 1. Thus,
if we define a ‘group’ as a set of propositions, which follow from and
are certain relatively to the proposition which specifies them, this
proposition proves that, if h2 ? h1 and h2 belong to a group h2h,
then h1 also belongs to this group.
(17) If (h1 ?: a = b)/h = 1 and h1h is not inconsistent,
a/h1h = b/h1h. This follows from (16.3) and (12).
(18) a/a = 1 or a/¯ a¯ = 1.
a/a ¯ = 1, unless a is inconsistent, by (13).
If a is inconsistent, a/h = 0, where h is not inconsistent, and
therefore
a/h ¯ = 1 by (1.3).
ch. xiii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 159
Thus unless a is inconsistent, a¯ is not inconsistent, and therefore
a/¯ a¯ = 1 by (13).
(19) aa/h ¯ = 0,
a/¯ a¯ = 1 or a/a = 1 by (18),
? a/a¯ = 0 or a/a ¯ = 0 by (1.1) and (1.2).
In either case aa/h ¯ = 0 by (15).
Thus it is impossible that both a and its contradictory should be
true. This is the Law of Contradiction.
(20) (a + ¯a)/h = 1.
Since (aa¯ = a + ¯a)/h = 1 by (iii.),
a + ¯a/h = 0 by (19) and (12),
? (a + ¯a)/h = 1 by (1.3).
Thus it is certain that either a or its contradictory is true. This is
the Law of Excluded Middle.
(21) If a/h1 = 1 and a/h2 = 0, h1h2/h = 0.
For a/h1h2  h1/h2 = h1/ah2  ah2,
and a/h ¯ 1h2  h2/h1 = h2/ah¯ 1  a/h ¯ 1 by X.,
? a/h1h2  h1/h2 = 0 and a/h ¯ 1h2  h2/h1 = 0,
since, by hypothesis and (1), a/h ¯ 1 = 0 and a/h2 = 0,
? a/h1h2 = 0 or h1/h2 = 0,
and a/h1h2 = 1 or h2/h1 = 0,
? h1/h2 = 0 or h2/h1 = 0.
In either case h1h2/h = 0 by (15).
Thus, if a proposition is certain relatively to one set of premisses,
and impossible relatively to another set, the two sets are incompatible.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 160
(22) If a/h1 = 0 and h1/h = 1, a/h = 0,
ah1/h = 0 by (15), ? h1/ah  a/h = 0,
h1/ah = 1 by (9), unless a/h = 0.
? in any case a/h = 0.
(23) If b/a = 0 and b/a¯ = 0, b/h = 0.
ab/h = 0 and ab/h ¯ = 0 by (15),
? a/bh = 0 or b/h = 0,
and a/bh ¯ = 0 or b/h = 0 by II. and (iv.),
whence b/h = 0 by (1.4).
CHAPTER XIV
the fundamental theorems of probable
inference
1. I shall give proofs in this chapter of most of the fundamental
theorems of Probability, with very little comment. The bearing of
some of them will be discussed more fully in Chapter XVI.
2. The Addition Theorems:
(24) (a + b)/h = a/h + b/h - ab/h.
In IX. write (a + b) for a, and ab¯ for b.
Then (a + b)¯ab/h + (a + b)ab/h ¯ = (a + b)/h,
whence ab/h ¯ + (a + b)(a + ¯b)/h = (a + b)/h by (iii.),
a/bh ¯  b/h + a/h = (a + b)/h by (iii.) and IX.
That is to say, (a + b)/h = a/h + (1 - a/bh)  b/h,
= a/h + b/h - ab/h.
In accordance with the principles of Chapter XII. § 6, this should
be written, strictly, in the form a/h + (b/h - ab/h), or in the form
b/h + (a/h - ab/h). The argument is valid, since the probability
(b/h - ab/h) is equal to ab/h ¯ , as appears from the preceding proof,
and, therefore, exists. This important theorem gives the probability
of ‘a or b’ relative to a given hypothesis in terms of the probabilities
of ‘a,’ ‘b,’ and ‘a and b’ relative to the same hypothesis.
(24.1) If ab/h = 0, i.e. if a and b are exclusive alternatives relative
to the hypothesis, then
(a + b)/h = a/h + b/h.
This is the ordinary rule for the addition of the probabilities of
exclusive alternatives.
161
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 162
(24.2) ab/h + ¯ab/h = b/h,
since ab + ¯ab = b by (iii.),
and aab/h ¯ = 0 by (19) and (8).
(24.3) (a + b)/h = a/h + ba/h ¯ . This follows from (24) and (24.2).
(24.4) (a + b + c)/h = (a + b)/h + c/h - (ac + bc)/h
= a/h + b/h + c/h
- ab/h - bc/h - ca/h + abc/h.
(24.5) And in general
(p1 + p2 + . . . + pn)/h =
Ppr/h -
Ppspt/h +
Pprpspt/h . . .
+ (-1)n - 1p1p2 . . . pn/h.
(24.6) If pspt/h = 0 for all pairs of values of s and t, it follows by
repeated application of X. that
(p1 + p2 + . . . + pn)/h =
Pn
1
pr/h.
(24.7) If pspt/h = 0, etc., and (p1 + p2 + . . . + pn)/h = 1, i.e. if
p1p2 . . . pn form, relatively to h, a set of exclusive and exhaustive
alternatives, then
Pn
1
pr/h = 1.
(25) If p1p2 . . . pn form, relative to h, a set of exclusive and
exhaustive alternatives,
a/h =
Pn
1
pra/h.
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 163
Since (p1 + p2 + . . . + pn)/h = 1 by hypothesis,
? (p1 + p2 + . . . + pn)/ah = 1 by (9) if ah is not inconsistent;
and since pspt/h = 0 by hypothesis,
? pspt/ah = 0 by (9), if ah is not inconsistent.
Hence Pn
1
pr/ah = (p1 + p2 + . . . + pn)/ah by (24.6)
= 1
Also pra/h = pr/ah  a/h.
Summing Pn
1
pra/h = a/h 
Pn
1
pr/ah,
? a/h =
Pn
1
pra/h, if ah is not inconsistent.
If ah is inconsistent, i.e. if a/h = 0 (for h is by hypothesis
consistent), the result follows at once by (8).
(25.1) If pra/h = Xr, the above may be written
pr/ah =
Xr
Pn
1
Xr
.
(26) a/h = (a + h¯)/h.
For (a + h¯)/h = a/h + h/h ¯ - ah/h ¯ by (24),
= a/h by (13.1) and (8).
(26.1) This may be written
a/h = (h ? a)/h.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 164
(27) If (a + b)/h = 0, a/h = 0.
a/h + [b/h - ab/h] = 0, by (24) and hypothesis
? a/h = 0. by (5)
(27.1) If a/h = 0 and b/h = 0, (a + b)/h = 0. This follows
from (24).
(28) If a/h = 1, (a + ¯b)/h = 1,
(a + ¯b)/h = a/h + ¯ba/h, ¯ by (24.3)
whence (a + ¯b)/h = a/h = 1 by (1.1) and (8), together with the
hypothesis. That is to say, a certain proposition is implied by every
proposition.
(28.1) If a/h = 0, (¯a + b)/h = 1 by substituting a¯ for a and b for ¯b
in (28). That is to say, a certainly false proposition implies every
proposition.
(29) If a/(h1 + h2) = 1, a/h1 = 1, a/h2 = 1.
a/¯ (h1 + h2) = 0,
and ? a¯(h1 + h2)/h1 = 0 by (15).
Hence ah¯ 1/h1 = 0 by (27),
whence the result.
(29.1) If a/h1 = 1 and a/h2 = 1, a/(h1 + h2) = 1.
As in (20) ah¯ 1/(h1 + h2) = 0 and ah¯ 2/(h1 + h2) = 0.
Hence a¯(h1 + h2)/(h1 + h2) = 0 by (27.1),
whence the result.
(29.2) If a/(h1 + h2) = 0, a/h1 = 0. This follows from (29).
(29.3) If a/h1 = 0 and a/h2 = 0, a/(h1 + h2) = 0. This follows
from (29.1).
3. Irrelevance and Independence:
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 165
(30) If a/h1h2 = a/h1, then a/h1h¯
2 = a/h1, if h1h¯
2 is not
inconsistent.
a/h1 = ah2/h1 + ah¯
2/h1 by (24.2),
= a/h1h2  h2/h1 + a/h1h¯
2  h¯
2/h1,
= a/h1  h2/h1 + a/h1h¯
2  h¯
2/h1,
? a/h1  h¯
2/h1 = a/h1h¯
2  h¯
2/h1,
whence a/h1 = a/h1h¯
2, unless h¯
2/h1 = 0, i.e. if h1h¯
2 is not
inconsistent.
Thus, if a proposition is irrelevant to an argument, then the
contradictory of the proposition is also irrelevant.
(31) If a2/a1h = a2/h and a2h is not inconsistent, a1/a2h = a1/h.
This follows by (iv. c), since a2/a1h  a1/h = a1/a2h  a2/h by X.
If, that is to say, a1 is irrelevant to the argument a2/h (see XIV.),
and a2 is not inconsistent with h: then a2 is irrelevant to the
argument a1/h; and a1/h and a2/h are independent (see XIII.).
4. Theorems of Relevance:
(32) If a/hh1 > a/h, h1/ah > h1/h.
ah is consistent since, otherwise, a/hh1 = a/h = 0.
Therefore a/h  h1/ah = a/hh1  h1/h by X.,
> a/h  h1/h by hypothesis;
so that h1/ah > h1/h.
Thus if h1 is favourably relevant to the argument a/h, a is
favourably relevant to the argument h1/h.
This constitutes a formal demonstration of the generally accepted
principle that if a hypothesis helps to explain a phenomenon, the fact
of the phenomenon supports the reality of the hypothesis.
In the following theorems p will be said to be more favourable
to a/h, than q is to b/h, if a/ph
a/h >
b/qh
b/h , i.e. if, in the language of
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 166
§ 8 below, the coefficient of influence of p on a/h is greater than the
coefficient of influence of q on b/h.
(33) If x is favourable to a/h, and h1 is not more favourable
to a/hx than x is to a/hh1, then h1 is favourable to a/h.
For a/hh1 = a/h 
a/hx
a/h 
a/hh1x
a/hx 
a/hh1
a/hh1x
; and by hypothesis the
second term on the right is greater than unity and the product of the
third and fourth terms is greater than or equal to unity.
(33.1) A fortiori, if x is favourable to a/h and not favourable
to a/hh1, and if h1 is not unfavourable to a/hx, then h1 is favourable
to a/h.
(34) If x is favourable to a/h, and h1 is not less favourable to x/ha
than x is to h1/ha, then h1 is favourable to a/h.
This follows by the same reasoning as (33), since by an application
of the Multiplication Theorem
a/hh1x
a/hx 
a/hh1
a/hh1x
=
x/hh1a
x/ha 
h1/ha
h1/hax.
(35) If x is favourable to a/h, but not more favourable to it
than h1x is, and not less favourable to it than to a/hh1, then h1 is
favourable to a/h.

This result is a little more substantial than the two preceding. By
judging the influence of x and h1x on the arguments a/h and a/hh1,
we can infer the influence of h1 by itself on the argument a/h.
5. The Multiplication Theorems:
(36) If a1/h and a2/h are independent, a1a2/h = a1/h 
a2/h.
For a1a2/h = a1/a2h  a2/h = a2/a1h  a1/h by X.,
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 167
and since a1/h and a2/h are independent,
a1/a2h = a1/h and a2/a1h = a2/h by XIII.
Therefore a1a2/h = a1/h  a2/h.
Hence, when a1/h and a2/h are independent, we can arrive at the
probability of a1 and a2 jointly on the same hypothesis by simple
multiplication of the probabilities a1/h and a2/h taken separately.
(37) If p1/h = p2/p1h = p3/p1p2h = . . .,
p1p2p3 . . . pn/h = {p1/h}
n
.
For p1p2p3 . . . /h = p1/h  p2/p1h  p3/p1p2h . . . by repeated applications
of X.
6. The Inverse Principle:
(38) a1/bh
a2/bh =
b/a1h
b/a2h

a1/h
a2/h, provided bh, a1h, and a2h are each
consistent.
For a1/bh  b/h = b/a1h  a1/h,
and a2/bh  b/h = b/a2h  a2/h by X.,
whence the result follows, since b/h =| 0, unless bh is inconsistent.
(38.1) If a1/h = p1, a2/h = p2, b/a1h = q1, b/a2h = q2,
and a1/bh + a2/bh = 1 then it easily follows that
a1/bh =
p1q1
p1q1 + p2q2
,
and a2/bh =
p2q2
p1q1 + p2q2
.
(38.2) If a1/h = a2/h the above reduces to
a1/bh =
q1
q1 + q2
,
and a2/bh =
q2
q1 + q2
,
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 168
since a1/h =| 0, unless a1h is inconsistent.
The proposition is easily extended to the cases in which the
number of a’s is greater than two.
It will be worth while to translate this theorem into familiar
language. Let b represent the occurrence of an event B, a1 and a2
the hypotheses of the existence of two possible causes A1 and A2
of B, and h the general data of the problem. Then p1 and p2 are the
à priori probabilities of the existence of A1 and A2 respectively, when
it is not known whether or not the event B has occurred; q1 and q2
the probabilities that each of the causes A1 and A2, if it exists, will
be followed by the event B. Then p1q1
p1q1 + p2q2
and p2q2
p1q1 + p2q2
are
the probabilities of the existence of A1 and A2 respectively after the
event, i.e. when, in addition to our other data, we know that the
event B has occurred. The initial condition, that bh must not be
inconsistent, simply ensures that the problem is a possible one, i.e.
that the occurrence of the event B is on the initial data at least
possible.
The reason why this theorem has generally been known as the
Inverse Principle of Probability is obvious. The causal problems to
which the Calculus of Probability has been applied are naturally
divided into two classes—the direct in which, given the cause, we
deduce the effect; the indirect or inverse in which, given the effect,
we investigate the cause. The Inverse Principle has been usually
employed to deal with the latter class of problem.
7. Theorems on the Combination of Premisses:
The Multiplication Theorems given above deal with the combination
of conclusions; given a/h1 and a/h2 we considered the relation
of a1a2/h to these probabilities. In this paragraph the corresponding
problem of the combination of premisses will be treated; given
a/h1 and a/h2 we shall consider the relation of a/h1h2 to these
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 169
probabilities.
(39) a/h1h2h =
ah1h2/h
h1h2/h =
ah1h2/h
ah1h2/h + ¯ah1h2/h by X. and (24.2)
=
u
u + v
,
where u is the à priori probability of the conclusion a and both
hypotheses h1 and h2 jointly, and v is the à priori probability of
the contradictory of the conclusion and both hypotheses h1 and h2
jointly.
(40) a/h1h2 =
ah1/h2
ah1/h2 + ¯ah1/h2
=
h1/ah2  q
h1/ah2  q + h1/ah¯ 2  (1 - q)
,
=
h2/ah1  p
h2/ah1  p + h2/ah¯ 1  (1 - p)
,
where p = a/h1 and q = a/h2.
(40.1) If p =
1
2
, a/h1h2 =
h2/ah1
h2/ah1 + h2/ah¯ 1
,
and increases with h2/ah1
h2/ah¯ 1
.
These results are not very valuable and show the need of an
original method of reduction. This is supplied by Mr. W. E. Johnson’s
Cumulative Formula, which is at present unpublished but which I
have his permission to print below.*
8. It is first of all necessary to introduce a new symbol. Let us
write
XV. a/bh = {a
h
b}a/h Def.
*The substance of propositions (41) to (49) below is derived in its entirety
from his notes,—the exposition only is mine.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 170
We may call {a
h
b} the coefficient of influence of b upon a on
hypothesis h.
XVI. {a
h
b}  {abh
c} = {a
h
b
h
c} Def.
and similarly {a
h
b}  {abh
cdh
e} = {a
h
b
h
cdh
e}.
These coefficients thus belong by definition to a general class of
operators, which we may call separative factors.
(41) ab/h = {a
h
b}  a/h  b/h,
since ab/h = a/bh  b/h.
Thus we may also call {a
h
b} the coefficient of dependence between
a and b on hypothesis h.
(41.1) abc/h = {a
h
b
h
c}  a/h  b/h  c/h.
For abc/h = {abh
c}ab/h  c/h by (41),
= {abh
c}  {a
h
b}  a/h  b/h  c/h by (41).
(41.2) And in general
abcd . . . /h = {a
h
b
h
c
h
d
h
. . .}  a/h  b/h  c/h  d/h . . .
(42) {a
h
b} = {b
h
a},
since a/bh  b/h = b/ah  a/h.
(42.1) {a
h
b
h
c} = a
h
c
h
b,
since a/h  b/h  c/h = a/h  c/h  b/h.
(42.2) And in general we have a commutative rule, by which the
order of the terms may be always commuted—
e.g. {a
h
bch
def h
g} = {bch
a
h
g
h
def}
{a
h
bch
def h
g} = {a
h
cbh
fedh
g}.
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 171
(43) As a multiplier the separative factor operates so as to separate
the terms that may be associated (or joined) in the multiplicand.
Thus {abh
cdh
e}  {a
h
b} = {a
h
b
h
cdh
e},
for abcde/h = {abh
cdh
e}  ab/h  cd/h  e/h
= {abh
cdh
e}  {a
h
b}  a/h  b/h  cd/h  e/h,
and also abcde/h = {a
h
b
h
cdh
e}  a/h  b/h  cd/h  e/h.
Similarly (for example)
{abch
d
h
ef}  {abh
c}  {a
h
b} = {a
h
b
h
c
h
d
h
ef}.
(44) {a
h
b}  {ab} = {a
h
b}.
For ab/h = {ab}ab/h.
By a symbolic convention, therefore, we may put {ab} = 1.
(44.1) If {a
h
b} = 1, it follows that a/h and b/h are independent
arguments; and conversely.
(45) Rule of Repetition {aah
b} = {a
h
b}.
For aab/h = ab/h by (vi.) and (12).

where variations of x are involved.
The cumulative formula is to be applied when, having accumulated
the evidence a, b, c . . ., we desire to know the comparative probabilities
of the various possible inferences x, x0
. . . which may be drawn, and
already know determinately the force of each of the items a, b, c . . .
separately as evidence for x, x0
. . ..
Besides the factors x/ah, x/bh, etc., we require to know two other
sets of values, viz.: (1) x/h, etc., i.e. the à priori probabilities of x,
etc., and (2) {a
xhb
xhc . . .}, etc., i.e. the coefficients of dependence
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 173
between a, b, and c . . . on hypotheses xh, etc. It may be remarked
that the values {a
xhb
xhc . . .}, {a
x
0h
b
x
0h
c . . .} . . . are not in any way
related, even when x
0 = x¯.
What corresponds to the cumulative formula has been employed,
sometimes, by mathematicians in a simplified form which is, except
under special conditions, incorrect. First, it has been tacitly assumed
that {a
xhb
xhc . . .}, {a
x
0h
b
x
0h
c . . .} . . . are all unity: so that
(x/h)
nx/habc . . . ? x/ah  x/bh  x/ch . . .
Secondly, the factor (x/h)
n has been omitted, so that
x/habc . . . ? x/ah  x/bh  x/ch . . .
It is this second incorrect statement of the formula which leads
to the fallacious rule for the combination of the testimonies of
independent witnesses ordinarily given in the text-books.*
(46.1). If abc . . . /xh = {a
xhb
xhc . . .}a/xh  b/xh  c/xh . . .
then x/habc . . . ? {a
xhb
xhc . . .}x/ah  x/bh  x/ch . . . .
This result is exceedingly interesting. Mr. Johnson is the first to
arrive at the simple relation, expressed above, between the direct
and the inverse formulæ: viz. that the same coefficient is required
for correcting the simple formulæ of multiplication in both cases.
As he remarks, however, while the direct formula gives the required
probability directly by multiplication, the inverse formula gives only
the comparative probability.

This follows at once from (46.2), since x and x¯ are exclusive and
exhaustive alternatives. (It is assumed that xh, xh¯ , and ah, etc., are
not inconsistent.)
This formula gives x/habc . . . in terms of x/ah, x/bh, etc., together
with the three values x/h, {a
xhb
xhc

This gives the effect on the odds (prob. x : prob. x¯) of the extra
knowledge a.
(49) When several data co-operate as evidence in favour of a
proposition, they continually strengthen their own mutual probabilities,
on the assumption that when the proposition is known to be
true or to be false the data jointly are not counterdependent.
I.e. if {a
xhb

x/kh > x/h where k is any of the data a, b, c . . ., then {a

We can show that each additional piece of evidence a, b, c . . .

value when all the evidence up to k exclusive is taken, so that
x/kh  G + ¯x/kh  G

is its value when k is taken. Now G > G0
since x/ah > x/h, etc.,
and x/ah < ¯ x/h ¯ , etc., by the hypothesis that the evidence favours x;
and for the same reason x/kh - x/h, which is equal to x/h ¯ - x/kh ¯ , is

Mr. Johnson describes this result as a generalisation of the
corrected “middle term fallacy” (see Chap. V. § 4).
APPENDIX
ON SYMBOLIC TREATMENTS OF PROBABILITY
The use of the symbol 0 for impossibility and 1 for certainty
was first introduced by Leibnitz in a very early pamphlet, entitled
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 177
Specimen certitudinis seu demonstrationum in jure, exhibitum in
doctrina conditionum, published in 1665 (vide Couturat, Logique
de Leibnitz, p. 553). Leibnitz represented intermediate degrees of
probability by the sign 1
2
, meaning, however, by this symbol a variable
between 0 and 1.
Several modern writers have made some attempt at a symbolic
treatment of Probability. But with the exception of Boole, whose
methods I have discussed in detail in Chapters XV., XVI., and XVII.,
no one has worked out anything very elaborate.
Mr. McColl published a number of brief notes on Probability of
considerable interest—see especially his Symbolic Logic, Sixth Paper
on the Calculus of Equivalent Statements, and On the Growth and Use
of a Symbolical Language. The conception of probability as a relation
between propositions underlies his symbolism, as it does mine.* The
probability of a, relative to the à priori premiss h, he writes a

;
and the probability, given b in addition to the à priori premiss, he
writes
a
b
. Thus a

=
a
h
, and a
b
= a/bh. The difference a
b
-
a

, i.e.
the change in the probability of a brought about by the addition of b
to the evidence, he calls ‘the dependence of the statement a upon
the statement b,’ and denotes it by d
a
b
. Thus d
a
b
= 0, where, in my
terminology, b is irrelevant to a on evidence h. The multiplication
and addition formulæ he gives as follows: ab

=
a


b
a
=
b


a
b
.
a + b


.
Also d
a
b
=
A
B

, where A = a

.
It is surprising how little use he succeeds in making of these good
*
I did not come across these notes until my own method was considerably
developed. Mr. McColl has been the first to use the fundamental symbol of
Probability.

In a paper entitled “Operations in Relative Number with Applications
to the Theory of Probabilities,” * Mr. B. I. Gilman attempted
a symbolic treatment based on a frequency theory similar to Venn’s,
but made more precise and more consistent with itself: “Probability
has to do, not with individual events, but with classes of events; and
not with one class, but with a pair of classes,—the one containing,
the other contained. The latter being the one with which we are
principally concerned, we speak, by an ellipsis, of its probability
without mentioning the containing class; but in reality probability
is a ratio, and to define it we must have both correlates given.”
But Mr. Gilman’s symbolic treatment leads to very little. More
recently R. Laemmel, in his Untersuchungen über die Ermittlung von
Wahrscheinlichkeiten, made a beginning on somewhat similar lines;
but in his case also the symbolic treatment leads to no substantial
results.
Apart from the writers mentioned above, there are a few who have
incidentally made use of a probability symbol. It will be sufficient
to cite Czuber.† He denotes the probability of an event E by W(E),
*Published in the volume of Johns Hopkins Studies in Logic.
†Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, vol. i. pp. 43–48.
ch. xiv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 179
and the probability of the event E given the occurrence of an event F
by WF(E). He uses this symbol to give WF(E) = WF¯ (E) as the
criterion of the independence of the events E and F (F¯ denoting the
non-occurrence of F); WF(E) = 1, as the expression of the fact that E
is a necessary consequence of F; and one or two other similar results.
Finally there is in the Bulletin of the Physico-mathematical Society
of Kazan for 1887 a memoir in Russian by Platon S. Porotzki entitled
“A Solution of the General Problem of the Theory of Probability by
Means of Mathematical Logic.” I have seen it stated that Schröder
intended to publish ultimately a symbolic treatment of Probability.
Whether he had prepared any manuscript on the subject before his
death I do not know.
CHAPTER XV
numerical measurement and approximation of
probabilities
1. The possibility of numerical measurement, mentioned at the
close of Chapter III., arises out of the Addition Theorem (24.1). In
introducing the definitions and the axiom, which are required in order
to make the convention of numerical measurement operative, we may
appear, as in the case of the original definitions of Addition and
Multiplication, to be arguing in an artificial way. This appearance
is due, here as in Chapter XII., to our having given the names
of addition and multiplication to certain processes of compounding
probabilities in advance of postulating that the processes in question
have the properties commonly associated with these names. As
common sense is hasty to impute the properties as soon as it hears
the names, it may overlook the necessity of formally introducing
them.
2. The definitions and the axiom which are needed in order to
give a meaning to numerical measurement are the following:—
XVII. a/h + {a/h + [a/h + (a/h + . . . r terms)]} = r  a/h. Def.
XVIII. If r  a/h = b/f, then a/h =
1
r
 b/f. Def.
XIX. If b/f = q  c/g, then 1
r
 b/f =
q
r
c/g. Def.
Thus if b/h = a/h + a/h + . . . to r terms, then the probability b/h
is said to be r times the probability a/h; hence if ab/h = 0 and
a/h = b/h, the probability (a + b)/h is twice the probability a/h. If
a and b are exhaustive as well as exclusive alternatives relatively to h,
so that (a + b)/h = 1, since we take the relation of certainty as our
unit, then a/h = b/h =
1
2
.
180
ch. xv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 181
We also need the following axiom postulating the existence of
relations of probability corresponding to all proper fractions:
(vii.) If q and r are any finite integers and q < r, there exists
a relation of probability which can be expressed, by means of the
convention of the foregoing definitions, as q
r
.
3. From these axioms and definitions combined with those
of Chapter XII., it is easy to show (certainty being represented by
unity and impossibility by zero) that we can manipulate according to
the ordinary laws of arithmetic the “numbers” which by means of a
special convention we have thus introduced to represent probabilities.
Of the kind of proofs necessary for the complete demonstration of
this the following is given as an example:
(50) If a/f =
1
m
and b/h =
1
n
, a/f + b/h =
m + n
mn
.
Let the probability 1
mn
= P, which exists by (vii.),
then n  P = 1
m
= a/f by (XIX.),
and m  P = 1
n
= b/h,
? a/f + b/h = n  P + m  P, if this probability exists,
= P + P . . . to n terms + P + P . . . to m terms,
= P + P . . . to m + n terms,
= (m + n)P = m + n
mn
by (XIX.).
This probability exists in virtue of (vii.).
4. Many probabilities—in fact all those which are equal to
the probability of some other argument which has the same premiss
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 182
and of which the conclusion is incompatible with that of the original
argument—are numerically measurable in the sense that there is some
other probability with which they are comparable in the manner
described above. But they are not numerically measurable in the
most usual sense, unless the probability with which they are thus
comparable is the relation of certainty. The conditions under which a
probability a/h is numerically measurable and equal to q
r
are easily
seen. It is necessary that there should exist probabilities a1/h1,
a2/h2 . . ., aq/hq . . . ar/hr, such that
a1/h1 = a2/h2 = . . . = aq/hq = . . . = ar/hr,
a/h =
P
q
1
as/hs, and Pr
1
as/hs = 1.
If a/h =
q1
r1
and b/h =
q2
r2
, it follows from (32) that ab/h =
q1q2
r1r2
only if a/h and b/h are independent arguments. Unless, therefore,
we are dealing with independent arguments, we cannot apply detailed
mathematical reasoning even when the individual probabilities are
numerically measurable. The greater part of mathematical probability,
therefore, is concerned with arguments which are both independent
and numerically measurable.
5. It is evident that the cases in which exact numerical
measurement is possible are a very limited class, generally dependent
on evidence which warrants a judgment of equiprobability by an
application of the Principle of Indifference. The fuller the evidence
upon which we rely, the less likely is it to be perfectly symmetrical
in its bearing on the various alternatives, and the more likely is it
to contain some piece of relevant information favouring one of them.
In actual reasoning, therefore, perfectly equal probabilities, and hence
exact numerical measures, will occur comparatively seldom.
The sphere of inexact numerical comparison is not, however, quite
so limited. Many probabilities, which are incapable of numerical
measurement, can be placed nevertheless between numerical limits.
ch. xv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 183
And by taking particular non-numerical probabilities as standards a
great number of comparisons or approximate measurements become
possible. If we can place a probability in an order of magnitude with
some standard probability, we can obtain its approximate measure by
comparison.
This method is frequently adopted in common discourse. When
we ask how probable something is, we often put our question in the
form—Is it more or less probable than so and so?—where ‘so and
so’ is some comparable and better known probability. We may thus
obtain information in cases where it would be impossible to ascribe
any number to the probability in question. Darwin was giving a
numerical limit to a non-numerical probability when he said of a
conversation with Lyell that he thought it no more likely that he
should be right in nearly all points than that he should toss up
a penny and get heads twenty times running.* Similar cases and
others also, where the probability which is taken as the standard of
comparison is itself non-numerical and not, as in Darwin’s instance, a
numerical one, will readily occur to the reader.
A specially important case of approximate comparison is that
of ‘practical certainty.’ This differs from logical certainty since its
contradictory is not impossible, but we are in practice completely
satisfied with any probability which approaches such a limit. The
phrase has naturally not been used with complete precision; but in its
most useful sense it is essentially non-numerical—we cannot measure
practical certainty in terms of logical certainty. We can only explain
how great practical certainty is by giving instances. We may say, for
instance, that it is measured by the probability of the sun’s rising
to-morrow. The type which we shall be most likely to take will be
that of a well-verified induction.
6. Most of such comparisons must be based on the principles of
Chapter V. It is possible, however, to develop a systematic method of
*Life and Letters, vol. ii. p. 240.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 184
approximation which may be occasionally useful. The theorems given
below are chiefly suggested by some work of Boole’s. His theorems
were introduced for a different purpose, and he does not seem to
have realised this interesting application of them; but analytically his
problem is identical with that of approximation.* This method of
approximation is also substantially the same analytically as that dealt
with by Mr. Yule under the heading of Consistence.
†
(51) xy/h always lies between‡ x/h and x/h+y/h-1 and between
y/h and x/h + y/h - 1.
For xy/h = x/h - xy/h ¯ by (24.2),
= x/h - y/h ¯  x/y/h ¯ by X.
Now x/yh¯ lies between 0 and 1 by (2) and (3),
? xy/h lies between x/h and x/h - y/h ¯ ,
i.e. between x/h and x/h + y/h - 1.
As xy/h <| 0, the above limits may be replaced by x/h and 0, if
x/h + y/h - 1 < 0.
*
In Boole’s Calculus we are apt to be left with an equation of the second or
of an even higher degree from which to derive the probability of the conclusion;
and Boole introduced these methods in order to determine which of the several
roots of his equation should be taken as giving the true solution of the problem
in probability. In each case he shows that that root must be chosen which
lies between certain limits, and that only one root satisfies this condition. The
general theory to be applied in such cases is expounded by him in Chapter XIX.
of The Laws of Thought, which is entitled “On Statistical Conditions.” But
the solution given in that chapter is awkward and unsatisfactory, and he
subsequently published a much better method in the Philosophical Magazine for
1854 (4th series, vol. viii.) under the title “On the Conditions by which the
Solutions of Questions in the Theory of Probabilities are limited.”
†Theory of Statistics, chap. ii.
‡
In this and the following theorems the term ‘between’ includes the limits.
ch. xv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 185
We thus have limits for xy/h, close enough sometimes to be useful,
which are available whether or not x/h and y/h are independent
arguments. For instance, if y/h is nearly certain, xy/h = x/h nearly,
quite independently of whether or not x and y are independent. This
is obvious; but it is useful to have a simple and general formula for
all such cases.
(52) x1x2 . . . xn+1/h is always greater than
nP
+1
1
xr/h - n.
For by (51) x1x2 . . . xn+1/h > x1x2 . . . xn/h + xn+1/h - 1
> x1x2 . . . xn-1/h + xn/h + xn+1/h - 2,
and so on.
(53) xy/h + ¯xy/h ¯ is always less than x/h - y/h + 1, and less than
y/h - x/h + 1.
For as in (51) xy/h = x/h - xy/h ¯
and x¯y/h ¯ = ¯y/h - xy/h, ¯
? xy/h + ¯xy/h ¯ = x/h - y/h + 1 - 2xy/h, ¯
whence the required result.
(54) xy/h - x¯y/h ¯ = x/h + y/h - 1.
This proposition, which follows immediately from the above, is
really out of place here. But its close connection with conclusions
(51) and (53) is obvious. It is slightly unexpected, perhaps, that the
difference of the probabilities that both of two events will occur and
that neither of them will, is independent of whether or not the events
themselves are independent.
7. It is not worth while to work out more of these results here.
Some less systematic approximations of the same kind are given in
the course of the solutions in Chapter XVII.
In seeking to compare the degree of one probability with that of
another we may desire to get rid of one of the terms, on account of its
not being comparable with any of our standard probabilities. Thus
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 186
our object in general is to eliminate a given symbol of quantity from
a set of equations or inequations. If, for instance, we are to obtain
numerical limits within which our probability must lie, we must
eliminate from the result those probabilities which are non-numerical.
This is the general problem for solution.
(55) A general method of solving these problems when we can throw
our equations into a linear shape so far as all symbols of probability
are concerned, is best shown in the following example:—
Suppose we have ? + ? = a (i.)
? + s = b (ii.)
? + ? + s = c (iii.)
? + µ + ? + ? = d (iv.)
? + µ + s + t = e (v.)
? + µ + ? + ? + s + t + ? = 1 (vi.)
where ?, µ, ?, ?, s, t , ? represent probabilities which are to be
eliminated, and limits are to be found for c in terms of the standard
probabilities a, b, d, e, and 1.
?, µ, etc., must all lie between 0 and 1.
From (i.) and (iii.) s = c - a; from (ii.) and (iii.) ? = c - b.
From (i.), (ii.), and (iii.) ? = a + b - c,
whence
c - a 1 0, c - b 1 0, a + b - c 1 0,
substituting for s, ?, ? in (iv.), (v.), and (vi.)
µ + ? = d - a, µ + t = e - b, µ + ? + t + ? = 1 - c,
whence
? = d - a - µ, t = e - b - µ, ? = 1 - c - d + a - e + b + µ,
? d - a - µ 1 0, e - b - µ 1 0, 1 - c - d + a - e + b + µ 1 0.
ch. xv FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 187
We have still to eliminate µ.
µ 1 d - a, µ 1 e - b,
µ 1 c + d + e - a - b - 1,
? d - a 1 c + d + e - a - b - 1 and e - b 1 c + d + e - a - b - 1.
Hence we have:
Upper limits of c:—b + 1 - e, a + 1 - d, a + b (whichever is least),
Lower limits of c:—a, b (whichever is greatest).
This example, which is only slightly modified from one given by
Boole, represents the actual conditions of a well-known problem in
probability.
CHAPTER XVI
observations on the theorems of chapter xiv.
and their developments, including testimony
1. In Definition XIII. of Chapter XII. a meaning was given to
the statement that a1/h and a2/h are independent arguments. In
Theorem (33) of Chapter XIV. it was shown that, if a1/h and a2/h
are independent, a1a2/h = a1/h  a2/h. Thus where on given evidence
there is independence between a1 and a2, the probability on this
evidence of a1a2 jointly is the product of the probabilities of a1 and a2
separately. It is difficult to apply mathematical reasoning to the
Calculus of Probabilities unless this condition is fulfilled; and the
fulfilment of the condition has often been assumed too lightly. A good
many of the most misleading fallacies in the theory of Probability
have been due to a use of the Multiplication Theorem in its simplified
form in cases where this is illegitimate.
2. These fallacies have been partly due to the absence of a
clear understanding as to what is meant by Independence. Students
of Probability have thought of the independence of events, rather
than of the independence of arguments or propositions. The one
phraseology is, perhaps, as legitimate as the other; but when we speak
of the dependence of events, we are led to believe that the question
is one of direct causal dependence, two events being dependent if
the occurrence of one is a part cause or a possible part cause of
the occurrence of the other. In this sense the result of tossing a
coin is dependent on the existence of bias in the coin or in the
method of tossing it, but it is independent of the actual results of
other tosses; immunity from smallpox is dependent on vaccination,
but is independent of statistical returns relating to immunity; while
the testimonies of two witnesses about the same occurrence are
independent, so long as there is no collusion between them.
This sense, which it is not easy to define quite precisely, is at
188
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 189
any rate not the sense with which we are concerned when we deal
with independent probabilities. We are concerned, not with direct
causation of the kind described above, but with ‘dependence for
knowledge,’ with the question whether the knowledge of one fact or
event affords any rational ground for expecting the existence of the
other. The dependence for knowledge of two events usually arises, no
doubt, out of causal connection, or what we term such, of some kind.
But two events are not independent for knowledge merely because
there is an absence of direct causal connection between them; nor,
on the other hand, are they necessarily dependent because there is
in fact a causal train which brings them into an indirect connection.
The question is whether there is any known probable connection,
direct or indirect. A knowledge of the results of other tossings of
a coin may be hardly less relevant than a knowledge of the bias of
the coin; for a knowledge of these results may be a ground for a
probable knowledge of the bias. There is a similar connection between
the statistics of immunity from smallpox and the causal relations
between vaccination and smallpox. The truthful testimonies of two
witnesses about the same occurrence have a common cause, namely
the occurrence, however independent (in the legal sense of the absence
of collusion) the witnesses may be. For the purposes of probability
two facts are only independent if the existence of one is no indication
of anything which might be a part cause of the other.
3. While dependence and independence may be thus connected
with the conception of causality, it is not convenient to found our
definition of independence upon this connection. A partial or possible
cause involves ideas which are still obscure, and I have preferred
to define independence by reference to the conception of relevance,
which has been already discussed. Whether there really are material
external causal laws, how far causal connection is distinct from logical
connection, and other such questions, are profoundly associated with
the ultimate problems of logic and probability and with many of
the topics, especially those of Part III., of this treatise. But I have
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 190
nothing useful to say about them. Nearly everything with which I
deal can be expressed in terms of logical relevance. And the relations
between logical relevance and material cause must be left doubtful.
4. It will be useful to give a few examples out of writers who, as
I conceive, have been led into mistakes through misapprehending the
significance of Independence.
Cournot,*
in his work on Probability, which after a long period of
neglect has come into high favour with a modern school of thought
in France, distinguishes between ‘subjective probability’ based on
ignorance and ‘objective probability’ based on the calculation of
‘objective possibilities,’ an ‘objective possibility’ being a chance event
brought about by the combination or convergence of phenomena
belonging to independent series. The existence of objectively
chance events depends on his doctrine that, as there are series
of phenomena causally dependent, so there are others between the
causal developments of which there is independence. These objective
possibilities of Cournot’s, whether they be real or fantastic, can have,
however, small importance for the theory of probability. For it is
not known to us what series of phenomena are thus independent. If
we had to wait until we knew phenomena to be independent in this
sense before we could use the simplified multiplication theorem, most
mathematical applications of probability would remain hypothetical.
5. Cournot’s ‘objective probability,’ depending wholly on
objective fact, bears some resemblances to the conception in the
minds of those who adopt the frequency theory of probability. The
proper definition of independence on this theory has been given most
clearly by Mr. Yule† as follows:
“Two attributes A and B are usually defined to be independent,
within any given field of observation or ‘universe,’ when the chance of
finding them together is the product of the chances of finding either of
*For some account of Cournot, see Chapter XXIV. § 3.
†
“Notes on the Theory of Association of Attributes in Statistics,” Biometrika,
vol. ii. p. 125.
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 191
them separately. The physical meaning of the definition seems rather
clearer in a different form of statement, viz. if we define A and B
to be independent when the proportion of A’s amongst the B’s of
the given universe is the same as in that universe at large. If, for
instance, the question were put, ‘What is the test for independence of
smallpox attack and vaccination?’ the natural reply would be, ‘The
percentage of vaccinated amongst the attacked should be the same as
in the general population.’. . . ”
This definition is consistent with the rest of the theory to which
it belongs, but is, at the same time, open to the general objections
to it.* Mr. Yule admits that A and B may be independent in the
world at large but not in the world of C’s. The question therefore
arises as to what world given evidence specifies, and whether any step
forward is possible when, as is generally the case, we do not know
for certain what the proportions in a given world actually are. As in
the case of Cournot’s independent series, it is in general impossible
that we should know whether A and B are or are not independent in
this sense. The logical independence for knowledge which justifies our
reasoning in a certain way must be something different from either of
these objective forms of independence.
6. I come now to Boole’s treatment of this subject. The
central error in his system of probability arises out of his giving two
inconsistent definitions of ‘independence.’† He first wins the reader’s
*See Chapter VIII.
†Boole’s mistake was pointed out, accurately though somewhat obscurely, by
H. Wilbraham in his review “On the Theory of Chances developed in Professor
Boole’s Laws of Thought” (Phil. Mag. 4th series, vol. vii., 1854). Boole failed
to understand the point of Wilbraham’s criticism, and replied hotly, challenging
him to impugn any individual results (“Reply to some Observations published
by Mr. Wilbraham,” Phil. Mag. 4th series, vol. viii., 1854). He returned to
the same question in a paper entitled “On a General Method in the Theory
of Probabilities,” Phil. Mag. 4th series, vol. viii., 1854, where he endeavours to
support his theory by an appeal to the Principle of Indifference. McColl, in his
“Sixth Paper on Calculus of Equivalent Statements,” saw that Boole’s fallacy
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 192
acquiescence by giving a perfectly correct definition: “Two events are
said to be independent when the probability of the happening of
either of them is unaffected by our expectation of the occurrence or
failure of the other.” * But a moment later he interprets the term
in quite a different sense; for, according to Boole’s second definition,
we must regard the events as independent unless we are told either
that they must concur or that they cannot concur. That is to say,
they are independent unless we know for certain that there is, in fact,
an invariable connection between them. “The simple events, x, y, z,
will be said to be conditioned when they are not free to occur in
every possible combination; in other words, when some compound
event depending upon them is precluded from occurring. . . . Simple
unconditioned events are by definition independent.” †
In fact as
long as xz is possible, x and z are independent. This is plainly
inconsistent with Boole’s first definition, with which he makes no
attempt to reconcile it. The consequences of his employing the term
independence in a double sense are far-reaching. For he uses a
method of reduction which is only valid when the arguments to which
it is applied are independent in the first sense, and assumes that it is
valid if they are independent in the second sense. While his theorems
are true if all the propositions or events involved are independent in
the first sense, they are not true, as he supposes them to be, if the
events are independent only in the second sense. In some cases this
mistake involves him in results so paradoxical that they might have
led him to detect his fundamental error.‡ Boole was almost certainly
turned on his definition of Independence; but I do not think he understood, at
least he does not explain, where precisely Boole’s mistake lay.
*Laws of Thought, p. 255. The italics in this quotation are mine.
†Op. cit. p. 258.
‡There is an excellent instance of this, Laws of Thought, p. 286. Boole
discusses the problem: Given the probability p of the disjunction ‘either Y
is true, or X and Y are false,’ required the probability of the conditional
proposition, ‘If X is true, Y is true.’ The two propositions are formally
equivalent; but Boole, through the error pointed out above, arrives at the result
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 193
led into this error through supposing that the data of a problem can
be of the form, “Prob. x = p,” i.e. that it is sufficient to state that
the probability of a proposition is such and such, without stating to
what premisses this probability is referred.*
It is interesting that De Morgan should have given, incidentally,
a definition of independence almost identical with Boole’s second
definition: “Two events are independent if the latter might have
existed without the former, or the former without the latter, for
anything that we know to the contrary” †
7. In many other cases errors have arisen, not through a
misapprehension of the meaning of independence, but merely through
careless assumptions of it, or through enunciating the Theorem
of Multiplication without its qualifying condition. Mathematicians
have been too eager to assume the legitimacy of those complicated
processes of multiplying probabilities, for which the greater part of
the mathematics of probability is engaged in supplying simplifications
cp
1 - p + cp
, where c is the probability of ‘If either Y is true, or X and Y false,
X is true.’ His explanation of the paradox amounts to an assertion that, so long
as two propositions, which are formally equivalent when true, are only probable,
they are not necessarily equivalent.
*
In studying and criticising Boole’s work on Probability, it is very important
to take into account the various articles which he contributed to the Philosophical
Magazine during 1854, in which the methods of The Laws of Thought are
considerably improved and modified. His last and most considered contribution
to Probability is his paper “On the application of the Theory of Probabilities
to the question of the combination of testimonies or judgments,” to be found in
the Edin. Phil. Trans. vol. xxi., 1857. This memoir contains a simplification and
general summary of the method originally proposed in The Laws of Thought,
and should be regarded as superseding the exposition of that book. In spite of
the error already alluded to, which vitiates many of his conclusions, the memoir
is as full as are his other writings of genius and originality.
†
“Essay on Probabilities” in the Cabinet Encyclopaedia, p. 26. De Morgan is
not very consistent with himself in his various distinct treatises on this subject,
and other definitions may be found elsewhere. Boole’s second definition of
Independence is also adopted by Macfarlane, Algebra of Logic, p. 21.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 194
and approximate solutions. Even De Morgan was careless enough in
one of his writings*
to enunciate the Multiplication Theorem in the
following form: “The probability of the happening of two, three, or
more events is the product of the probabilities of their happening
separately (p. 398). . . . Knowing the probability of a compound event,
and that of one of its components, we find the probability of the
other by dividing the first by the second. This is a mathematical
result of the last too obvious to require further proof (p. 401).”
An excellent and classic instance of the danger of wrongful
assumptions of independence is given by the problem of determining
the probability of throwing heads twice in two consecutive tosses of
a coin. The plain man generally assumes without hesitation that
the chance is (
1
2
)
2
. For the à priori chance of heads at the first
toss is 1
2
, and we might naturally suppose that the two events are
independent,—since the mere fact of heads having appeared once can
have no influence on the next toss. But this is not the case unless
we know for certain that the coin is free from bias. If we do not
know whether there is bias, or which way the bias lies, then it is
reasonable to put the probability somewhat higher than (
1
2
)
2
. The
fact of heads having appeared at the first toss is not the cause of
heads appearing at the second also, but the knowledge, that the coin
has fallen heads already, affects our forecast of its falling thus in the
future, since heads in the past may have been due to a cause which
will favour heads in the future. The possibility of bias in a coin, it
may be noticed, always favours ‘runs’; this possibility increases the
probability both of ‘runs’ of heads and of ‘runs’ of tails.
This point is discussed at some length in Chapter XXIX. and
further examples will be given there. In this chapter, therefore, I will
do no more than refer to an investigation by Laplace and to one real
and one supposed fallacy of Independence of a type with which we

8. Laplace, in so far as he took account at all of the
considerations explained in § 7, discussed them under the heading of
Des inégalités inconnues qui peuvent exister entre les chances que l’on
suppose égales.
*
In the case, that is to say, of the coin with unknown
bias, he held that the true probability of heads even at the first toss
differed from 1
2
by an amount unknown. But this is not the correct
way of looking at the matter. In the supposed circumstances the
initial chances for heads and tails respectively at the first toss really
are equal. What is not true is that the initial probability of ‘heads
twice’ is equal to the probability of ‘heads once’ squared.
Let us write ‘heads at first toss’ = h1; ‘heads at second toss’
= h2. Then h1/h = h2/h =
1
2
, and h1h2/h = h2/h1h  h1/h. Hence
h1h2/h = {h1/h}
2 only if h2/h1h = h2/h, i.e. if the knowledge that
heads has fallen at the first toss does not affect in the least the
probability of its falling at the second. In general, it is true
that h2/h1h will not differ greatly from h2/h (for relative to most
hypotheses heads at the first toss will not much influence our
expectation of heads at the second), and 1
4 will, therefore, give a
good approximation to the required probability. Laplace suggests an
ingenious method by which the divergence may be diminished. If we
throw two coins and define ‘heads’ at any toss as the face thrown by
the second coin, he discusses the probability of ‘heads twice running’
with the first coin. The solution of this problem involves, of course,
particular assumptions, but they are of a kind more likely to be
realised in practice than the complete absence of bias. As Laplace
does not state them, and as his proof is incomplete, it may be worth
while to give a proof in detail.

9. Two other examples will complete this rather discursive
commentary. It has been supposed that by the Principle of Indifference
the probability of the existence of iron upon Sirius is 1
2
, and that
similarly the probability of the existence there of any other element
is also 1
2
. The probability, therefore, that not one of the 68 terrestrial
elements will be found on Sirius is (
1
2
)
68, and that at least one will be
found there is 1 -

1
2
68 or approximately certain. This argument, or
a similar one, has been seriously advanced. It would seem to prove
also, amongst many other things, that at least one college exactly
resembling some college at either Oxford or Cambridge will almost
certainly be found on Sirius. The fallacy is partly due, as has been
pointed out by Von Kries and others, to an illegitimate use of the
Principle of Indifference. The probability of iron on Sirius is not 1
2
.
But the result is also due to the fallacy of false independence. It
is assumed that the known existence of 67 terrestrial elements on
Sirius would not increase the probability of the sixty-eighth’s being
found there also, and that their known absence would not decrease
the sixty-eighth’s probability.*
10. The other example is that of Maxwell’s classic mistake in the
theory of gases.† According to this theory molecules of gas move with
*See Von Kries, Die Principien der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, p. 10.
Stumpf (Über den Begriff der mathem. Wahrscheinlichkeit, pp. 71–74) argues
that the fallacy results from not taking into account the fact that there might
be as many metals as atomic weights, and that therefore the chance of iron
is
1
z
, where z is the number of possible atomic weights. A. Nitsche (Vierteljsch.
f. wissensch. Philos., 1892) thinks that the real alternatives are 0, or only 1,
or only 2 . . . or 68 terrestrial elements on Sirius, and that these are equally
probable, the chance of each being 1
69
.
†
I take the statement of this from Bertrand’s Calcul des probabilités, p. 30.
Let me here quote a precocious passage on Probability regarded as a branch of
Logic, from a letter written by Maxwell in his nineteenth year (1850), befor
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 198
great velocity in every direction. Both the directions and velocities
are unknown, but the probability that a molecule has a given velocity
is a function of that velocity and is independent of the direction. The
maximum velocity and the mean velocity vary with the temperature.
Maxwell seeks to determine, on these conditions alone, the probability
that a molecule has a given velocity. His argument is as follows:
If f(x) represents the probability that the component of velocity
parallel to the axis of X is x, the probability that the velocity has
components x, y, z parallel to the three axes is f(x)f(y)f(z). Thus
if F(v) represents the probability of a total velocity v, we have
f(x)f(y)f(z) = F(v), where v
2 = x
2 + y
2 + z
2
. It is not difficult to
deduce from this (assuming that the functions are analytical) that
f(x) must be of the form Ge
-k
2x
2
.
It is generally agreed at the present time that this result is
erroneous. But the nature of the error is, I think, quite different from
what it is commonly supposed to be.
Bertrand,* Poincaré,† and Von Kries,‡ all cite this argument of
Maxwell’s as an illustration of the fallacy of Independence; and
argue that f(x), f(y), and f(z) cannot, as he assumes, represent
independent probabilities, if, as he also assumes, the probability of a
velocity is a function of that velocity. But it is not in this way that the
error in the result really arises. If we do not know what function of the
velocity the probability of that velocity is, a knowledge of the velocity
parallel to the axes of x and y tells us nothing about the velocity
he came up to Cambridge: “They say that Understanding ought to work by
the rules of right reason. These rules are, or ought to be, contained in Logic;
but the actual science of logic is conversant at present only with things either
certain, impossible, or entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to
reason on. Therefore the true logic for this world is the calculus of Probabilities,
which takes account of the magnitude of the probability which is, or ought to
be, in a reasonable man’s mind” (Life, page 143).

parallel to the axis of z. Maxwell was, I think, quite right to hold that
a mere assumption that the probability of a velocity is some function
of that velocity, does not interfere with the mutual independence of
statements as to the velocity parallel to each of the three axes. Let
us denote the proposition, ‘the velocity parallel to the axis of X is x’
by X(x), the corresponding propositions relative to the axes of Y
and Z by Y(y) and Z(z), and the proposition ‘the total velocity is v’
by V(v); and let h represent our à priori data. Then if X(x)/h = f(x)
it is a justifiable inference from the Principle of Indifference that
Y(y)/h = f(y) and Z(z)/h = f(z). Maxwell infers from this that
X(x)Y(y)Z(z)/h = f(x)f(y)f(z). That is to say, he assumes that
Y(y)/X(x)  h = Y(y)/h and that Z(z)/Y(y)  X(x)  h = Z(z)/h. I do
not agree with the authorities cited above that this is illegitimate.
So long as we do not know what function of the total velocity the
probability of that velocity is, a knowledge of the velocities parallel
to the axes of x and y has no bearing on the probability of a given
velocity parallel to the axis of z. But Maxwell goes on to infer that
X(x)Y(y)Z(z)/h = V(v)/h where v
2 = x
2 + y
2 + z
2
. It is here, and
in a very elementary way, that the error creeps in. The propositions
X(x)Y(y)Z(z) and V(v) are not equivalent. The latter follows from
the former, but the former does not follow from the latter. There
is more than one set of values x, y, z, which will yield the same
value v. Thus the probability V(v)/h is much greater than the
probability X(x)Y(y)Z(z)/h. As we do not know the direction of
the total velocity v, there are many ways, not inconsistent with our
data, of resolving it into components parallel to the axes. Indeed I
think it is a legitimate extension of the preceding argument to put
V(v)/h = f(v); for there is no reason for thinking differently about
the direction V from what we think about the direction X.
A difficulty analogous to this occurs in discussing the problem of
the dispersion of bullets over a target—a subject round which, on
account of a curiosity which it seems to have raised in the minds of
many students of probability, a literature has grown up of a bulk

disproportionate to its importance.
11. I now pass to the Principle of Inverse Probability, a theorem
of great importance in the history of the subject. With various
arguments which have been based upon it I shall deal in Chapter
XXX. But it will be convenient to discuss here the history of the
Principle itself and of attempts at proving it.
It first makes its appearance somewhat late in the history of the
subject. Not until 1763, when Bayes’s theorem was communicated
to the Royal Society,* was a rule for the determination of inverse
probabilities explicitly enunciated. It is true that solutions to
inductive problems requiring an implicit and more or less fallacious
use of the inverse principle had already been propounded, notably by
Daniel Bernoulli in his investigations into the statistical evidence in
favour of inoculation.† But the appearance of Bayes’s Memoir marks
the beginning of a new stage of development. It was followed in 1767
by a contribution from Michell‡
to the Philosophical Transactions on
the distribution of the stars, to which further reference will be made
in Chapter XXV. And in 1774 the rule was clearly, though not quite
accurately, enunciated by Laplace in his “Mémoire sur la probabilité
des causes par les évènemens” (Mémoires présentés à l’Académie des
Sciences, vol. vi., 1774). He states the principle as follows (p. 623):
*Published in the Phil. Trans. vol. liii., 1763, pp. 376–398. This Memoir
was communicated by Price after Bayes’s death; there was a second Memoir in
the following year (vol. liv. pp. 298–310), to which Price himself made some
contributions. See Todhunter’s History, pp. 299 et seq. Thomas Bayes was a
dissenting minister of Tunbridge Wells, who was a Fellow of the Royal Society
from 1741 until his death in 1761. A German edition of his contributions to
Probability has been edited by Timerding.

“Essai d’une nouvelle analyse de la mortalité causée par la petite vérole, et
des avantages de l’inoculation pour la prévenir,” Hist. de l’Acad., Paris, 1760
(published 1766). Bernoulli argued that the recorded results of inoculation
rendered it a probable cause of immunity. This is an inverse argument, though
Bayes’s theorem is not used in the course of it. See also D. Bernoulli’s Memoir
on the Inclinations of the Planetary Orbits.
‡Michell’s argument owes more, perhaps, to Daniel Bernoulli than to Bayes.
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 201
“Si un évènement peut être produit par un nombre n de causes
différentes, les probabilités de l’existence de ces causes prises de
l’évènement sont entre elles comme les probabilités de l’évènement
prises de ces causes; et la probabilité de l’existence de chacune d’elles
est égale à la probabilité de l’évènement prise de cette cause, divisée
par la somme de toutes les probabilités de l’évènement prises de
chacune de ces causes.”
He speaks as if he intended to prove this principle, but he only
gives explanations and instances without proof. The principle is not
strictly true in the form in which he enunciates it, as will be seen on
reference to theorems (38) of Chapter XIV.; and the omission of the
necessary qualification has led to a number of fallacious arguments,
some of which will be considered in Chapter XXX.
12. The value and originality of Bayes’s Memoir are considerable,
and Laplace’s method probably owes much more to it than is generally
recognised or than was acknowledged by Laplace. The principle,
often called by Bayes’s name, does not appear in his Memoir in the
shape given it by Laplace and usually adopted since; but Bayes’s
enunciation is strictly correct and his method of arriving at it shows
its true logical connection with more fundamental principles, whereas
Laplace’s enunciation gives it the appearance of a new principle
specially introduced for the solution of causal problems. The following
passage* gives, in my opinion, a right method of approaching the
problem: “If there be two subsequent events, the probability of the
second b
N
and the probability of both together P
N
, and, it being first
discovered that the second event has happened, from hence I guess
that the first event has also happened, the probability I am in the
right is P
b
.” If the occurrence of the first event is denoted by a and of
the second by b, this corresponds to ab/h = a/bh  b/h and therefore
*Quoted by Todhunter, op. cit. p. 296. Todhunter underrates the importance
of this passage, which he finds unoriginal, yet obscure.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 202
a/bh =
ab/h
b/h ; for ab/h =
P
N
, b/h =
b
N
, a/bh =
P
b
. The direct and
indeed fundamental dependence of the inverse principle on the rule
for compound probabilities was not appreciated by Laplace.
13. A number of proofs of the theorem have been attempted
since Laplace’s time, but most of them are not very satisfactory,
and are generally couched in such a form that they do no more
than recommend the plausibility of their thesis. Mr. McColl* gave a
symbolic proof, closely resembling theorem (38) when differences of
symbolism are allowed for; and a very similar proof has also been
given by A. A. Markoff.†
I am not acquainted with any other rigorous
discussion of it.
Von Kries‡ presents the most interesting and careful example of a
type of proof which has been put forward in one shape or another
by a number of writers. We have initially, according to this view, a
certain number of hypothetical possibilities, all equally probable, some
favourable and some unfavourable to our conclusion. Experience, or
rather knowledge that the event has happened, rules out a number of
these alternatives, and we are left with a field of possibilities narrower
than that with which we started. Only part of the original field or
Spielraum of possibility is now admissible (zulässig). Causes have
à posteriori probabilities which are proportional to the extent of their
occurrence in the now restricted field of possibility.
There is much in this which seems to be true, but it hardly
amounts to a proof. The whole discussion is in reality an appeal
to intuition. For how do we know that the possibilities admissible
à posteriori are still, as they were assumed to be à priori, equal
possibilities? Von Kries himself notices that there is a difficulty; and

account of Von Kries’s argument is much condensed.
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 203
I do not see how he is to avoid it, except by the introduction of an
axiom.
This was in fact the course taken by Professor Donkin in 1851, in
an article which aroused some interest in the Philosophical Magazine
at the time, but which has since been forgotten. Donkin’s theory
is, however, of considerable interest. He laid down as one of the
fundamental principles of probability the following:*
“If there be any number of mutually exclusive hypotheses h1h2h3 . . .
of which the probabilities relative to a particular state of information
are p1p2p3 . . ., and if new information be gained which changes
the probabilities of some of them, suppose of hm+1 and all that
follow, without having otherwise any reference to the rest, then the
probabilities of these latter have the same ratios to one another, after
the new information, that they had before.” †
Donkin goes on to say that the most important case is where
the new information consists in the knowledge that some of the
hypotheses must be rejected, without any further information as to
those of the original set which are retained. This is the proposition
which Von Kries requires.
As it stands, the phrase “without having otherwise any reference
to the rest” obviously lacks precision. An interpretation, however,
can be put upon it, with which the principle is true. If, given the
old information and the truth of one of the hypotheses h1 . . . hm to
the exclusion of the rest, the probability of what is conveyed by the
new information is the same whichever of the hypotheses h1 . . . hm
has been taken, then Donkin’s principle is valid. For let a be the old

14. Difficulties connected with the Inverse Principle have arisen,
however, not so much in attempts to prove the principle as in those
to enunciate it—though it may have been the lack of a rigorous
proof that has been responsible for the frequent enunciation of an
inaccurate principle.
It will be noticed that in the formula (38.2) the à priori
probabilities of the hypotheses a1 and a2 drop out if p1 = p2, and
the results can then be expressed in a much simpler shape. This
is the shape in which the principle is enunciated by Laplace for the
general case,* and represents the uninstructed view expressed with
great clearness by De Morgan:†
“Causes are likely or unlikely, just
in the same proportion that it is likely or unlikely that observed
events should follow from them. The most probable cause is that
from which the observed event could most easily have arisen.” If this
were true the principle of Inverse Probability would certainly be a
most powerful weapon of proof, even equal, perhaps, to the heavy
burdens which have been laid on it. But the proof given in Chapter
XIV. makes plain the necessity in general of taking into account the
à priori probabilities of the possible causes. Apart from formal proof
this necessity commends itself to careful reflection. If a cause is very
improbable in itself, the occurrence of an event, which might very
easily follow from it, is not necessarily, so long as there are other
possible causes, strong evidence in its favour. Amongst the many
writers who, forgetting the theoretic qualification, have been led into
*See the passage quoted above, p. 201.

“Essay on Probabilities,” in the Cabinet Encyclopædia, p. 27.
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 205
actual error, are philosophers as diverse as Laplace, De Morgan,
Jevons, and Sigwart, Jevons* going so far as to maintain that the
fallacious principle he enunciates is “that which common sense leads
us to adopt almost instinctively.”
15. The theory of the combination of premisses dealt with in
§§ 7, 8 of Chapter XIV. has not often been discussed, and the history
of it is meagre. Archbishop Whately† was led astray by a superficial
error, and De Morgan, adopting the same mistaken rule, pushed it
*Principles of Science, vol. i. p. 280.
†Logic, 8th ed. p. 211: “As in the case of two probable premisses, the
conclusion is not established except upon the supposition of their being both
true, so in the case of two distinct and independent indications of the truth of
some proposition, unless both of them fail, the proposition must be true: we
therefore multiply together the fractions indicating the probability of the failure
of each—the chances against it—and, the result being the total chances against
the establishment of the conclusion by these arguments, this fraction being
deducted from unity, the remainder gives the probability for it. E.g. a certain
book is conjectured to be by such and such an author, partly, 1st, from its
resemblance in style to his known works; partly, 2nd, from its being attributed
to him by some one likely to be pretty well informed. Let the probability of the
conclusion, as deduced from one of these arguments by itself, be supposed 2
5
,
and in the other case 3
7
; then the opposite probabilities will be 3
5
and 4
7
, which
multiplied together give 12
35 as the probability against the conclusion. . . .”
The Archbishop’s error, in that a negative can always be turned into an
affirmative by a change of verbal expression, was first pointed out by a mere
diocesan, Bishop Terrot, in the Edin. Phil. Trans. vol. xxi. The mistake is well
explained by Boole in the same volume of the Edin. Phil. Trans.: “A confusion
may here be noted between the probability that a conclusion is proved, and
the probability in favour of a conclusion furnished by evidence which does not
prove it. In the proof and statement of his rule, Archbishop Whately adopts
the former view of the nature of the probabilities concerned in the data. In the
exemplification of it, he adopts the latter.”

to the point of absurdity.* Bishop Terrot† approached the question
more critically. Boole’s‡
last and most considered contribution to
the subject of probability dealt with the same topic. I know of no
discussion of it during the past sixty years.
Boole’s treatment is full and detailed. He states the problem
as follows: “Required the probability of an event z, when two
circumstances x and y are known to be present,—the probability
of the event z, when we know only of the existence of the
circumstances x, being p, and the probability, when we only know of
the existence of y, being q.” § His solution, however, is vitiated by the
fundamental error examined in § 6 above. Two of his conclusions may
be mentioned for their plausibility, but neither is valid.
“If the causes in operation, or the testimonies borne,” he argues,
“are, separately, such as to leave the mind in a state of equipoise as
respects the event whose probability is sought, united they will but
produce the same effect.” If, that is to say, a/h1 =
1
2
and a/h2 =
1
2
,
he concludes that a/h1h2 =
1
2
. The plausibility of this is superficial.

“Theory of Probabilities,” Encyclopædia Metropolitana, p. 400. He shows by
means of it that “if any assertion appear neither likely nor unlikely in itself,
then any logical argument in favour of it, however weak the premisses, makes it
in some degree more likely than not—a theorem which will be readily admitted
on its own evidence.” He then gives an example: “à priori vegetation on the
planets is neither likely nor unlikely; suppose argument from analogy makes
it 3
10 ; then the total probability is 1
2 +
1
2

3
10 or 13
20 .” De Morgan seems to accept
without hesitation the conclusion to be derived from this, that everything which
is not impossible is as probable as not.

or observations is to be measured by that supposed probability of the event
à priori which those judgments or observations following thereupon would not
tend to alter,” is not correct if it means more than that the mean strength of

Consider, for example, the following instance: h1 = A is black and
B is black or white, h2 = B is black and A is black or white, a =
both A and B are black. Boole also concluded without valid reason
that a/h1h2 increases, the greater the à priori improbability of the
combination h1h2.
16. The theory of “Testimony” itself, the theory, that is to
say, of the combination of the evidence of witnesses, has occupied so
considerable a space in the traditional treatment of Probability that
it will be worth while to examine it briefly. It may, however, be
safely said that the principal conclusions on the subject set out by
Condorcet, Laplace, Poisson, Cournot, and Boole, are demonstrably
false. The interest of the discussion is chiefly due to the memory of
these distinguished failures.
It seems to have been generally believed by these and other
logicians and mathematicians*
that the probability of two witnesses
speaking the truth, who are independent in the sense that there is
no collusion between them, is always the product of the probabilities
that each of them separately will speak the truth.† On this basis
conclusions such as the following, for example, are arrived at:
X and Y are independent witnesses (i.e. there is no collusion
between them). The probability that X will speak the truth is x, that
Y will speak the truth is y. X and Y agree in a particular statement.
*Perhaps M. Bertrand should be registered as an honourable exception. At
least he points out a precisely analogous fallacy in an example where two
meteorologists prophesy the weather, Calcul des Probabilités, p. 31.

This list could be greatly extended.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 208
The chance that this statement is true is
xy
xy + (1 - x)(1 - y)
.
For the chance that they both speak the truth is xy, and the
chance that they both speak falsely is (1 - x)(1 - y). As, in this
case, our hypothesis is that they agree, these two alternatives are
exhaustive; whence the above result, which may be found in almost
every discussion of the subject.
The fallacy of such reasoning is easily exposed by a more exact
statement of the problem. For let a1 stand for “X1 asserts a,” and
let a/a1h = x1, where h, our general data, is by itself irrelevant to a,
i.e., x1 is the probability that a statement is true of which we only
know that X1 has asserted it. Similarly let us write b/b2h = x2
where b2 stands for “X2 asserts b.” The above argument then assumes
that, if X1 and X2 are witnesses who are causally independent in
the sense there is no collusion between them direct or indirect,
ab/a1b2h = a/a1h  b/b2h = x1x2.
But ab/a1b2h = a/a1bb2h  b/a1b2h, and this is not equal to x1x2
unless a/a1bb2h = a/a1h and b/a1b2h = b/b2h. It is not a sufficient
condition for this, as seems usually to be supposed, that X1 and X2
should be witnesses causally independent of one another. It is also
necessary that a and b, i.e. the propositions asserted by the witnesses,
should be irrelevant to one another and also each of them irrelevant
to the fact of the assertion of the other by a witness. If a knowledge
of a affects the probability either of b or of b1, it is evident that the
formula breaks down. In the one extreme case, where the assertions
of the two contradict one another, ab/a1b2h = 0. In the other
extreme, where the two agree in the same assertion, i.e. where a = b,
a/a1bb2h = 1 and not = a/a1h.
17. The special problem of the agreement of witnesses, who
make the same statement, can be best attacked as follows, a certain
amount of simplification being introduced. Let the general data h of
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 209
the problem include the hypothesis that X1 and X2 are each asked
and reply to a question to which there is only one correct answer.
Let ai = “Xi asserts a in reply to the question,” and mi = “Xi gives
the correct answer to the question.” Then
m1/a1h = x1 and m2/a2h = x2,
x1 and x2 being, in the conventional language of this problem, the
“credibilities” of the witnesses. We have, since the witnesses agree
and since a follows from miai and mi
follows from aai
,
m1/a1a2h = m1m2/a1a2h = m2/a1a2h;
a/aih = mi/aih;
a/aimih = 1; mi/aaih = 1.
Also, since the witnesses are, in the ordinary sense, “independent”
witnesses, a2/a1ah = a2/ah and a2/a1ah¯ = a2/ah¯ ; that is to say, the
probability of X2’s asserting a is independent of the fact of X1’s
having asserted a, given we know that a is, in fact, true or false, as
the case may be.
The probability that, if the witnesses agree, their assertion is true
is
a/a1a2h = m1/a1a2h =
m1a2/a1h
a2/a1h
=
a2/a1m1h.m1/a1h
a2a/a1h + a2a/a ¯ 1h
=
a2/a1ah.x1
a2/a1ah.x1 + a2/a1ah. ¯ (1 - x2)
.
If this is to be equal to x1x2
x1x2 + (1 - x1)(1 - x2)
, we must have
a2/a1ah
a2/a1ah¯
=
x2
1 - x2
.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 210

=
aa2/h

a/a ¯ 2h
.
a/h ¯
a/h
=
x2
1 - x2
.
a/h ¯
a/h.
This then is the assumption which has tacitly slipped into the
conventional formula,—that a/h = ¯a/h =
1
2
. It is assumed, that is
to say, that any proposition taken at random is as likely as not to
be true, so that any answer to a given question is, à priori, as
likely as not to be correct. Thus the conventional formula ought
to be employed only in those cases where the answer which the
“independent” witnesses agree in giving is, à priori and apart from
their agreement, as likely as not.
18. A somewhat similar confusion has led to the controversy
as to whether and in what manner the à priori improbability of a
statement modifies its credibility in the mouth of a witness whose
degree of reliability is known. The fallacy of attaching the same
weight to a testimony regardless of the character of what is asserted,
is pointed out, of course, by Hume in the Essay on Miracles, and his
argument, that the great à priori improbability of some assertions
outweighs the force of testimony otherwise reliable, depends on the
avoidance of it. The correct is also taken by Laplace in his Essai
philosophique (pp. 98–102), where he argues that a witness is less
to be believed when he asserts an extraordinary fact, declaring the
opposite view (taken by Diderot in the article on “Certitude” in the
Encyclopédie) to be inconceivable before “le simple bon sens.”
The manner in which the resultant probability is affected depends
upon the precise meaning we attach to “degree of reliability” or
“coefficient of credibility.” If a witness’s credibility is represented
by x, do we mean that, if a is the true answer, the probability of his
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 211
giving it is x, or do we mean that if he answers a the probability of
a’s being true is x? These two things are not equivalent.
Let a1 stand for “a is asserted by the witness”; h1 for our evidence
bearing on the witness’s veracity; and h2 for other evidence bearing
on the truth of a. Let a/h1h2, i.e. the à priori probability of a apart
from our knowledge of the fact that the witness has asserted it, be
represented by p.
Let a/a1h1 = x1 and a1/ah1 = x2; so that x1 =
a/h1
a1/h1
 x2. In
general a/h1 6= a1/h1. Do we mean by the witness’s credibility x1
or x2?
We require a/a1h1h2.
Let a1/ah¯ 1 = r, i.e. the probability, apart from our special
knowledge concerning a, that, if a is false, the witness will hit on that
particular falsehood.
a/a1h1h2 =
a1/ah1h2  a/h1h2
a1/h1h2
=
x2p
a1a/h1h2 + a1a/h ¯ 1h2
=
x2p
x2p + a1/ah¯ 1h2  (1 - p)
=
x2p
x2p + r(1 - p)
;
for a1/ah1h2 = a1/ah1 and a1/ah¯ 1h2 = a1/ah¯ 1, since, given certain
knowledge concerning a, h2 is irrelevant to the probability of a1.
19. Generally speaking, all problems, in regard to the
combination of testimonies or to the combination of evidence derived
from testimony with evidence derived from other sources, may be
treated as special instances of the general problem of the combination
of arguments. Beyond pointing out the above plausible fallacies, there
is little to add. Mr. W. E. Johnson, however, has proposed a method
of defining credibility, which is sometimes valuable, because it regards
the witness’s credibility not absolutely, but with reference to a given
type of question, so that it enables us to measure the force of the
witness’s testimony under special circumstances. If a represents the
fact of A’s testimony regarding x, then we may define A’s credibility
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 212
for x as a, where a is given by the equation
x/ah = x/h + a
p
x/h  x/h ¯ ;
so that a
p
x/h  x/h ¯ measures the amount by which A’s assertion
of x increases its probability.
20. One of the most ancient problems in probability is concerned
with the gradual diminution of the probability of a past event, as the
length of the tradition increases by which it is established. Perhaps
the most famous solution of it is that propounded by Craig in his
Theologiae Christianae Principia Mathematica, published in 1699.*
He proves that suspicions of any history vary in the duplicate ratio
of the times taken from the beginning of the history in a manner
which has been described as a kind of parody of Newton’s Principia.
“Craig,” says Todhunter, “concluded that faith in the Gospel so far
as it depended on oral tradition expired about the year 880, and
that so far as it depended on written tradition it would expire in
the year 3150. Peterson by adopting a different law of diminution
concluded that faith would expire in 1789.” † About the same time
*See Todhunter’s History, p. 54. It has been suggested that the anonymous
essay in the Phil. Trans. for 1699 entitled “A Calculation of the Credibility of
Human Testimony” is due to Craig. In this it is argued that, if the credibilities
of a set of witnesses are p1 . . . pn, then if they are successive the resulting
probability is the product p1p2 . . . pn; if they are concurrent, it is:
1 - (1 - p1)(1 - p2). . .(1 - pn).
This last result follows from the supposition that the first witness leaves
an amount of doubt represented by 1 - p1; of this the second removes the
fraction p2, and so on. See also Lacroix, Traité élémentaire, p. 262. The above
theory was actually adopted by Bicquilley.
†
In the Budget of Paradoxes De Morgan quotes Lee, the Cambridge
Orientalist, to the effect that Mahometan writers, in reply to the argument that
the Koran has not the evidence derived from Christian miracles, contend that,
as evidence of Christian miracles is daily weaker, a time must at last arrive
when it will fail of affording assurance that they were miracles at all: whence
the necessity of another prophet and other miracles.
ch. xvi FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 213
Locke raised the matter in chap. xvi. bk. iv. of the Essay Concerning
Human Understanding: “Traditional testimonies the farther removed,
the less their proof. . . . No Probability can rise higher than its first
original.” This is evidently intended to combat the view that the
long acceptance by the human race of a reputed fact is an additional
argument in its favour and that a long tradition increases rather than
diminishes the strength of an assertion. “This is certain,” says Locke,
“that what in one age was affirmed upon slight grounds, can never
after come to be more valid in future ages, by being often repeated.”
In this connection he calls attention to “a rule observed in the law of
England, which is, that though the attested copy of a record be good
proof, yet the copy of a copy never so well attested, and by never
so credible witnesses, will not be admitted as a proof in Judicature.”
If this is still a good rule of law, it seems to indicate an excessive
subservience to the principle of the decay of evidence.
But, although Locke affirms sound maxims, he gives no theory
that can afford a basis for calculation. Craig, however, was the
more typical professor of probability, and in attempting an algebraic
formula he was the first of a considerable family. The last grand
discussion of the problem took place in the columns of the Educational
Times.
* Macfarlane† mentions that four different solutions have been
put forward by mathematicians of the problem: “A says that B says
that a certain event took place; required the probability that the event
did take place, p1 and p2 being A’s and B’s respective probabilities of
speaking the truth.” Of these solutions only Cayley’s is correct.
*Reprinted in Mathematics from the Educational Times, vol. xxvii.
†Algebra of Logic, p. 151. Macfarlane attempts a solution of the general
problem without success. Its solution is not difficult, if enough unknowns are
introduced, but of very little interest.
CHAPTER XVII
some problems in inverse probability, including
averages
1. The present chapter deals with ‘problems’—that is to
say, with applications to particular abstract questions of some of
the fundamental theorems demonstrated in Chapter XIV. It is
without philosophical interest and should probably be omitted by
most readers. I introduce it here in order to show the analytical
power of the method developed above and its advantage in ease and
especially in accuracy over other methods which have been employed.*
§ 2 is mainly based upon some problems discussed by Boole. §§ 3–7
deal with the fundamental theory connecting averages and laws of
error. §§ 8–11 treat discursively the Arithmetic Average, the Method
of Least Squares, and Weighting.
2. In the following paragraph solutions are given of some
problems posed by Boole in chapter xx. of his Laws of Thought.
Boole’s own method of solving them is constantly erroneous,† and the
difficulty of his method is so great that I do not know of any one
but himself who has ever attempted to use it. The term ‘cause’ is
frequently used in these examples where it might have been better
to use the term ‘hypothesis.’ For by a possible cause of an event no
more is here meant than an antecedent occurrence, the knowledge of
which is relevant to our anticipation of the event; it does not mean
an antecedent from which the event in question must follow.
(56) The à priori probabilities of two causes A1 and A2 are
c1 and c2 respectively. The probability that if the cause A1 occur, an
*Such examples as these might sometimes be set to test the wits of students.
The problems on Probability usually given are simply problems on mathematical
combinations. These, on the other hand, are really problems in logic.

I.–VI., for example, in the Laws of Thought, chap. xx., are all erroneous.

event E will accompany it (whether as a consequence of A1 or not),
is p1, and the probability that E will accompany A2, if A2 present
itself, is p2. Moreover, the event E cannot appear in the absence of
both the causes A1 and A2. Required the probability of the event E.
This problem is of great historical interest and has been called
Boole’s ‘Challenge Problem.’ Boole originally proposed it for solution
to mathematicians in 1851 in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical
Journal. A result was given by Cayley*
in the Philosophical Magazine,
which Boole declared to be erroneous.† He then entered the field
with his own solution.‡
“Several attempts at its solution,” he says,
“have been forwarded to me, all of them by mathematicians of
great eminence, all of them admitting of particular verification, yet
differing from each other and from the truth.” § After calculations of
considerable length and great difficulty he arrives at the conclusion
that u is the probability of the event E where u is that root of the
*Phil. Mag. 4th series, vol. vi.
†Cayley’s solution was defended against Boole by Dedekind (Crelle’s Journal,
vol. 1. p. 268). The difference arises out of the extreme ambiguity as to the
meaning of the terms as employed by Cayley.
‡
“Solution of a Question in the Theory of Probabilities,” Phil. Mag. 4th series,
vol. vii., 1854. This solution is the same as that printed by Boole shortly
afterwards in the Laws of Thought, pp. 321–326. In the Phil. Mag. Wilbraham
gave as the solution u = c1p1 + c2p2 - z, where z is necessarily less than either
c1p1 or c2p2. This solution is correct so far as it goes, but is not complete. The
problem is also discussed by Macfarlane, Algebra of Logic, p. 154.
§
In proposing the problem Boole had said: “The motives which have led
me, after much consideration, to adopt, with reference to this question, a course
unusual in the present day, and not upon slight grounds to be revived, are the
following: First, I propose the question as a test of the sufficiency of received
methods. Secondly, I anticipate that its discussion will in some measure add to
our knowledge of an important branch of pure analysis.” When printing his
own solution in the Laws of Thought, he adds, that the above “led to some
interesting private correspondence, but did not elicit a solution.”

equation
[1 - c1(1 - p1) - u] [1 - c2(1 - p2) - u]
1 - u
=
(u - c1p1)(u - c2p2)
c1p1 + c2p2 - u
which is not less than c1p1 and c2p2 and not greater than 1-c1(1-p1),
1 - c2(1 - p2) or c1p1 + c2p2.
This solution can easily be seen to be wrong. For in the case
where A1 and A2 cannot both occur, the solution is u = c1p1 + c2p2;
whereas Boole’s equations do not reduce to this simplified form. The
mistake which Boole has made is the one general to his system,
referred to in Chapter XVI., § 6.*
The correct solution, which is very simple, can be reached as
follows:
Let a1, a2, e assert the occurrences of the two causes and the
event respectively, and let h be the data of the problem.
Then we have a1/h = c1, a2/h = c2, e/a1h = p1, e/a2h = p2: we
require e/h. Let e/h = u, and let a1a2/eh = z. Since the event
cannot occur in the absence of both the causes,
e/a¯1a¯2h = 0.
It follows from this that a¯1a¯2/eh = 0, unless e/h = 0,
i.e. (a1 + a2)/eh = 1,
whence a1/eh + a2/eh = 1 + a1a2/eh by (24).
Now a1/eh =
c1p1
u
and a2/eh =
c2p2
u
,
? u =
c1p1 + c2p2
1 + z
,
where z is the probability after the event that both the causes were
present.
*Boole’s error is pointed out and a correct solution given in Mr. McColl’s
“Sixth Article on the Calculus of Equivalent Statements” (Proc. Lond. Math.
Soc. vol. xxviii. p. 562).
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 217
If we write ea1a2/h = y,
y = a1a2/eh  e/h = uz
so that u = (c1p1 + c2p2) - y.
Boole’s solution fails by attempting to be independent of y or z.
(56.1) Suppose that we wish to find limits for the solution which
are independent of y and z: then, since y 0 0, u 0 c1p1 + c2p2.
Again
e/h = ea¯1/h+ea1/h 0 a¯1/h+ea1/h 0 1-c2+c2p2 by (24.2) and (4).
Similarly e/h 0 -c2 + c2p2. From the same equations it appears that
e/h 0 c1p1 and c2p2.

the greatest of (

c2p2
and the least of
?
??

c1p1 + c2p2
1 - c1(1 - p1)
1 - c2(1 - p2).
It will be seen that these numerical limits are the same as the
limits obtained by Boole for the roots of his equations.
(56.2) Suppose that the à priori probabilities of the causes
c1 and c2 are to be eliminated. The only limit we then have is
u < p1 + p2.
(56.3) Suppose that one of the à priori probabilities c2 is to be
eliminated. We then have limits c1p1 0 u 0 1-c1 +c1p1. If, therefore,
c1 is large, u does not differ widely from c1p1.
(56.4) Suppose p2 is to be eliminated. We then have
c1p1 0 u 0 c1p1 + c2
0 c1p1 + 1 - c1.
If therefore c1 is large or c2 small, u does not differ widely
from c1p1.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 218
(56.5) If a1/a2h = a1/h, i.e. if our knowledge of each of the causes
is independent, we have a closer approximation. For
y = ea1a2/h = e/a1a2h  a1/a2h  a2/h = e/a1a2h  c1c2,
? u = c1p1 + c2p2 - c1c2  e/a1a2h,
? u > c1p1 + c2p2 - c1c2.
(57) We may now generalise (56) and discuss the case of n causes.
If an event can only happen as a consequence of one or more of
certain causes A1, A2, . . . An, and if c1 is the à priori probability of
the cause A1 and p1 the probability that, if the cause A1 be known
to exist, the event E will occur: required the probability of E.
This is Boole’s problem VI. (Laws of Thought, p. 336). As the
result of ten pages of mathematics, he finds the solution to be the
root lying between certain limits of an equation of the n
th degree
which he cannot solve. I know no other discussion of the problem.
The solution is as follows:
e/h = ea¯1/h + ea1/h = ea¯1/h + e/a1h  a1/h = ea¯1/h + c1p1 (i.)
ea¯1/h = ea¯1a¯2/h + ea¯1/a2h  a2/h = ea¯1a¯2/h + c2  ea¯1/a2h,

cause which would always produce the event under the circumstances
supposed. What is the probability that the phenomenon, being
observed n times, will occur the n + 1th ?
This is Boole’s problem X. (Laws of Thought, p. 358). Boole

3. The following is a common type of statistical problem.*
We are given a series of measurements, or observations, or estimates
of the true value of a given quantity; and we wish to determine
what function of these measurements will yield us the most probable
value of the quantity, on the basis of this evidence. The problem
is not determinate unless we have some good ground for making
an assumption as to how likely we are in each case to make errors
of given magnitudes. But such an assumption, with or without
justification, is frequently made.
The functions of the original measurements which we commonly
employ, in order to yield us approximations to the most probable
value of the quantity measured, are the various kinds of means or
averages—the arithmetic mean, for example, or the median. The
relation, which we assume, between errors of different magnitudes
and the probabilities that we have made errors of those magnitudes,
is called a law of error. Corresponding to each law of error which
we might assume, there is some function of the measurements which
represents the most probable value of the quantity. The object of the
following paragraphs is to discover what laws of error, if we assume
them, correspond to each of the simple types of average, and to
discover this by means of a systematic method.
4. Let us assume that the real value of the quantity is either
b1, . . . br . . . bn, and let ar represent the conclusion that the value is,
in fact, br. Further let xr represent the evidence that a measurement
has been made of magnitude yr.
If a measurement yp has been made, what is the probability that
the real value is bs? The application of the theorem of inverse
*The substance of §§ 3–7 has been printed in the Journal of the Royal
Statistical Society, vol. lxxiv. p. 323 (February 1911).
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 225
probability yields the following result:
as/xph =
xp/ash  as/h
rP=n
r=1
xp/arh  ar/h
(the number of possible values of the quantity being n), where
h stands for any other relevant evidence which we may have, in
addition to the fact that a measurement xp has been made.
Next, let us suppose that a number of measurements y1 . . . ym have
been made; what is now the probability that the real value is bs? We
require the value of as/x1x2 . . . xmh. As before,
as/x1x2 . . . xmh =
x1 . . . xm/ash  as/h
rP=x
r=1
x1 . . . xm/arh  ar/h
.
At this point we must introduce the simplifying assumption that,
if we knew the real value of the quantity, the different measurements
of it would be independent, in the sense that a knowledge of what
errors have actually been made in some of the measurements would
not affect in any way our estimate of what errors are likely to be made
in the others. We assume, in fact, that xr/xp . . . xsarh = xr/arh.
This assumption is exceedingly important. It is tantamount to the
assumption that our law of error is unchanged throughout the series
of observations in question. The general evidence h, that is to say,
which justifies our assumption of the particular law of error which we
do assume, is of such a character that a knowledge of the actual errors
made in a number of measurements, not more numerous than those
in question, are absolutely or approximately irrelevant to the question
of what form of law we ought to assume. The law of error which we
assume will be based, presumably, on an experience of the relative
frequency with which errors of different magnitudes have been made
under analogous circumstances in the past. The above assumption
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 226
will not be justified if the additional experience, which a knowledge
of the errors in the new measurements would supply, is sufficiently
comprehensive, relatively to our former experience, to be capable of
modifying our assumption as to the shape of the law of error, or if it
suggests that the circumstances, in which the measurements are being
carried out, are not so closely analogous as was originally supposed.
With this assumption, i.e. that x1, etc., are independent of one
another relatively to evidence arh, etc., it follows from the ordinary
rule for the multiplication of independent probabilities that
x1 . . . xm/ash =
q
Q=m
q=1
xq/ash.

q=1
xq/arh  ar/h.
The most probable value of the quantity under measurement, given
the m measurements y1, etc.—which is our quaesitum—is therefore
that value which makes the above expression a maximum. Since
the denominator is the same for all values of bs, we must find the
value which makes the numerator a maximum. Let us assume that
a1/h = a2/h = . . . = an/h. We assume, that is to say, that we have
no reason à priori (i.e. before any measurements have been made)
for thinking any one of the possible values of the quantity more likely
than any other. We require, therefore, the value of bs which makes
the expression
q
Q=m
q=1
xq/ash a maximum. Let us denote this value by y.
We can make no further progress without a further assumption. Let
us assume that xq/ash—namely, the probability of a measurement yq
assuming the real value to be bs—is an algebraic function f of yq
and bs, the same function for all values of yq and bs within the limits
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 227
of the problem.* We assume, that is to say, xq/ash = f(yq, bs), and
we have to find the value of bs, namely y, which makes
q
Q=m
q=1
f(yq, y)
a maximum. Equating to zero the differential coefficient of this
expression with respect to y, we have
q
P=m
q=1
f
0
(yq, y)
f(yq, y)
= 0,
† where
f
0 =
df
dy . This equation may be written for brevity in the form
P f
0
q
fq
= 0.
If we solve this equation for y, the result gives us the value of the
quantity under observation, which is most probable relatively to the
measurements we have made.
The act of differentiation assumes that the possible values of y
are so numerous and so uniformly distributed within the range
in question, that we may, without sensible error, regard them as
continuous.
5. This completes the prolegomena of the inquiry. We
are now in a position to discover what laws of error correspond
to given assumptions respecting the algebraic relation between the
measurements and the most probable value of the quantity, and vice
versa. For the law of error determines the form of f(yq, y). And the
form f(yq, y) determines the algebraic relation P f
0
q
fq
= 0 between the
measurements and the most probable value. It may be well to repeat
*Gauss, in obtaining the normal law of error, made, in effect, the more
special assumption that xq/ash is a function of eq only, where eq is the error
and eq = bs - yq. We shall find in the sequel that all symmetrical laws of
error, such that positive and negative errors of the same absolute magnitude
are equally likely, satisfy this condition—the normal law, for example, and the
simplest median law. But other laws, such as those which lead to the geometric
mean, do not satisfy it.
†Since none of the measurements actually made can be impossible, none of
the expressions f(yq, y) can vanish.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 228
that f(yq, y) denotes the probability to us that an observer will make
a measurement yq in observing a quantity whose true value we know
to be y. A law of error tells us what this probability is for all possible
values of yq and y within the limits of the problem.
(i.) If the most probable value of the quantity is equal to the
arithmetic mean of the measurements, what law of error does this
imply?

Any law of error of this type, therefore, leads to the arithmetic
mean of the measurements as the most probable value of the quantity
measured.

where zq is the absolute magnitude of the error in the measurement yq.
This is, clearly, only one amongst a number of possible solutions.
But with one additional assumption we can prove that this is the
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 229
only law of error which leads to the arithmetic mean. Let us assume
that negative and positive errors of the same absolute amount are
equally likely.
In this case fq must be of the form Be

A law of error, which leads to the geometric mean of the
observations as the most probable value of the quantity, has been
previously discussed by Sir Donald McAlister (Proceedings of the
Royal Society, vol. xxix. (1879) p. 365). His investigation depends
upon the obvious fact that, if the geometric mean of the observations
yields the most probable value of the quantity, the arithmetic mean
of the logarithms of the observations must yield the most probable
value of the logarithm of the quantity. Hence, if we suppose that the
logarithms of the observations obey the normal law of error (which
leads to their arithmetic mean as the most probable value of the
logarithms of the quantity), we can by substitution find a law of error
for the observations themselves which must lead to the geometric
mean of them as the most probable value of the quantity itself.
If, as before, the observations are denoted by yq, etc., and the
quantity by y, let their logarithms be denoted by lq, etc., and by l.
Then, if lq, etc., obey the normal law of error, f(lq, l) = Ae
-k
2
(lq-l)
2
.
Hence the law of error for yq, etc., is determined by
f(yq, y) = Ae
-k
2
(log yq-log y)
2
= Ae
-k
2
(log yq
y
)
2
,
and the most probable value of y must, clearly, be the geometric
mean of yq, etc.
This is the law of error which was arrived at by Sir Donald
McAlister. It can easily be shown that it is a special case of the
generalised form which I have given above of all laws of error leading
to the geometric mean. For if we put ?(yq) = -k

(log yq)

, and

.
A similar result has been obtained by Professor J. C. Kapteyn.*
But he is investigating frequency curves, not laws of error, and
this result is merely incidental to his main discussion. His method,
however, is not unlike a more generalised form of Sir Donald
McAlister’s. In order to discover the frequency curve of certain
quantities y, he supposes that there are certain other quantities z,
functions of the quantities y, which are given by z = F(y), and that
the frequency curve of these quantities z is normal. By this device
he is enabled in the investigation of a type of skew frequency curve,
which is likely to be met with often, to utilise certain statistical
constants corresponding to those which have been already calculated
for the normal curve.
In fact the main advantage both of Sir Donald McAlister’s
law of error and of Professor Kapteyn’s frequency curves lies in
the possibility of adapting without much trouble to unsymmetrical
phenomena numerous expressions which have been already calculated
for the normal law of error and the normal curve of frequency.†
This method of proceeding from arithmetic to geometric laws
of error is clearly capable of generalisation. We have dealt with
the geometric law which can be derived from the normal arithmetic
law. Similarly if we start from the simplest geometric law of
*Skew Frequency Curves, p. 22, published by the Astronomical Laboratory
at Groningen (1903).
†
It may be added that Professor Kapteyn’s monograph brings forward
considerations which would be extremely valuable in determining the types of
phenomena to which geometric laws of error are likely to be applicable.

positive and negative errors of the same absolute magnitude are not
equally likely.
(iv.) If the most probable value of the quantity is equal to the
median of the measurements, what is the law of error?
The median is usually defined as the measurement which occupies
the middle position when the measurements are ranged in order of
magnitude. If the number of measurements m is odd, the most
probable value of the quantity is the m + 1
2
th, and, if the number
is even, all values between the m
2
th and the m
2
+ 1
th are equally
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 233
probable amongst themselves and more probable than any other. For
the present purpose, however, it is necessary to make use of another
property of the median, which was known to Fechner (who first
introduced the median into use) but which seldom receives as much
attention as it deserves. If y is the median of a number of magnitudes,
the sum of the absolute differences (i.e. the difference always reckoned
positive) between y and each of the magnitudes is a minimum. The
median y of y1y2 . . . ym is found, that is to say, by making Pm
1
|yq - y|
a minimum where |yq - y| is the difference always reckoned positive
between yq and y.
We can now return to the investigation of the law of error
corresponding to the median.
Write |y - yq| = zq. Then since Pm
1
zq is to be a minimum we must
have Pm
1
y - yq
zq
= 0. Whence, proceeding as before, we have
fq = Ae
R y-yq
zq
f
00(y) dy+?(yq).
The simplest case of this is obtained by putting
f
00(y) = -k

?(yq) = y - yq
zq

yq,
whence fq = Ae

|y-yq| = Ae

.
This satisfies the additional condition that positive and negative
errors of equal magnitude are equally likely. Thus in this important
respect the median is as satisfactory as the arithmetic mean, and the
law of error which leads to it is as simple. It also resembles the
normal law in that it is a function of the error only, and not of the
magnitude of the measurement as well.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 234
The median law of error, fq = Ae
-k
2zq
, where zq is the absolute
amount of the error always reckoned positive, is of some historical
interest, because it was the earliest law of error to be formulated.
The first attempt to bring the doctrine of averages into definite
relation with the theory of probability and with laws of error was
published by Laplace in 1774 in a memoir “sur la probabilité des
causes par les événemens.” * This memoir was not subsequently
incorporated in his Théorie analytique, and does not represent his
more mature view. In the Théorie he drops altogether the law
tentatively adopted in the memoir, and lays down the main lines of
investigation for the next hundred years by the introduction of the
normal law of error. The popularity of the normal law, with the
arithmetic mean and the method of least squares as its corollaries, has
been very largely due to its overwhelming advantages, in comparison
with all other laws of error, for the purposes of mathematical
development and manipulation. And in addition to these technical
advantages, it is probably applicable as a first approximation to a
larger and more manageable group of phenomena than any other
single law. So powerful a hold indeed did the normal law obtain
on the minds of statisticians, that until quite recent times only a
few pioneers have seriously considered the possibility of preferring in
certain circumstances other means to the arithmetic and other laws
of error to the normal. Laplace’s earlier memoir fell, therefore, out of
remembrance. But it remains interesting, if only for the fact that a
law of error there makes its appearance for the first time.
Laplace sets himself the problem in a somewhat simplified form:
“Déterminer le milieu que l’on doit prendre entre trois observations
données d’un même phénomène.” He begins by assuming a law of
error z = f(y), where z is the probability of an error y; and finally, by
means of a number of somewhat arbitrary assumptions, arrives at the
result f(y) = m
2
e
-my. If this formula is to follow from his arguments,
*Mémoires présentés à l’Académie des Sciences, vol. vi.
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 235
y must denote the absolute error, always taken positive. It is not
unlikely that Laplace was led to this result by considerations other
than those by which he attempts to justify it.
Laplace, however, did not notice that his law of error led to the
median. For, instead of finding the most probable value, which would
have led him straight to it, he seeks the “mean of error”—the value,
that is to say, which the true value is as likely to fall short of as
to exceed. This value is, for the median law, laborious to find and
awkward in the result. Laplace works it out correctly for the case
where the observations are no more than three.
6. I do not think that it is possible to find by this method a law
of error which leads to the mode. But the following general formulae
are easily obtained:
(v.) If P?(yq, y) is the law of relation between the measurements
and the most probable value of the quantity, then the law of error
fq(yq, y) is given by fq = Ae
R
?(yqy)f
00(y) dy+?(yq)
. Since fq lies between
0 and 1,
R
?(yqy)f
00(y) dy + ?(yq) + log A must be negative for all
values of yq and y that are physically possible; and, since the values
of yq are between them exhaustive,
PAe
R
?(yqy)f
00(y) dy+?(yq) = 1,
where the summation is for all terms that can be formed by giving yq
every value à priori possible.
(vi.) The most general form of the law of error, when it is
assumed that positive and negative errors of the same magnitude are
equally probable, is Ae
-k
2f(y-yq)
2
, where the most probable value of
the quantity is given by the equation
P(y - yq)f
0
(y - yq)
2 = 0, where f
0
(y - yq)
2 =
d
d(y - yq)
2
f(y - yq)
2
.
The arithmetic mean is a special case of this obtained by putting
f(y - yq)
2 = (y - yq)
2
; and the median is a special case obtained by
putting f(y - yq)
2 = +p
(y - yq)
2
.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 236
We can obtain other special cases by putting
f(y - yq)
2 = (y - yq)
4
,
when the law of error is Ae
-k
2
(y-yq)
2
and the most probable values
are the roots of my3 - 3y
2 Pyq + 3y
Py
2
q -
Py
3
q = 0; and by putting
f(y - yq)
2 = log(y - yq)
2
, when the law of error is A
(y - yq)
= 0 and
the most probable values the roots of P 1
(y - yq)
= 0. In all these
cases the law is a function of the error only.
7. These results may be summarised thus. We have assumed:
(a) That we have no reason, before making measurements, for
supposing that the quantity we measure is more likely to have any
one of its possible values than any other.
(b) That the errors are independent, in the sense that a knowledge
of how great an error has been made in one case does not affect our
expectation of the probable magnitude of the error in the next.
(c) That the probability of a measurement of given magnitude,
when in addition to the à priori evidence the real value of the
quantity is supposed known, is an algebraic function of this given
magnitude of the measurement and of the real value of the quantity.
(d) That we may regard the series of possible values as continuous,
without sensible error.
(e) That the à priori evidence permits us to assume a law of error
of the type specified in (c); i.e. that the algebraic function referred to
in (c) is known to us à priori.
Subject to these assumptions, we have reached the following
conclusions:
(1) The most general form of the law of error is
fq = Ae
R
f
00(y)?(yqy) dy+?(yq)
,
leading to the equation P?(yqy) = 0, connecting the most probable
value and the actual measurements, where y is the most probable
value and yq, etc., the measurements.
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 237
(2) Assuming that positive and negative errors of the same
absolute magnitude are equally likely, the most general form is
fq = Ae
-k

2
, leading to the equation P(y - yq)f
0
(y - yq)
2 = 0,
where f

z =

arithmetic mean of the measurements as the most probable value of
the quantity; and
(4) fq = Ae

, leading to the median.
(5) The most general form leading to the arithmetic mean is

In each of these expressions, fq is the probability of a measurement
yq, given that the true value is y.
8. The doctrine of Means and the allied theory of Least Squares
comprise so extensive a subject-matter that they cannot be adequately
treated except in a volume primarily devoted to them. As, however,
they are one of the important practical applications of the theory of
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 238
probability, I am unwilling to pass them by entirely; and the following
discursive observations, chiefly relating to the Normal Law of Error,
will serve, taken in conjunction with the paragraphs immediately
preceding, to illustrate the connection between the theories of this
treatise and the general treatment of averages.
9. The Claims of the Arithmetic Average.—By definition the
arithmetic average of a number of quantities is nothing more than
their arithmetic sum divided by their number. But the utility of
an average generally consists in our supposed right to substitute, in
certain cases, this single measure for the varying measures of which
it is a function. Sometimes this requires no justification; the word
“average” is in these cases used for the sake of shortness, and merely
to summarise a set of facts: as, for instance, when we say that the
birth-rate in England is greater than the birth-rate in France.
But there are other cases in which the average makes a more
substantial claim to add to our knowledge. After a number of
examiners of equal capacity have given varying marks to a candidate
for the same paper, it may be thought fair to allow the candidate
the average of the different marks allotted: and in general if several
estimates of a magnitude have been made, between the accuracy of
which we have no reason to discriminate, we often think it reasonable
to act as if the true magnitude were the average of the several
measurements. Perhaps De Witt, in his report on Annuities to the
States General in 1671,* was the first to use it scientifically. But as
Leibniz points out: “Our peasants have made use of it for a long time
according to their natural mathematics. For example, when some
inheritance or land is to be sold, they form three bodies of appraisers;
these bodies are called Schurzen in Low Saxon, and each body makes
an estimate of the property in question. Suppose, then, that the
first estimates its value to be 1000 crowns, the second, 1400, the
third, 1500; the sum of these three estimates is taken, viz. 3900, and
*De vardye van de lif-renten na proportie van de los-renten. The Hague,
1671.
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 239
because they were three bodies, the third, i.e. 1300, is taken as the
mean value asked for. This is the axiom: aequalibus aequalia, equal
suppositions must have equal consideration.” *
But this is a very inadequate axiom. Equal suppositions would
have equal consideration, if the three estimates had been multiplied
together instead of being added. The truth is that at all times the
arithmetic mean has had simplicity to recommend it. It is always
easier to add than to multiply. But simplicity is a dangerous criterion:
“La nature,” says Fresnel, “ne s’est pas embarassée des difficultés
d’analyse, elle n’a évité que la complication des moyens.”
With Laplace and Gauss there began a series of attempts to
prove the worth of the arithmetic mean. It was discovered that
its use involved the assumption of a particular type of law of error
for the à priori probabilities of given errors. It was also found
that the assumption of this law led on to a more complicated rule,
known as the Method of Least Squares for combining the results of
observations which contain more than one doubtful quantity. In spite
of a popular belief that, whilst the Arithmetic Mean is intuitively
obvious, the Method of Least Squares depends upon doubtful and
arbitrary assumptions, it can be demonstrated that the two stand
and fall together.†
The analytical theorems of Laplace and Gauss are complicated, but
the special assumptions upon which they are based are easily stated.‡
*Nouveaux Essais. Engl. transl. p. 540.
†Venn (Logic of Chance, p. 40) thinks that the Normal Law of Error and
the Method of Least Squares “are not only totally distinct things, but they have
scarcely even any necessary connection with each other. The Law of Error is
the statement of a physical fact. . . . The Method of Least Squares, on the other
hand, is not a law at all in the scientific sense of the term. It is simply a rule
or direction. . . .”
‡For an account of the three principal methods of arriving at the Method of
Least Squares and the Arithmetic Mean, see Ellis, Least Squares. Gauss’s first
method is in the Theoria Motus, and his second in the Theoria Combinationis
Observationum. Laplace’s investigations are in chap. iv. of the second Book
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 240
Gauss supposes (a) that the probability of a given error is a function
of the error only and not also of the magnitude of the observation,
(b) that the errors are so small that their cubes and higher powers
may be neglected. Assumption (a) is arbitrary,* and Gauss did not
state it explicitly. These two assumptions, together with certain
others, lead us to the result. For let f(z) be the law of error where
z is the error, and let us assume, as it always is assumed in these
proofs, that f(z) can be expanded by Maclaurin’s Theorem. Then
f(x) = f(0)+zf0
(0)+ z
2
2! f
00(0)+ z
3
3! f
000(0)+. . .. It is also supposed that
positive and negative errors are equally probable, i.e. f(z) = f(-z),
so that f
0
(0) and f
000(0) vanish. Since we may neglect z
4
in comparison
with z
2
, fz = f(0) + 1
2
z
2f
00(0). But (neglecting z
4 and higher powers)
a + bz2 = ae
bz2
a , so that f(z) = ae
bz2
a .
Gauss’s proof looks much more complicated than this, but he
obtains the form ae
bz2
a by neglecting higher powers of z, so that this
expression is really equivalent to a + bz2
. By this approximation he
has reduced all the possible laws to an equivalent form.†
It is true,
therefore, that the normal law of error is, to the second power of the
error, equivalent to any law of error, which is a function of the error
only, and for which positive and negative errors are equally probable.
Laplace also introduces assumptions equivalent to these.
While mathematicians have endeavoured to establish the normal
law of error and the arithmetic mean as a law of logic, others have
claimed for it the testimony of experience and have deemed it a law
of nature.‡
of the Théorie analytique. Laplace’s method was improved by Poisson in the
Connaissance des temps for 1827 and 1832.
*
It does not follow, as G. Hagen argues (Grundzüge der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung,
p. 29), that, because a larger error is less probable than a smaller,
therefore the probability of a given error is a function of its magnitude only.
†This is pointed out by Bertrand, Calcul des probabilités, p. 267.
‡This is, of course, a very common point of view indeed. Cf. Bertrand,
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 241
That this cannot be so, is evident. For suppose that x1x2 . . . xn
are a set of observations of an unknown quantity x. Then, by
this principle, x =
1
n
Pxr gives the most probable value of x. But
suppose we had wished to determine x
2
, our observations, assuming
that we can multiply correctly, would be x
2
1
, x
2
2
. . . x2
n
, and the most
probable value of x
2 =
1
n
Px
2
r
. But (
1
n
Pxr)
2 =
1
n
Px
2
r
. And in
general, 1
n
Pf(xr) =| f(
1
n
Pxr). Nor is this a consideration which
can safely be ignored in practice. For our “observations” are often the
result of some manipulation, and the particular shape in which we
get them is not necessarily fixed for us. It is not easy to say what
the direct observation is. In particular if any such law of sensation,
as that enunciated by Fechner, is true (i.e. that sensation varies as
the logarithm of the stimulus), the arithmetic mean must break down
as a practical rule in all cases where human sensation is part of the
instrument by means of which the observations are recorded.*
Apart, however, from theoretical refutations, statisticians now
recognise that the arithmetic mean and the normal law of error can
only be applied to certain special classes of phenomena. Quetelet†
was, I think, the first to point this out. In England, Galton drew
attention to the fact many years ago, and Professor Pearson‡ has
shown “that the Gaussian-Laplace normal distribution is very far
from being a general law of frequency distribution either for errors
of observation or for the distribution of deviations from type such as
occur in organic populations. . . . It is not even approximately correct,
for example, in the distribution of barometric variations, of grades of
op. cit. p. 183: “Malgré les objections précédentes, la formule de Gauss doit être
adoptée. L’observation la confirme: cela doit suffire dans les applications.”
*This was noticed by Galton.
†E.g. Letters on the Theory of Probabilities, p. 114.

The following quotation is from his memoir On the General Theory of Skew
Correlation and Non-linear Regression, where further references are given.

fertility and incidence of disease.”
The Arithmetic Mean occupies, therefore, no unique position; and
it is worth while, from the point of view of probability, to discuss the
properties of other possible means and laws of error, as, for example,
on the lines indicated in the earlier part of this chapter.
10. The Method of Least Squares.—The problem, to which
this method is applied, is no more than the application of the
same considerations, as those which we have just been discussing, to
cases where the relation between the observed measurements and the
quantity whose most probable value we require, involves more than
one unknown.
Owing to the surprising character of its conclusions, if they
could be accepted as universally valid, and to the obscurity of the
mathematical fabric that has been reared on and about it, this
method has been surrounded by an unnecessary air of mystery. It
is true that in recent times scepticism has grown at the expense of
mystery. It is also true that just views have been held by individuals
for sixty years past, notably by Leslie Ellis. But the old mistakes are
not always corrected in the current text-books, and even so useful
and generally used a treatise on Least Squares, as Professor Mansfield
Merriman’s, opens with a series of very fallacious statements.
The controversial side of the Method of Least Squares is purely
logical; in the later developments there is much elaborate mathematics
of whose correctness no one is in doubt. What it is important to
state with the utmost possible clearness is the precise assumptions on
which the mathematics is based; when these assumptions have been
set forth, it remains to determine their applicability in particular
cases.
In dealing with averages we supposed ourselves to be presented
with a number of direct observations of some quantity which it is
desired to determine. But it is obvious that direct observations will be
in many cases either impracticable or inconvenient; and our natural
course will be to measure certain other quantities which we know
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 243
to bear fixed and invariable relations to the unknowns we wish to
determine. In surveying, for instance, or in astronomy, we constantly
prefer to take measurements of angles or distances in which we are
not interested for their own sakes, but which bear known geometrical
relationships to the set of ultimate unknowns.
If we wish to determine the most probable values of a set of
unknowns x1, x2, . . . xr, instead of obtaining a number of sets of
direct observations of each, we may obtain a number of equations of
observation of the following type:
a1x1 + a2x2 + . . . + arxr = V1,
b1x1 + b2x2 + . . . + brxr = V2,
. . . . . . .
k1x1 + k2x2 + . . . + krxr = Vn,
where V1, etc., are the quantities directly observed, and the a
0
s,
b
0
s, etc., are supposed known (n > r).
We have in such a case n equations to determine r unknowns, and
since the observations are likely to be inexact, there may be no precise
solution whatever. In these circumstances we wish to know the most
probable set of values of the x’s warranted by these observations.
The problem is precisely similar in kind to that dealt with by
averages and differs only in the degree of its complexity. It is
the problem of finding the most probable solution of such a set of
discrepant equations of observation that the Method of Least Squares
claims to solve.
By 1750 the astronomers were obtaining such equations of
observation in the course of their investigations, and the question
arose as to the proper manner of their solution. Boscovich in Italy,
Mayer and Lambert in Germany, Laplace in France, Euler in Russia,
and Simpson in England proposed different methods of solution.
Simpson, in 1757, was the first to introduce, by way of simplification,
the assumption or axiom that positive and negative errors are equally
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 244
probable.* The Method of Least Squares was first definitely stated
by Legendre in 1805, who proposed it as an advantageous method
of adjusting observations. This was soon followed by the ‘proofs’ of
Laplace and Gauss. But it is easily shown that these proofs involve
the normal law of error y = ke-k
2x
2
, and the theory of Least Squares
simply develops the mathematical results of applying to equations of
observation, which involve more than one unknown, that law of error
which leads to the Arithmetic Mean in the case of a single unknown.
11. The Weighting of Averages.—It is necessary to recur to the
distinction made at the beginning of § 9 between the two types to
which our average, or, as it is generally termed in social inquiries,
our index number, may belong. The average or index number may
simply summarise a set of facts and give us the actual value of a
composite quantity, as, for example, the index number of the cost
of living. In such cases the composite quantity, in which we are
interested, need not contain precisely the same number of units of
each of the elementary quantities of which it is composed, so that
the ‘weights,’ which denote the numbers of each elementary quantity
appropriate to the composite quantity, are part of the definition of
the composite quantity, and can no more be dispensed with than
the magnitudes of the elementary quantities themselves. Nor in such
cases is the rejection of discordant observations permissible; if, that is
to say, some of the elementary quantities are subject to much wider
variation, or to variations of a different type than the majority, that
is no reason for rejecting them.
On the other hand, the individual items, out of which the average
is composed, may each be indications or approximate estimates of
some one single quantity; and the average, instead of representing
*See Merriman’s Method of Least Squares, p. 181, for an historical sketch,
from which the above is taken. In 1877 Merriman published in the Transactions
of the Connecticut Academy a list of writings relating to the Method of Least
Squares and the theory of accidental errors of observation, which comprised
408 titles—classified as 313 memoirs, 72 books, 23 parts of books.
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 245
the measure of a composite quantity, may be selected as furnishing
the most probable value of the single quantity, given, as evidence of
its magnitude, the values of the various terms which make up the
average.
If this is the character of our average, the problem of weighting
depends upon what we know about the individual observations or
samples or indications, out of which our average is to be built up.
The units in question may be known to differ in respects relevant to
the probable value of the quaesitum. Thus there may be reasons,
quite apart from the actual results of the individual observations or
samples, for trusting some of them more than others. Our knowledge
may indicate to us, in fact, that the constants of the laws of error
appropriate to the several instances, even if the type of the law can
be assumed to be constant, should be varied according to the data
we possess about each. It may also indicate to us that the condition
of independence between the instances, which the method of averages
presumes, is imperfectly satisfied, and consequently that our mode of
combining the instances in an average must be modified accordingly.
Some modern statisticians, who, really influenced perhaps by practical
considerations, have been inclined to deprecate the importance
of weighting on theoretical grounds, have not always been quite clear
what kind of average they supposed themselves to be dealing with.
In particular, discussions of the question of weighting in connection
with index numbers of the value of money have suffered from this
confusion. It has not been clear whether such index numbers
really represent measures of a composite quantity or whether they
are probable estimates of the value of a single quantity formed by
combining a number of independent approximations towards the value
of this quantity. The original Jevonian conception of an index number
of the value of money was decidedly of the latter type. Modern
work on the subject has been increasingly dominated by the other
conception. A discussion of where the truth lies would lead me too
far into the field of a subject-matter alien to that of this treatise.
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 246
Theoretical arguments against weighting have sometimes been
based on the fact that to weight the items of the average in an
irrelevant manner, or, as it is generally expressed, in a random
manner, is not likely, provided the variations between the weights
are small compared with the variations between the items, to affect
the result very much. But why should any one wish to weight an
average “at random”? Such observations overlook the real meaning
and significance of weights. They are probably inspired by the fact
that a superficial treatment of statistics would sometimes lead to the
introduction of weights which are irrelevant. In drawing a conclusion,
for example, from the vital statistics of various towns, the figures of
population for the different towns may or may not be relevant to our
conclusion. It depends on the character of the argument. If they are
relevant, it may be right to employ them as weights. If they are
irrelevant, it must be wrong and unnecessary to do so. The fact that
what is a more important article of consumption than pins may, on
certain assumptions, be irrelevant to the usefulness of variations in the
price of each article as indications of variation in the value of money.
With other assumptions, it may be extremely relevant. Or again, we
may know that observations with a particular instrument tend to be
too large and must, therefore, be weighted down. It is contrary both
to theory and to common sense to suppose that the possession of
information as to the relative reliability of different statistics is not
useful. There is no place, therefore, in my judgment, for a generalised
argument as to the propriety or impropriety of weighting an average.
It should be added that, where we seek to build up an index
number of a conception, which is quantitative but is not itself
numerically measurable in any defined or unambiguous sense, by
combining a number of numerical quantities, which, while they do not
measure our quaesitum are nevertheless indications of its quantitative
variations and tend to fluctuate in the same sense, as, for example,
by means of what are sometimes called economic barometers of the
state of business, or the prosperity of the country or the like, some
ch. xvii FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS 247
very confusing questions can arise both as to what sort of a thing
our resulting index really is, and as to the mode of compilation
appropriate to it.
These confusing questions always arise when, instead of measuring
a quantity directly, we seek an index to fluctuations in its magnitude
by combining in an average the fluctuations of a series of magnitudes,
which are, each of them in a different way, to some extent (but only
to some extent), correlated with fluctuations in our quaesitum. I
must not burden this book with a discussion of the problems of Index
Numbers. But I venture to think that they would be sooner cleared
up if the natures and purposes of differing index numbers were more
sharply distinguished—those, namely, which are simply descriptive
of a composite commodity, those which seek to combine results
differing from one another in a way analogous to the variations of an
instrument of precision, and those which combine results, not of the
quaesitum itself, but of various other quantities, variations in which
are partly due to variations in the quaesitum, but which we well know
to be also due to other distinguishable influences. Index numbers
of the third type are often treated by methods and arguments only
appropriate to those of the second type.
12. The Rejection of Discordant Observations.—This differs
from the problem just discussed, because we have supposed so far
that our system of weighting is determined by data which we possess
prior to and apart from our knowledge of the actual magnitude of
the items of our average. The principle of the rejection of discordant
observations comes in when it is argued that, if one or more of our
observations show great discrepancies from the results of the greater
number, these ought to be partly or entirely neglected in striking the
average, even if there is no reason, except their discrepancy from the
rest, for attributing less weight to them than to the others. By some
this practice has been thought to be in accordance with the dictates
of common sense; by others it is denounced as savouring even of
pt. ii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 248
forgery.*
This controversy, like so many others in Probability, is due
to a failure to understand the meaning of ‘independence.’ The
mathematics of the orthodox theory of Averages and Least Squares
depend, as we have seen, upon the assumption that the observations
are ‘independent’; but this has sometimes been interpreted to mean
a physical independence. In point of fact, the theory requires that
the observations shall be independent, in the sense that a knowledge
of the result of some does not affect the probability that the others,
when known, involve given errors.
Clearly there may be initial data in relation to which this
supposition is entirely or approximately accurate. But in many cases
the assumption will be inadmissible. A knowledge of the results of a
number of observations may lead us to modify our opinion as to the
relative reliabilities of others.
The question, whether or not discordant observations should be
specially weighted down, turns, therefore, upon the nature of the
preliminary data by which we have been guided in initially adopting
a particular law of error as appropriate to the observations. If the
observations are, relevant to these data, strictly ‘independent,’ in the
sense required for probability, then rejection is not permissible. But
if this condition is not fulfilled, a bias against discordant observations
may be well justified.

induction and analogy
CHAPTER XVIII
introduction
Nothing so like as eggs; yet no one, on account of this apparent similarity,
expects the same taste and relish in all of them. ’Tis only after a long course
of uniform experiments in any kind, that we attain a firm reliance and security
with regard to a particular event. Now where is that process of reasoning, which
from one instance draws a conclusion, so different from that which it infers from
a hundred instances, that are no way different from that single instance? This
question I propose as much for the sake of information, as with any intention of
raising difficulties. I cannot find, I cannot imagine any such reasoning. But I
keep my mind still open to instruction, if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it
on me.—Hume.
*
1. I have described Probability as comprising that part of logic
which deals with arguments which are rational but not conclusive. By
far the most important types of such arguments are those which are
based on the methods of Induction and Analogy. Almost all empirical
science rests on these. And the decisions dictated by experience in the
ordinary conduct of life generally depend on them. To the analysis
and logical justification of these methods the following chapters are
directed.
Inductive processes have formed, of course, at all times a vital,
habitual part of the mind’s machinery. Whenever we learn by
experience, we are using them. But in the logic of the schools they
have taken their proper place slowly. No clear or satisfactory account
of them is to be found anywhere. Within and yet beyond the scope
of formal logic, on the line, apparently, between mental and natural
philosophy, Induction has been admitted into the organon of scientific
proof, without much help from the logicians, no one quite knows

when.
2. What are its distinguishing characteristics? What are the
qualities which in ordinary discourse seem to afford strength to an
inductive argument?
I shall try to answer these questions before I proceed to the
more fundamental problem—What ground have we for regarding such
arguments as rational?
Let the reader remember, therefore, that in the first of the
succeeding chapters my main purpose is no more than to state in
precise language what elements are commonly regarded as adding
weight to an empirical or inductive argument. This requires some
patience and a good deal of definition and special terminology. But
I do not think that the work is controversial. At any rate, I am
satisfied myself that the analysis of Chapter XIX. is fairly adequate.
In the next section, Chapters XX. and XXI., I continue in part
the same task, but also try to elucidate what sort of assumptions, if
we could adopt them, lie behind and are required by the methods
just analysed. In Chapter XXII. the nature of these assumptions is
discussed further, and their possible justification is debated.
3. The passage quoted from Hume at the head of this chapter
is a good introduction to our subject. Nothing so like as eggs, and
after a long course of uniform experiments we can expect with a firm
reliance and security the same taste and relish in all of them. The
eggs must be like eggs, and we must have tasted many of them. This
argument is based partly upon Analogy and partly upon what may
be termed Pure Induction. We argue from Analogy in so far as we
depend upon the likeness of the eggs, and from Pure Induction when
we trust the number of the experiments.
It will be useful to call arguments inductive which depend in any
way on the methods of Analogy and Pure Induction. But I do not
mean to suggest by the use of the term inductive that these methods
are necessarily confined to the objects of phenomenal experience and
to what are sometimes called empirical questions; or to preclude from
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 252
the outset the possibility of their use in abstract and metaphysical
inquiries. While the term inductive will be employed in this general
sense, the expression Pure Induction must be kept for that part of
the argument which arises out of the repetition of instances.
4. Hume’s account, however, is incomplete. His argument
could have been improved. His experiments should not have been
too uniform, and ought to have differed from one another as much
as possible in all respects save that of the likeness of the eggs. He
should have tried eggs in the town and in the country, in January
and in June. He might then have discovered that eggs could be good
or bad, however like they looked.
This principle of varying those of the characteristics of the
instances, which we regard in the conditions of our generalisation as
non-essential, may be termed Negative Analogy.
It will be argued later on that an increase in the number of
experiments is only valuable in so far as, by increasing, or possibly
increasing, the variety found amongst the non-essential characteristics
of the instances, it strengthens the Negative Analogy. If Hume’s
experiments had been absolutely uniform, he would have been right to
raise doubts about the conclusion. There is no process of reasoning,
which from one instance draws a conclusion different from that
which it infers from a hundred instances, if the latter are known to
be in no way different from the former. Hume has unconsciously
misrepresented the typical inductive argument.
When our control of the experiments is fairly complete, and the
conditions in which they take place are well known, there is not much
room for assistance from Pure Induction. If the Negative Analogies
are known, there is no need to count the instances. But where our
control is incomplete, and we do not know accurately in what ways
the instances differ from one another, then an increase in the mere
number of the instances helps the argument. For unless we know for
certain that the instances are perfectly uniform, each new instance
may possibly add to the Negative Analogy.
ch. xviii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 253
Hume might also have weakened his argument. He expects no
more than the same taste and relish from his eggs. He attempts no
conclusion as to whether his stomach will always draw from them the
same nourishment. He has conserved the force of his generalisation
by keeping it narrow.
5. In an inductive argument, therefore, we start with a number
of instances similar in some respects AB, dissimilar in others C. We
pick out one or more respects A in which the instances are similar,
and argue that some of the other respects B in which they are
also similar are likely to be associated with the characteristics A
in other unexamined cases. The more comprehensive the essential
characteristics A, the greater the variety amongst the non-essential
characteristics C, and the less comprehensive the characteristics B
which we seek to associate with A, the stronger is the likelihood or
probability of the generalisation we seek to establish.
These are the three ultimate logical elements on which the
probability of an empirical argument depends,—the Positive and the
Negative Analogies and the scope of the generalisation.
6. Amongst the generalisations arising out of empirical
argument we can distinguish two separate types. The first of
these may be termed universal induction. Although such inductions
are themselves susceptible of any degree of probability, they affirm
invariable relations. The generalisations which they assert, that is to
say, claim universality, and are upset if a single exception to them
can be discovered. Only in the more exact sciences, however, do we
aim at establishing universal inductions. In the majority of cases
we are content with that other kind of induction which leads up to
laws upon which we can generally depend, but which does not claim,
however adequately established, to assert a law of more than probable
connection.* This second type may be termed Inductive Correlation.
If, for instance, we base upon the data, that this and that and those
*What Mill calls ‘approximate generalisations.’
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 254
swans are white, the conclusion that all swans are white, we are
endeavouring to establish a universal induction. But if we base upon
the data that this and those swans are white and that swan is black,
the conclusion that most swans are white, or that the probability of
a swan’s being white is such and such, then we are establishing an
inductive correlation.
Of these two types, the former—universal induction—presents
both the simpler and the more fundamental problem. In this part of
my treatise I shall confine myself to it almost entirely. In Part V.,
on the Foundations of Statistical Inference, I shall discuss, so far as I
can, the logical basis of inductive correlation.
7. The fundamental connection between Inductive Method and
Probability deserves all the emphasis I can give it. Many writers,
it is true, have recognised that the conclusions which we reach
by inductive argument are probable and inconclusive. Jevons, for
instance, endeavoured to justify inductive processes by means of the
principles of inverse probability. And it is true also that much of
the work of Laplace and his followers was directed to the solution of
essentially inductive problems. But it has been seldom apprehended
clearly, either by these writers or by others, that the validity of every
induction, strictly interpreted, depends, not on a matter of fact, but
on the existence of a relation of probability. An inductive argument
affirms, not that a certain matter of fact is so, but that relative to
certain evidence there is a probability in its favour. The validity of
the induction, relative to the original evidence, is not upset, therefore,
if, as a fact, the truth turns out to be otherwise.
The clear apprehension of this truth profoundly modifies our
attitude towards the solution of the inductive problem. The validity
of the inductive method does not depend on the success of its
predictions. Its repeated failure in the past may, of course, supply
us with new evidence, the inclusion of which will modify the force
of subsequent inductions. But the force of the old induction relative
to the old evidence is untouched. The evidence with which our
ch. xviii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 255
experience has supplied us in the past may have proved misleading,
but this is entirely irrelevant to the question of what conclusion
we ought reasonably to have drawn from the evidence then before
us. The validity and reasonable nature of inductive generalisation is,
therefore, a question of logic and not of experience, of formal and not
of material laws. The actual constitution of the phenomenal universe
determines the character of our evidence; but it cannot determine
what conclusions given evidence rationally supports.
CHAPTER XIX
the nature of argument by analogy
All kinds of reasoning from causes or effects are founded on two particulars,
viz. the constant conjunction of any two objects in all past experience,
and the resemblance of a present object to any of them. Without some
degree of resemblance, as well as union, ’tis impossible there can be any
reasoning.—Hume.
*
1. Hume rightly maintains that some degree of resemblance must
always exist between the various instances upon which a generalisation
is based. For they must have this, at least, in common, that they are
instances of the proposition which generalises them. Some element of
analogy must, therefore, lie at the base of every inductive argument.
In this chapter I shall try to explain with precision the meaning of
Analogy, and to analyse the reasons, for which, rightly or wrongly,
we usually regard analogies as strong or weak, without considering at
present whether it is possible to find a good reason for our instinctive
principle that likeness breeds the expectation of likeness.
2. There are a few technical terms to be defined. We mean
by a generalisation a statement that all of a certain definable class
of propositions are true. It is convenient to specify this class in the
following way. If f(x) is true for all those values of x for which f(x) is
true, then we have a generalisation about f and f which we may
write g(f, f). If, for example, we are dealing with the generalisation,
“all swans are white,” this is equivalent to the statement “ ‘x is white’
is true for all those values of x for which ‘x is a swan’ is true.” The
proposition f(a)  f(a) is an instance of the generalisation g(f, f).
By thus defining a generalisation in terms of propositional
functions, it becomes possible to deal with all kinds of generalisations
in a uniform way; and also to bring generalisation into convenient
*A Treatise of Human Nature.
256
ch. xix INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 257
connection with our definition of Analogy.
If some one thing is true about both of two objects, if, that is
to say, they both satisfy the same propositional function, then to
this extent there is an analogy between them. Every generalisation
g(f, f), therefore, asserts that one analogy is always accompanied by
another, namely, that between all objects having the analogy f there
is also the analogy f. The set of propositional functions, which are
satisfied by both of the two objects, constitute the positive analogy.
The analogies, which would be disclosed by complete knowledge, may
be termed the total positive analogy; those which are relative to
partial knowledge, the known positive analogy.
As the positive analogy measures the resemblances, so the negative
analogy measures the differences between the two objects. The set of
functions, such that each is satisfied by one and not by the other of
the objects, constitutes the negative analogy. We have, as before, the
distinction between the total negative analogy and the known negative
analogy.
This set of definitions is soon extended to the cases in which
the number of instances exceeds two. The functions which are true
of all of the instances constitute the positive analogy of the set of
instances, and those which are true of some only, and are false of
others, constitute the negative analogy. It is clear that a function,
which represents positive analogy for a group of instances taken out of
the set, may be a negative analogy for the set as a whole. Analogies
of this kind, which are positive for a sub-class of the instances, but
negative for the whole class, we may term sub-analogies. By this it is
meant that there are resemblances which are common to some of the
instances, but not to all.
A simple notation, in accordance with these definitions, will be
useful. If there is a positive analogy f between a set of instances
a1, . . . an, whether or not this is the total analogy between them, let
us write this—
A
a1...an
(f).
*
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 258
And if there is a negative analogy f
0
, let us write this—
A¯
a1...an
(f
0
).
*
Thus A
a1...an
(f) expresses the fact that there is a set of characteristics
f which are common to all the instances, and A¯
a1...an
(f
0
) that
there is a set of characteristics f
0 which is true of at least one of the
instances and false of at least one.
3. In the typical argument from analogy we wish to generalise
from one part to another of the total analogy which experience
has shown to exist between certain selected instances. In all the
cases where one characteristic f has been found to exist, another
characteristic f has been found to be associated with it. We argue
from this that any instance, which is known to share the first
analogy f, is likely to share also the second analogy f. We have
found in certain cases, that is to say, that both f and f are true of
them; and we wish to assert f as true of other cases in which we
have only observed f. We seek to establish the generalisation g(f, f),
on the ground that f and f constitute between them an observed
positive analogy in a given set of experiences.
But while the argument is of this character, the grounds, upon
which we attribute more or less weight to it, are often rather complex;
and we must discuss them, therefore, in a systematic manner.
4. According to the view suggested in the last chapter, the
value of such an argument depends partly upon the nature of the
conclusion which we seek to draw, partly upon the evidence which
supports it. If Hume had expected the same degree of nourishment
*Hence A

(f) = f(a1)  f(a2). . . f(an) =

ch. xix INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 259
as well as the same taste and relish from all of the eggs, he would
have drawn a conclusion of weaker probability. Let us consider,
then, this dependence of the probability upon the scope of the
generalisation g(f, f),—upon the comprehensiveness, that is to say, of
the condition f and the conclusion f respectively.
The more comprehensive the condition f and the less comprehensive
the conclusion f, the greater à priori probability do we attribute
to the generalisation g. With every increase in f this probability
increases, and with every increase in f it will diminish.
The condition f(= f1f2) is more comprehensive than the condition
f1, relative to the general evidence h, if f2 is a condition
independent of f1 relative to h, f2 being independent of f1, if
g(f1, f2)/h =| 1, i.e. if, relative to h, the satisfaction of f2 is not
inferrible from that of f1.
Similarly the conclusion f(= f1f2) is more comprehensive than the
conclusion f1, relative to the general evidence h, if f2 is a conclusion
independent of f1, relative to h, i.e. if g(f1, f2)/h =| 1.
If f = f1f2 and f = f1f2, where f1 and f2 are independent and
f1 and f2 are independent relative to h, we have—
g(f1, f)/h = g(f1f2, f)  g(f1f¯
2, f)/h
0 g(f, f)/h,
and g(f, f)/h = g(f, f1f2)/h
= g(ff1, f2)/h  g(f, f1)/h
= g(f, f1)/h,
so that g(f, f1)/h = g(f, f)/h = g(f1, f)/h.
This proves the statement made above. It will be noticed that
we cannot necessarily compare the à priori probabilities of two
generalisations in respect of more and less, unless the condition of the
first is included in the condition of the second, and the conclusion of
the second is included in that of the first.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 260
We see, therefore, that some generalisations stand initially in a
stronger position than others. In order to attain a given degree of
probability, generalisations require, according to their scope, different
amounts of favourable evidence to support them.
5. Let us now pass from the character of the generalisation
à priori to the evidence by which we support it. Since, whenever
the conclusion f is complex, i.e. resolvable into the form f1f2 where
g(f1, f2)/h =| 1, we can express the probability of the generalisation
g(f, f) as the product of the probabilities of the two generalisations
g(ff1, f2) and g(f, f), we may assume in what follows, that the
conclusion f is simple and not capable of further analysis, without
diminishing the generality of our argument.
We will begin with the simplest case, namely, that which arises
in the following conditions. First, let us assume that our knowledge
of the examined instances is complete, so that we know of every
statement, which is about the examined instances, whether it is true
or false of each.* Second, let us assume that all the instances which
are known to satisfy the condition f, are also known to satisfy the
conclusion f of the generalisation. And third let us assume that there
is nothing which is true of all the examined instances and yet not
included either in f or in f, i.e. that the positive analogy between the
instances is exactly coextensive with the analogy ff which is covered
by the generalisation.
Such evidence as this constitutes what we may term a perfect
analogy. The argument in favour of the generalisation cannot be
further improved by a knowledge of additional instances. Since the
positive analogy between the instances is exactly coextensive with the
analogy covered by the generalisation, and since our knowledge of the
examined instances is complete, there is no need to take account of
the negative analogy.
An analogy of this kind, however, is not likely to have much
*
If ?(a) is a proposition and ?(a) = h  ?(a), where h is a proposition not
involving a, then we must regard ?(a), not ?(a), as the statement about a.
ch. xix INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 261
practical utility; for if the analogy covered by the generalisation,
covers the whole of the positive analogy between the instances it
is difficult to see to what other instances the generalisation can be
applicable. Any instance, about which everything is true which is
true of all of a set of instances, must be identical with one of them.
Indeed, an argument from perfect analogy can only have practical
utility, if, as will be argued later on, there are some distinctions
between instances which are irrelevant for the purposes of analogy,
and if, in a perfect analogy, the positive analogy, of which we must
take account, need cover only those distinctions which are relevant.
In this case a generalisation based on perfect analogy might cover
instances numerically distinct from those of the original set.
The law of the Uniformity of Nature appears to me to amount
to an assertion that an analogy which is perfect, except that mere
differences of position in time and space are treated as irrelevant,
is a valid basis for a generalisation, two total causes being regarded
as the same if they only differ in their positions in time or space.
This, I think, is the whole of the importance which this law has
for the theory of inductive argument. It involves the assertion of a
generalised judgment of irrelevance, namely, of the irrelevance of mere
position in time and space to generalisations which have no reference
to particular positions in time and space. It is in respect of such
position in time or space that ‘nature’ is supposed ‘uniform.’ The
significance of the law and the nature of its justification, if any, are
further discussed in Chapter XXII.
6. Let us now pass to the type which is next in order of
simplicity. We will relax the first condition and no longer assume that
the whole of the positive analogy between the instances is covered
by the generalisation, though retaining the assumption that our
knowledge of the examined instances is complete. We know, that is
to say, that there are some respects in which the examined instances
are all alike, and yet which are not covered by the generalisation. If
f1 is the part of the positive analogy between the instances which is
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 262
not covered by the generalisation, then the probability of this type of
argument from analogy can be written—
g(f, f)
.
A
a1...an
(ff1f).
The value of this probability turns on the comprehensiveness of f1.
There are some characteristics f1 common to all the instances, which
the generalisation treats as unessential, but the less comprehensive
these are the better. f1 stands for the characteristics in which
all the instances resemble one another outside those covered by the
generalisation. To reduce these resemblances between the instances
is the same thing as to increase the differences between them. And
hence any increase in the Negative Analogy involves a reduction in
the comprehensiveness of f1. When, however, our knowledge of the
instances is complete, it is not necessary to make separate mention of
the negative analogy A¯
a1...an
(f
0
) in the above formula. For f
0
simply
includes all those functions about the instances, which are not
included in ff1f, and of which the contradictories are not included in
them; so that in stating A
a1...an
(ff1f), we state by implication A¯
a1...an
(f
0
)
also.
The whole process of strengthening the argument in favour of
the generalisation g(f, f) by the accumulation of further experience
appears to me to consist in making the argument approximate as
nearly as possible to the conditions of a perfect analogy, by steadily
reducing the comprehensiveness of those resemblances f1 between the
instances which our generalisation disregards. Thus the advantage of
additional instances, derived from experience, arises not out of their
number as such, but out of their tendency to limit and reduce the

, since f1f

comprise between them
whatever is not covered by ff. The more numerous the instances,
the less comprehensive are their superfluous resemblances likely to
be. But a single additional instance which greatly reduced f1 would
ch. xix INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 263
increase the probability of the argument more than a large number of
instances which affected f1 less.
7. The nature of the argument examined so far is, then, that
the instances all have some characteristics in common which we have
ignored in framing our generalisation; but it is still assumed that
our knowledge about the examined instances is complete. We will
next dispense with this latter assumption, and deal with the case in
which our knowledge of the characteristics of the examined instances
themselves is or may be incomplete.
It is now necessary to take explicit account of the known negative
analogy. For when the known positive analogy falls short of the total
positive analogy, it is not possible to infer the negative analogy from
it. Differences may be known between the instances which cannot
be inferred from the known positive analogy. The probability of the
argument must, therefore, be written—
g(f, f)
.
A
a1...an
(ff1f) A¯
a1...an
(f
0
),
where ff1f stands for the characteristics in which all n instances
a1 . . . an are known to be alike, and f
0
stands for the characteristics
in which they are known to differ.
This argument is strengthened by any additional instance or by any
additional knowledge about the former instances which diminishes
the known superfluous resemblances f1 or increases the negative
analogy f
0
. The object of the accumulation of further experience is
still the same as before, namely, to make the form of the argument
approximate more and more closely to that of perfect analogy. Now,
however, that our knowledge of the instances is no longer assumed
to be complete, we must take account of the mere number n of the
instances, as well as of our specific knowledge in regard to them; for
the more numerous the instances are, the greater the opportunity
for the total negative analogy to exceed the known negative analogy.
But the more complete our knowledge of the instances, the less
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 264
attention need we pay to their mere number, and the more imperfect
our knowledge the greater the stress which must be laid upon the
argument from number. This part of the argument will be discussed
in detail in the following chapter on Pure Induction.
8. When our knowledge of the instances is incomplete, there may
exist analogies which are known to be true of some of the instances
and are not known to be false of any. These sub-analogies (see § 2) are
not so dangerous as the positive analogies f1, which are known to be
true of all the instances, but their existence is, evidently, an element
of weakness, which we must endeavour to eliminate by the growth of
knowledge and the multiplication of instances. A sub-analogy of this
kind between the instances ar . . . as may be written A
ar...as
(?k); and the
formula, if it is to take account of all the relevant information, ought,
therefore, to be written—

between sub-classes of the instances, which are not included in ff1f
or in f

.
9. There is now another complexity to be introduced. We
must dispense with the assumption that the whole of the analogy
covered by the generalisation is known to exist in all the instances.
For there may be some instances within our experience, about which
our knowledge is incomplete, but which show part of the analogy
required by the generalisation and nothing which contradicts it; and
such instances afford some support to the generalisation. Suppose
that bf and bf are part of f and f respectively, then we may have a
set of instances b1 . . . bm which show the following analogies:

b1...bm

as before.
The formula, therefore, is now as follows:

In this expression
Q af, af are the whole or part of f, f; the product

is composed of the positive and negative analogies for each of the
sets of instances a1 . . . an, b1 . . . bm, etc.; and the product Q
contains
the various sub-analogies of different sub-classes of all the instances
a1 . . . an, b1 . . . bm, etc., regarded as one set.*
10. This completes our classification of the positive evidence
which supports a generalisation; but the probability may also be
affected by a consideration of the negative evidence. We have taken
account so far of that part of the evidence only which shows the
whole or part of the analogy we require, and we have neglected those
instances of which f, the condition of the generalisation, or f, its
conclusion, or part of f or of f is known to be false. Suppose that
there are instances of which f is true and f false, it is clear that the
generalisation is ruined. But cases in which we know part of f to
be true and f to be false, and are ignorant as to the truth or falsity
of the rest of f, weaken it to some extent. We must take account,
therefore, of analogies

where a

unknown. The negative evidence, however, can strengthen as well as

weaken the evidence. We deem instances favourably relevant in which
f and f are both false together.*
Our final formula, therefore, must include terms, similar to those
in the formula which concludes § 9, not only for sets of instances
which show analogies af af where af and af are parts of f and f,
but also for sets which show analogies af¯
af, or analogies af¯
a
¯f, where
af and af are the whole or part of f and f, and f¯,
¯f are the
contradictories of f and f.
†
It should be added, perhaps, that the theoretical classification of
most empirical arguments in daily use is complicated by the account
which we reasonably take of generalisations previously established. We
often take account indirectly, therefore, of evidence which supports in
some degree other generalisations than that which we are concerned
to establish or refute at the moment, but the probability of which is
relevant to the problem under investigation.
11. The argument will be rendered unnecessarily complex,
without much benefit to its theoretical interest, if we deal with the
most general case of all. What follows, therefore, will deal with the
formula of the third degree of generality, namely—
g(f, f)

,
in which no partial instances occur, i.e. no instances in which part
only of the analogy, required by the generalisation, is known to exist.
In this third degree of generality, it will be remembered, our knowledge
of the characteristics of the instances is incomplete, there is more
analogy between the instances than is covered by the generalisation,
and there are some sub-analogies to be reckoned with. In the above
*
I am disposed to think that we need not pay attention to instances for
which part of f is known to be false, and part of f to be true. But the
question is a little perplexing.
†Where the conclusion f is simple and not complex (see § 5), some of these
complications cannot, of course, arise.
ch. xix INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 267
formula the incompleteness of our knowledge is implicitly recognised
in that ff1ff0 are not between them entirely comprehensive. It is also
supposed that all the evidence we have is positive, no knowledge is
assumed, that is to say, of instances characterised by the conjunctions
af¯
af, af a
¯f, or af¯
a
¯f, where af and af are part of f and f.
An argument, therefore, from experience, in which, on the basis of
examined instances, we establish a generalisation applicable beyond
these instances, can be strengthened, if we restrict our attention to
the simpler type of case, by the following means:
(1) By reducing the resemblances f1 known to be common to all
the instances, but ignored as unessential by the generalisation.
(2) By increasing the differences f
0 known to exist between the
instances.
(3) By diminishing the sub-analogies or unessential resemblances ?k
known to be common to some of the instances and not known to be
false of any.
These results can generally be obtained in two ways, either by
increasing the number of our instances or by increasing our knowledge
of those we have.
The reasons why these methods seem to common sense to
strengthen the argument are fairly obvious. The object of (1) is to
avoid the possibility that f1 as well as f is a necessary condition of f.
The object of (2) is to avoid the possibility that there may be some
resemblances additional to f, common to all the instances, which have
escaped our notice. The object of (3) is to get rid of indications that
the total value of f1 may be greater than the known value. When
ff1f is the total positive analogy between the instances, so that the
known value of f1 is its total value, it is (1) which is fundamental;
and we need take account of (2) and (3) only when our knowledge of
the instances is incomplete. But when our knowledge of the instances
is incomplete, so that f1 falls short of its total value and we cannot
infer f
0
from it, it is better to regard (2) as fundamental; in any case
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 268
every reduction of f1 must increase f

.
12. I have now attempted to analyse the various ways in which
common practice seems to assume that considerations of Analogy can
yield us presumptive evidence in favour of a generalisation.
It has been my object, in making a classification of empirical
arguments, not so much to put my results in forms closely similar
to those in which problems of generalisation commonly present
themselves to scientific investigators, as to inquire whether ultimate
uniformities of method can be found beneath the innumerable modes,
superficially differing from another, in which we do in fact argue.
I have not yet attempted to justify this way of arguing. After
turning aside to discuss in more detail the method of Pure Induction,
I shall make this attempt; or rather I shall try to see what sort of
assumptions are capable of justifying empirical reasoning of this kind.
CHAPTER XX
the value of multiplication of instances, or pure
induction
1. It has often been thought that the essence of inductive
argument lies in the multiplication of instances. “Where is that
process of reasoning,” Hume inquired, “which from one instance draws
a conclusion, so different from that which it infers from a hundred
instances, that are no way different from that single instance?”
I repeat that by emphasising the number of the instances Hume
obscured the real object of the method. If it were strictly true that
the hundred instances are no way different from the single instance,
Hume would be right to wonder in what manner they can strengthen
the argument. The object of increasing the number of instances arises
out of the fact that we are nearly always aware of some difference
between the instances, and that even where the known difference
is insignificant we may suspect, especially when our knowledge of
the instances is very incomplete, that there may be more. Every
new instance may diminish the unessential resemblances between the
instances and by introducing a new difference increase the Negative
Analogy. For this reason, and for this reason only, new instances are
valuable.
If our premisses comprise the body of memory and tradition which
has been originally derived from direct experience, and the conclusion
which we seek to establish is the Newtonian theory of the Solar
System, our argument is one of Pure Induction, in so far as we
support the Newtonian theory by pointing to the great number of
consequences which it has in common with the facts of experience.
The predictions of the Nautical Almanack are a consequence of the
Newtonian theory, and these predictions are verified many thousand
times a day. But even here the force of the argument largely depends,
not on the mere number of these predictions, but on the knowledge
269
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 270
that the circumstances in which they are fulfilled differ widely from
one another in a vast number of important respects. The variety of
the circumstances, in which the Newtonian generalisation is fulfilled,
rather than the number of them, is what seems to impress our
reasonable faculties.
2. I hold, then, that our object is always to increase the
Negative Analogy, or, which is the same thing, to diminish the
characteristics common to all the examined instances and yet not
taken account of by our generalisation. Our method, however,
maybe one which certainly achieves this object, or it may be
one which possibly achieves it. The former of these, which is
obviously the more satisfactory, may consist either in increasing our
definite knowledge respecting instances examined already, or in finding
additional instances respecting which definite knowledge is obtainable.
The second of them consists in finding additional instances of the
generalisation, about which, however, our definite knowledge may be
meagre; such further instances, if our knowledge about them were
more complete, would either increase or leave unchanged the Negative
Analogy; in the former case they would strengthen the argument and
in the latter case they would not weaken it; and they must, therefore,
be allowed some weight. The two methods are not entirely distinct,
because new instances, about which we have some knowledge but not
much, may be known to increase the Negative Analogy a little by the
first method, and suspected of increasing it further by the second.
It is characteristic of advanced scientific method to depend on the
former, and of the crude unregulated induction of ordinary experience
to depend on the latter. It is when our definite knowledge about
the instances is limited, that we must pay attention to their number
rather than to the specific differences between them, and must fall
back on what I term Pure Induction.
In this chapter I investigate the conditions and the manner in
which the mere repetition of instances can add to the force of the
argument. The chief value of the chapter, in my judgment, is
ch. xx INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 271
negative, and consists in showing that a line of advance, which might
have seemed promising, turns out to be a blind alley, and that we are
thrown back on known Analogy. Pure Induction will not give us any
very substantial assistance in getting to the bottom of the general
inductive problem.
3. The problem of generalisation* by Pure Induction can be
stated in the following symbolic form:
Let h represent the general à priori data of the investigation;
let g represent the generalisation which we seek to establish; let
x1x2 . . . xn represent instances of g.
Then x1/gh = 1, x2/gh = 1 . . . xn/gh = 1; given g, that is to
say, the truth of each of its instances follows. The problem is to
determine the probability g/hx1x2 . . . xn, i.e. the probability of the
generalisation when n instances of it are given. Our analysis will be
simplified, and nothing of fundamental importance will be lost, if we
introduce the assumption that there is nothing in our à priori data
which leads us to distinguish between the à priori likelihood of the
different instances; we assume, that is to say, that there is no reason
à priori for expecting the occurrence of any one instance with greater
reliance than any other, i.e.
x1/h = x2/h = . . . = xn/h.
Write g/hx1x2 . . . xn = pn
and xn+1/hx1x2 . . . xn = yn+1;
*
In the most general sense we can regard any proposition as the generalisation
of all the propositions which follow from it. For if h is any proposition, and we
put f(x) = ‘x can be inferred from h’ and, f(x) = x, then g(f, f) = h. Since
Pure Induction consists in finding as many instances of a generalisation as
possible, it is, in the widest sense, the process of strengthening the probability
of any proposition by adducing numerous instances of known truths which
follow from it. The argument is one of Pure Induction, therefore, in so far
as the probability of a conclusion is based upon the number of independent
consequences which the conclusion and the premisses have in common.

It follows, therefore, that pn > pn-1 so long as yn > 1.

This approaches unity as a limit, if x1x2 . . . xn/gh¯ 

zero as a limit, when n increases.
4. We may now stop to consider how much this argument
has proved. We have shown that if each of the instances necessarily
follows from the generalisation, then each additional instance increases
the probability of the generalisation, so long as the new instance
ch. xx INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 273
could not have been predicted with certainty from a knowledge of the
former instances.* This condition is the same as that which came
to light when we were discussing Analogy. If the new instance were
identical with one of the former instances, a knowledge of the latter
would enable us to predict it. If it differs or may differ in analogy,
then the condition required above is satisfied.
The common notion, that each successive verification of a doubtful
principle strengthens it, is formally proved, therefore, without any
appeal to conceptions of law or of causality. But we have not
proved that this probability approaches certainty as a limit, or even
that our conclusion becomes more likely than not, as the number of
verifications or instances is indefinitely increased.
5. What are the conditions which must be satisfied in order that
the rate, at which the probability of the generalisation increases, may
be such that it will approach certainty as a limit when the number of
independent instances of it are indefinitely increased? We have already
shown, as a basis for this investigation, that pn approaches the limit
of certainty for a generalisation g, if, as n increases, x1x2 . . . xn/gh¯
becomes small compared with p0, i.e. if the à priori probability of so
many instances, assuming the falsehood of the generalisation, is small
compared with the generalisation’s à priori probability. It follows,
therefore, that the probability of an induction tends towards certainty
as a limit, when the number of instances is increased, provided that
xr/x1x2 . . . xr-1gh < ¯ 1 - 
for all values of r, and p0 > ?, where  and ? are finite probabilities,
separated, that is to say, from impossibility by a value of some finite
amount, however small. These conditions appear simple, but the
meaning of a ‘finite probability’ requires a word of explanation.†
*Since pn > pn-1 so long as yn =| 1.
†The proof of these conditions, which is obvious, is as follows:
x1x2 . . . xn/gh¯ = xn-1gh¯  x1x2 . . . xn-1/gh < ¯ (1 - )
n
,
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 274
I argued in Chapter III. that not all probabilities have an exact
numerical value, and that, in the case of some, one can say no
more about their relation to certainty and impossibility than that
they fall short of the former and exceed the latter. There is one
class of probabilities, however, which I called the numerical class,
the ratio of each of whose members to certainty can be expressed
by some number less than unity; and we can sometimes compare a
non-numerical probability in respect of more and less with one of
these numerical probabilities. This enables us to give a definition of
‘finite probability’ which is capable of application to non-numerical
as well as to numerical probabilities. I define a ‘finite probability’
as one which exceeds some numerical probability, the ratio of which
to certainty can be expressed by a finite number.* The principal
method, in which a probability can be proved finite by a process
of argument, arises either when its conclusion can be shown to
be one of a finite number of alternatives, which are between them
exhaustive or, at any rate, have a finite probability, and to which
the Principle of Indifference is applicable; or (more usually), when its
conclusion is more probable than some hypothesis which satisfies this
first condition.
6. The conditions, which we have now established in order that
the probability of a pure induction may tend towards certainty as
the number of instances is increased, are (1) that xr/x1x2 . . . xr-1gh¯
falls short of certainty by a finite amount for all values of r, and
(2) that p0, the à priori probability of our generalisation, exceeds
impossibility by a finite amount. It is easy to see that we can
where  is finite and p0 > ? where ? is finite. There is always, under these
conditions, some finite value of n such that both (1 - )
n and (1 - )
n
?
are less
than any given finite quantity, however small.
*Hence a series of probabilities p1p2 . . . pr approaches a limit L, if, given any
positive finite number  however small, a positive integer n can always be found
such that for all values of r greater than n the difference between L and pr is
less than   ?, where ? is the measure of certainty.
ch. xx INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 275
show by an exactly similar argument that the following more general
conditions are equally satisfactory:
(1) That xr/x1x2 . . . xr-1gh¯ falls short of certainty by a finite
amount for all values of r beyond a specified value s.
(2) That ps, the probability of the generalisation relative to a
knowledge of these first s instances, exceeds impossibility by a finite
amount.
In other words Pure Induction can be usefully employed to
strengthen an argument if, after a certain number of instances have
been examined, we have, from some other source, a finite probability
in favour of the generalisation, and, assuming the generalisation is
false, a finite uncertainty as to its conclusion being satisfied by the
next hitherto unexamined instance which satisfies its premiss. To take
an example, Pure Induction can be used to support the generalisation
that the sun will rise every morning for the next million years,
provided that with the experience we have actually had there are
finite probabilities, however small, derived from some other source,
first, in favour of the generalisation, and, second, in favour of the
sun’s not rising to-morrow assuming the generalisation to be false.
Given these finite probabilities, obtained otherwise, however small,
then the probability can be strengthened and can tend to increase
towards certainty by the mere multiplication of instances provided
that these instances are so far distinct that they are not inferrible one
from another.
7. Those supposed proofs of the Inductive Principle, which are
based openly or implicitly on an argument in inverse probability, are
all vitiated by unjustifiable assumptions relating to the magnitude of
the à priori probability p0. Jevons, for instance, avowedly assumes
that we may, in the absence of special information, suppose any
unexamined hypothesis to be as likely as not. It is difficult to see
how such a belief, if even its most immediate implications had been
properly apprehended, could have remained plausible to a mind of
so sound a practical judgment as his. The arguments against it and
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 276
the contradictions to which it leads have been dealt with in Chapter
IV. The demonstration of Laplace, which depends upon the Rule of
Succession, will be discussed in Chapter XXX.
8. The prior probability, which must always be found, before
the method of pure induction can be usefully employed to support a
substantial argument, is derived, I think, in most ordinary cases—
with what justification it remains to discuss—from considerations of
Analogy. But the conditions of valid induction as they have been
enunciated above, are quite independent of analogy, and might be
applicable to other types of argument. In certain cases we might
feel justified in assuming directly that the necessary conditions are
satisfied.
Our belief, for instance, in the validity of a logical scheme is
based partly upon inductive grounds—on the number of conclusions,
each seemingly true on its own account, which can be derived from
the axioms—and partly on a degree of self-evidence in the axioms
themselves sufficient to give them the initial probability upon which
induction can build. We depend upon the initial presumption that, if
a proposition appears to us to be true, this is by itself, in the absence
of opposing evidence, some reason for its being as well as appearing
true. We cannot deny that what appears true is sometimes false,
but, unless we can assume some substantial relation of probability
between the appearance and the reality of truth, the possibility of
even probable knowledge is at an end.
The conception of our having some reason, though not a conclusive
one, for certain beliefs, arising out of direct inspection, may prove
important to the theory of epistemology. The old metaphysics has
been greatly hindered by reason of its having always demanded
demonstrative certainty. Much of the cogency of Hume’s criticism
arises out of the assumption of methods of certainty on the part of
those systems against which it was directed. The earlier realists were
hampered by their not perceiving that lesser claims in the beginning
might yield them what they wanted in the end. And transcendental
ch. xx INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 277
philosophy has partly arisen, I believe, through the belief that there
is no knowledge on these matters short of certain knowledge, being
combined with the belief that such certain knowledge of metaphysical
questions is beyond the power of ordinary methods.
When we allow that probable knowledge is, nevertheless, real,
a new method of argument can be introduced into metaphysical
discussions. The demonstrative method can be laid on one side,
and we may attempt to advance the argument by taking account
of circumstances which seem to give some reason for preferring one
alternative to another. Great progress may follow if the nature
and reality of objects of perception,*
for instance, can be usefully
investigated by methods not altogether dissimilar from those employed
in science and with the prospect of obtaining as high a degree of
certainty as that which belongs to some scientific conclusions; and it
may conceivably be shown that a belief in the conclusions of science,
enunciated in any reasonable manner however restricted, involves a
preference for some metaphysical conclusions over others.
9. Apart from analysis, careful reflection would hardly lead us
to expect that a conclusion which is based on no other than grounds
of pure induction, defined as I have defined them as consisting of
repetition of instances merely, could attain in this way to a high
degree of probability. To this extent we ought all of us to agree
with Hume. We have found that the suggestions of common sense
are supported by more precise methods. Moreover, we constantly
distinguish between arguments, which we call inductive, upon other
grounds than the number of instances upon which they are based; and
under certain conditions we regard as crucial an insignificant number
of experiments. The method of pure induction may be a useful means
of strengthening a probability based on some other ground. In the
*A paper by Mr. G. E. Moore entitled, “The Nature and Reality of Objects
of Perception,” which was published in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society
for 1906, seems to me to apply for the first time a method somewhat resembling
that which is described above.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 278
case, however, of most scientific arguments, which would commonly
be called inductive, the probability that we are right, when we
make predictions on the basis of past experience, depends not so
much on the number of past experiences upon which we rely, as on
the degree in which the circumstances of these experiences resemble
the known circumstances in which the prediction is to take effect.
Scientific method, indeed, is mainly devoted to discovering means of
so heightening the known analogy that we may dispense as far as
possible with the methods of pure induction.
When, therefore, our previous knowledge is considerable and the
analogy is good, the purely inductive part of the argument may take
a very subsidiary place. But when our knowledge of the instances is
slight, we may have to depend upon pure induction a good deal. In
an advanced science it is a last resort,—the least satisfactory of the
methods. But sometimes it must be our first resort, the method upon
which we must depend in the dawn of knowledge and in fundamental
inquiries where we must presuppose nothing.
CHAPTER XXI
the nature of inductive argument continued
1. In the enunciation, given in the two preceding chapters,
of the Principles of Analogy and Pure Induction there has been no
reference to experience or causality or law. So far, the argument has
been perfectly formal and might relate to a set of propositions of any
type. But these methods are most commonly employed in physical
arguments where material objects or experiences are the terms of the
generalisation. We must consider, therefore, whether there is any
good ground, as some logicians seem to have supposed, for restricting
them to this kind of inquiry.
I am inclined to think that, whether reasonably or not, we
naturally apply them to all kinds of argument alike, including formal
arguments as, for example, about numbers. When we are told that
Fermat’s formula for a prime, namely, 2
2
a
+ 1 for all values of a,
has been verified in every case in which verification is not excessively
laborious—namely, for a = 1, 2, 3, and 4, we feel that this is
some reason for accepting it, or, at least, that it raises a sufficient
presumption to justify a further examination of the formula.* Yet
there can be no reference here to the uniformity of nature or physical
causation. If inductive methods are limited to natural objects, there
can no more be an appreciable ground for thinking that 2
2
a
+ 1 is
a true formula for primes, because empirical methods show that it
yields primes up to a = 4, or even if they showed that it yielded primes
for every number up to a million million, than there is to think that
any formula which I may choose to write down at random is a true
source of primes. To maintain that there is no appreciable ground in
such a case is paradoxical. If, on the other hand, a partial verification
*This formula has, in fact, been disproved in recent times, e.g. 2
2
5
+ 1 =
4, 294, 967, 297 = 641 × 6, 700, 417. Thus it is no longer so good an illustration
as it would have been a hundred years ago.
279
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 280
does raise some just appreciable presumption in the formula’s favour,
then we must include numbers, at any rate, as well as material objects
amongst the proper subjects of the inductive method. The conclusion
of the previous chapter indicates, however, that, if arguments of this
kind have force, it can only be in virtue of there being some finite
à priori probability for the formula based on other than inductive
grounds.
There are some illustrations in Jevons’s Principles of Science,
*
which are relevant to this discussion. We find it to be true of the
following six numbers:
5, 15, 35, 45, 65, 95
that they all end in five, and are all divisible by five without
remainder. Would this fact, by itself, raise any kind of presumption
that all numbers ending in five are divisible by five without remainder?
Let us also consider the six numbers,
7, 17, 37, 47, 67, 97.
They all end in seven and also agree in being primes. Would this
raise a presumption in favour of the generalisation that all numbers
are prime, which end in seven? We might be prejudiced in favour of
the first argument, because it would lead us to a true conclusion; but
we ought not to be prejudiced against the second because it would
lead us to a false one; for the validity of empirical arguments as the
foundation of a probability cannot be affected by the actual truth or
falsity of their conclusions. If, on the evidence, the analogy is similar
and equal, and if the scope of the generalisation and its conclusion is
similar, then the value of the two arguments must be equal also.
Whether or not the use of empirical argument appears plausible
to us in these particular examples, it is certainly true that
*Pp. 229–231 (one volume edition). Jevons uses these illustrations, not for
the purpose to which I am here putting them, but to demonstrate the fallibility
of empirical laws.
ch. xxi INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 281
many mathematical theorems have actually been discovered by such
methods. Generalisations have been suggested nearly as often,
perhaps, in the logical and mathematical sciences, as in the physical,
by the recognition of particular instances, even where formal proof
has been forthcoming subsequently. Yet if the suggestions of analogy
have no appreciable probability in the formal sciences, and should be
permitted only in the material, it must be unreasonable for us to
pursue them. If no finite probability exists that a formula, for which
we have empirical verification, is in fact universally true, Newton was
acting fortunately, but not reasonably, when he hit on the Binomial
Theorem by methods of empiricism.*
2. I am inclined to believe, therefore, that, if we trust the
promptings of common sense, we have the same kind of ground for
trusting analogy in mathematics that we have in physics, and that
we ought to be able to apply any justification of the method, which
suits the latter case, to the former also. This does not mean that
the à priori probabilities, from some other source than induction,
which the inductive method requires as its foundation, may not be
sought and found differently in the two types of inquiry. A reason
why it has been thought that analogy ought to be confined to natural
laws may be, perhaps, that in most of those cases, in which we
could support a mathematical theorem by a very strong analogy, the
existence of a formal proof has done away with the necessity for the
limping methods of empiricism; and because in most mathematical
investigations, while in our earliest thoughts we are not ashamed
to consult analogy, our later work will be more profitably spent in
searching for a formal proof than in establishing analogies which must,
at the best, be relatively weak. As the modern scientist discards, as a
rule, the method of pure induction, in favour of experimental analogy,
where, if he takes account of his previous knowledge, one or two
cases may prove immensely significant; so the modern mathematician
*See Jevons, loc. cit. p. 231.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 282
prefers the resources of his analysis, which may yield him certainty,
to the doubtful promises of empiricism.
3. The main reason, however, why it has often been held that
we ought to limit inductive methods to the content of the particular
material universe in which we live, is, most probably, the fact that
we can easily imagine a universe so constructed that such methods
would be useless. This suggests that analogy and induction, while
they happen to be useful to us in this world, cannot be universal
principles of logic, on the same footing, for instance, as the syllogism.
In one sense this opinion may be well founded. I do not deny
or affirm at present that it may be necessary to confine inductive
methods to arguments about certain kinds of objects or certain
kinds of experiences. It may be true that in every useful argument
from analogy our premisses must contain fundamental assumptions,
obtained directly and not inductively, which some possible experiences
might preclude. Moreover, the success of induction in the past can
certainly affect its probable usefulness for the future. We may discover
something about the nature of the universe—we may even discover it
by means of induction itself—the knowledge of which has the effect of
destroying the further utility of induction. I shall argue later on that
the confidence with which we ourselves use the method does in fact
depend upon the nature of our past experience.
But this empirical attitude towards induction may, on the other
hand, arise out of either one of two possible confusions. It may
confuse, first, the reasonable character of arguments with their
practical usefulness. The usefulness of induction depends, no doubt,
upon the actual content of experience. If there were no repetition of
detail in the universe, induction would have no utility. If there were
only a single object in the universe, the laws of addition would have
no utility. But the processes of induction and addition would remain
reasonable. It may confuse, secondly, the validity of attributing
probability to the conclusion of an argument with the question of the
actual truth of the conclusion. Induction tells us that, on the basis
ch. xxi INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 283
of certain evidence, a certain conclusion is reasonable, not that it is
true. If the sun does not rise to-morrow, if Queen Anne still lives,
this will not prove that it was foolish or unreasonable of us to have
believed the contrary.
4. It will be worth while to say a little more in this connection
about the not infrequent failure to distinguish the rational from the
true. The excessive ridicule, which this mistake has visited on the
supposed irrationality of barbarous and primitive peoples, affords
some good examples. “Reflection and enquiry should satisfy us,”
says Dr. Frazer in the Golden Bough, “that to our predecessors we
are indebted for much of what we thought most our own, and that
their errors were not wilful extravagances or the ravings of insanity,
but simply hypotheses, justifiable as such at the time when they
were propounded, but which a fuller experience has proved to be
inadequate. . . . Therefore, in reviewing the opinions and practices of
ruder ages and races we shall do well to look with leniency upon
their errors as inevitable slips made in the search for truth. . . .” The
first introduction of iron ploughshares into Poland, he tells in another
passage, having been followed by a succession of bad harvests, the
farmers attributed the badness of the crops to the iron ploughshares,
and discarded them for the old wooden ones. The method of reasoning
of the farmers is not different from that of science, and may, surely,
have had for them some appreciable probability in its favour. “It
is a curious superstition,” says a recent pioneer in Borneo, “this of
the Dusuns, to attribute anything—whether good or bad, lucky or
unlucky—that happens to them to something novel which has arrived
in their country. For instance, my living in Kindram has caused the
intensely hot weather we have experienced of late.” * What is this
curious superstition but the Method of Difference?
The following passage from Jevons’s Principles of Science well
illustrates the tendency, to which he himself yielded, to depreciate
*Golden Bough, p. 174.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 284
the favourite analogies of one age, because the experience of their
successors has confuted them. Between things which are the same
in number, he points out, there is a certain resemblance, namely in
number; and in the infancy of science men could not be persuaded
that there was not a deeper resemblance implied in that of number.
“Seven days are mentioned in Genesis; infants acquire their teeth at
the end of seven months; they change them at the end of seven years;
seven feet was the limit of man’s height; every seventh year was a
climacteric or critical year, at which a change of disposition took
place. In natural science there were not only the seven planets, and
the seven metals, but also the seven primitive colours, and the seven
tones of music. So deep a hold did this doctrine take that we still
have its results in many customs, not only in the seven days of the
week, but the seven years’ apprenticeship, puberty at fourteen years,
the second climacteric, and legal majority at twenty-one years, the
third climacteric.” Religious systems from Pythagoras to Comte have
sought to derive strength from the virtue of seven. “And even in
scientific matters the loftiest intellects have occasionally yielded, as
when Newton was misled by the analogy between the seven tones of
music and the seven colours of his spectrum. . . . Even the genius of
Huyghens did not prevent him from inferring that but one satellite
could belong to Saturn, because, with those of Jupiter and the earth,
it completed the perfect number of six.” But is it certain that Newton
and Huyghens were only reasonable when their theories were true,
and that their mistakes were the fruit of a disordered fancy? Or
that the savages, from whom we have inherited the most fundamental
inductions of our knowledge, were always superstitious when they
believed what we now know to be preposterous?
It is important to understand that the common sense of the race
has been impressed by very weak analogies and has attributed to
them an appreciable probability, and that a logical theory, which is to
justify common sense, need not be afraid of including these marginal
cases. Even our belief in the real existence of other people, which we
ch. xxi INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 285
all hold to be well established, may require for its justification the
combination of experience with a just appreciable à priori possibility
for Animism generally.*
If we actually possess evidence which renders
some conclusion absurd, it is very difficult for us to appreciate
the relation of this conclusion to data which are different and less
complete; but it is essential that we should realise arguments from
analogy as relative to premisses, if we are to approach the logical
theory of Induction without prejudice.
5. While we depreciate the former probability of beliefs which
we no longer hold, we tend, I think, to exaggerate the present degree
of certainty of what we still believe. The preceding paragraph is not
intended to deny that savages often greatly overestimate the value of
their crude inductions, and are to this extent irrational. It is not easy
to distinguish between a belief’s being the most reasonable of those
which it is open to us to believe, and its being more probable than
not. In the same way we, perhaps, put an excessive confidence in
those conclusions—the existence of other people, for instance, the law
of gravity, or to-morrow’s sunrise—of which, in comparison with many
other beliefs, we are very well assured. We may sometimes confuse
the practical certainty, attaching to the class of beliefs upon which it
is rational to act with the utmost confidence, with the more wholly
objective certainty of logic. We might rashly assert, for instance, that
*
“This is animism, or that sense of something in Nature which to the
enlightened or civilised man is not there, and in the civilised man’s child, if it
be admitted that he has it at all, is but a faint survival of a phase of the
primitive mind. And by animism I do not mean the theory of a soul in nature,
but the tendency or impulse or instinct, in which all myth originates, to animate
all things; the projection of ourselves into nature; the sense and apprehension of
an intelligence like our own, but more powerful in all visible things” (Hudson,
Far Away and Long Ago, pp. 224–5). This ‘tendency or impulse or instinct,’
refined by reason and enlarged by experience, may be required, in the shape
of an intuitive à priori probability, if some of those universal conclusions of
common sense, which the most sceptical do not kick away, are to be supported
with rational foundations.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 286
to-morrow’s sunrise is as likely to us as failure, and the special virtue
of the number seven as unlikely, even to Pythagoras, as success, in
an attempt to throw heads a hundred times in succession with an
unbiassed coin.*
6. As it has often been held upon various grounds, with reason or
without, that the validity of Induction and Analogy depends in some
way upon the character of the actual world, logicians have sought
for material laws upon which these methods can be founded. The
Laws of Universal Causation and the Uniformity of Nature, namely,
that all events have some cause and that the same total cause always
produces the same effect, are those which commonly do service. But
these principles merely assert that there are some data from which
events posterior to them in time could be inferred. They do not seem
to yield us much assistance in solving the inductive problem proper,
or in determining how we can infer with probability from partial
data. It has been suggested in Chapter XIX. that the Principle of
the Uniformity of Nature amounts to an assertion that an argument
from perfect analogy (defined as I have defined it) is valid when
applied to events only differing in their positions in time or space.†
It
has also been pointed out that ordinary inductive arguments appear
to be strengthened by any evidence which makes them approximate
more closely in character to a perfect analogy. But this, I think, is
the whole extent to which this principle, even if its truth could be
assumed, would help us. States of the universe, identical in every
particular, may never recur, and, even if identical states were to recur,
we should not know it.
The kind of fundamental assumption about the character of
material laws, on which scientists appear commonly to act, seems to
*Yet if every inhabitant of the world, Grimsehl has calculated, were to toss
a coin every second, day and night, this latter event would only occur once on
the average in every twenty billion years.
†
Is this interpretation of the Principle of the Uniformity of Nature affected
by the Doctrine of Relativity?
ch. xxi INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 287
me to be much less simple than the bare principle of Uniformity. They
appear to assume something much more like what mathematicians
call the principle of the superposition of small effects, or, as I prefer
to call it, in this connection, the atomic character of natural law.
The system of the material universe must consist, if this kind of
assumption is warranted, of bodies which we may term (without
any implication as to their size being conveyed thereby) legal atoms,
such that each of them exercises its own separate, independent, and
invariable effect, a change of the total state being compounded of a
number of separate changes each of which is solely due to a separate
portion of the preceding state. We do not have an invariable relation
between particular bodies, but nevertheless each has on the others
its own separate and invariable effect, which does not change with
changing circumstances, although, of course, the total effect may be
changed to almost any extent if all the other accompanying causes
are different. Each atom can, according to this theory, be treated as a
separate cause and does not enter into different organic combinations
in each of which it is regulated by different laws.
Perhaps it has not always been realised that this atomic uniformity
is in no way implied by the principle of the Uniformity of Nature.
Yet there might well be quite different laws for wholes of different
degrees of complexity, and laws of connection between complexes
which could not be stated in terms of laws connecting individual
parts. In this case natural law would be organic and not, as it is
generally supposed, atomic. If every configuration of the Universe
were subject to a separate and independent law, or if very small
differences between bodies—in their shape or size, for instance,—led
to their obeying quite different laws, prediction would be impossible
and the inductive method useless. Yet nature might still be uniform,
causation sovereign, and laws timeless and absolute.
The scientist wishes, in fact, to assume that the occurrence
of a phenomenon which has appeared as part of a more complex
phenomenon, may be some reason for expecting it to be associated
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 288
on another occasion with part of the same complex. Yet if different
wholes were subject to different laws quâ wholes and not simply
on account of and in proportion to the differences of their parts,
knowledge of a part could not lead, it would seem, even to presumptive
or probable knowledge as to its association with other parts. Given,
on the other hand, a number of legally atomic units and the laws
connecting them, it would be possible to deduce their effects pro tanto
without an exhaustive knowledge of all the coexisting circumstances.
We do habitually assume, I think, that the size of the atomic unit is
for mental events an individual consciousness, and for material events
an object small in relation to our perceptions. These considerations
do not show us a way by which we can justify Induction. But they
help to elucidate the kind of assumptions which we do actually make,
and may serve as an introduction to what follows.
CHAPTER XXII
the justification of these methods
1. The general line of thought to be followed in this chapter
may be indicated, briefly, at the outset.
A system of facts or propositions, as we ordinarily conceive it,
may comprise an indefinite number of members. But the ultimate
constituents or indefinables of the system, which all the members
of it are about, are less in number than these members themselves.
Further, there are certain laws of necessary connection between the
members, by which it is meant (I do not stop to consider whether
more than this is meant) that the truth or falsity of every member
can be inferred from a knowledge of the laws of necessary connection
together with a knowledge of the truth or falsity of some (but not
all) of the members.
The ultimate constituents together with the laws of necessary
connection make up what I shall term the independent variety of
the system. The more numerous the ultimate constituents and the
necessary laws, the greater is the system’s independent variety. It is
not necessary for my present purpose, which is merely to bring before
the reader’s mind the sort of conception which is in mine, that I
should attempt a complete definition of what I mean by a system.
Now it is characteristic of a system, as distinguished from a
collection of heterogeneous and independent facts or propositions,
that the number of its premisses, or, in other words, the amount
of independent variety in it, should be less than the number of its
members. But it is not an obviously essential characteristic of a
system that its premisses or its independent variety should be actually
finite. We must distinguish, therefore, between systems which may
be termed finite and infinite respectively, the terms finite and infinite
referring not to the number of members in the system but to the
amount of independent variety in it.
289
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 290
The purpose of the discussion, which occupies the greater part of
this chapter, is to maintain that, if the premisses of our argument
permit us to assume that the facts or propositions, with which
the argument is concerned, belong to a finite system, then probable
knowledge can be validly obtained by means of an inductive argument.
I now proceed to approach the question from a slightly different
standpoint, the controlling idea, however, being that which is outlined
above.
2. What is our actual course of procedure in an inductive
argument? We have before us, let us suppose, a set of n instances
which have r known qualities, a1a2 . . . ar in common, these r qualities
constituting the known positive analogy. From these qualities three
(say) are picked out, namely, a1, a2, a3 and we inquire with what
probability all objects having these three qualities have also certain
other qualities which we have picked out, namely, ar-1, ar. We wish
to determine, that is to say, whether the qualities ar-1, ar are bound
up with the qualities a1, a2, a3. In thus approaching this question we
seem to suppose that the qualities of an object are bound together
in a limited number of groups, a sub-class of each group being an
infallible symptom of the coexistence of certain other members of it
also.
Three possibilities are open, any of which would prove destructive
to our generalisation. It may be the case (1) that ar-1 or ar is
independent of all the other qualities of the instances—they may not
overlap, that is to say, with any other groups; or (2) that a1a2a3 do
not belong to the same groups as ar-1ar; or (3) that a1a2a3, while
they belong to the same group as ar-1ar, are not sufficient to specify
this group uniquely—they belong, that is to say, to other groups
also which do not include ar-1 and ar. The precautions we take are
directed towards reducing the likelihood, so far as we can, of each of
these possibilities. We distrust the generalisation if the terms typified
by ar-1ar are numerous and comprehensive, because this increases
the likelihood that some at least of them fall under heading (1), and
ch. xxii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 291
also because it increases the likelihood of (3). We trust it if the
terms typified by a1a2a3 are numerous and comprehensive, because
this decreases the likelihood both of (2) and of (3). If we find a new
instance which agrees with the former instances in a1a2a3ar-1ar but
not in a4, we welcome it, because this disposes of the possibility that
it is a4, alone or in combination, that is bound up with ar-1ar. We
desire to increase our knowledge of the properties, lest there be some
positive analogy which is escaping us, and when our knowledge is
incomplete we multiply instances, which we do not know to increase
the negative analogy for certain, in the hope that they may do so.
If we sum up the various methods of Analogy, we find, I think, that
they are all capable of arising out of an underlying assumption, that if
we find two sets of qualities in coexistence there is a finite probability
that they belong to the same group, and a finite probability also
that the first set specifies this group uniquely. Starting from this
assumption, the object of the methods is to increase the finite
probability and make it large. Whether or not anything of this sort is
explicitly present to our minds when we reason scientifically, it seems
clear to me that we do act exactly as we should act, if this were the
assumption from which we set out.
In most cases, of course, the field is greatly simplified from the
first by the use of our pre-existing knowledge. Of the properties
before us we generally have good reason, derived from prior analogies,
for supposing some to belong to the same group and others to belong
to different groups. But this does not affect the theoretical problem
confronting us.
3. What kind of ground could justify us in assuming the
existence of these finite probabilities which we seem to require? If we
are to obtain them, not directly, but by means of argument, we must
somehow base them upon a finite number of exhaustive alternatives.
The following line of argument seems to me to represent, on the
whole, the kind of assumption which is obscurely present to our
minds. We suppose, I think, that the almost innumerable apparent
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 292
properties of any given object all arise out of a finite number of
generator properties, which we may call f1f2f3 . . .. Some arise out
of f1 alone, some out of f1 in conjunction with f2, and so on.
The properties which arise out of f1 alone form one group; those
which arise out of f1f2 in conjunction form another group, and so
on. Since the number of generator properties is finite, the number
of groups also is finite. If a set of apparent properties arise (say)
out of three generator properties f1f2f3, then this set of properties
may he said to specify the group f1f2f3. Since the total number
of apparent properties is assumed to be greater than that of the
generator properties, and since the number of groups is finite, it
follows that, if two sets of apparent properties are taken, there is, in
the absence of evidence to the contrary, a finite probability that the
second set will belong to the group specified by the first set.
There is, however, the possibility of a plurality of generators.
The first set of apparent properties may specify more than one
group,—there is more than one group of generators, that is to say,
which are competent to produce it; and some only of these groups
may contain the second set of properties. Let us, for the moment,
rule out this possibility.
When we argue from an analogy, and the instances have two
groups of characters in common, namely f and f, either f belongs
to the group f or it arises out of generators partly distinct from
those out of which f arises. For the reason already explained there
is a finite probability that f and f belong to the same group. If
this is the case, i.e. if the generalisation g(ff) is valid, then f will
certainly be true of all other cases in which f is true; if this is not
the case, then f will not always be true when f is true. We have,
therefore, the preliminary conditions necessary for the application of
ch. xxii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 293
pure induction. If xr, etc., are the instances,
g/h = p0, where p0 is finite,
xr/gh = 1, etc.,
and xr/x1x2 . . . xr-1gh¯ = 1 - , where  is finite.
And hence, by the argument of Chapter XX., the probability of
a generalisation, based on such evidence as this, is capable, under
suitable conditions, of tending towards certainty as a limit, when the
number of instances is increased.
If f is complex and includes a number of characters which are not
always found together, it must include a number of separate generator
properties and specify a large group; hence the initial probability that
f belongs to this group is relatively large. If, on the other hand,
f is complex, there will be, for the same reasons mutatis mutandis, a
relatively smaller initial probability than otherwise that f belongs to
any other given group.
When the argument is mainly by analogy, we endeavour to obtain
evidence which makes the initial probability p0 relatively high; when
the analogy is weak and the argument depends for its strength
upon pure induction, p0 is small and pm, which is based upon
numerous instances, depends for its magnitude upon their number.
But an argument from induction must always involve some element
of analogy, and, on the other hand, few arguments from analogy
can afford to ignore altogether the strengthening influence of pure
induction.
4. Let us consider the manner in which the methods of analogy
increase the initial likelihood that two characters belong to the same
group. The numerous characters of an object which are known to
us may be represented by a1a2 . . . an. We select two sets of these,
ar and as, and seek to determine whether as always belongs to the
group specified by ar. Our previous knowledge will enable us, in
general, to rule out many of the object’s characters as being irrelevant
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 294
to the groups specified by ar and as, although this will not be possible
in the most fundamental inquiries. We may also know that certain
characters are always associated with ar or with as. But there will be
left a residuum of whose connection with ar or as we are ignorant.
These characters, whose relevance is in doubt, may be represented by
ar+1 . . . as-1. If the analogy is perfect, these characters are eliminated
altogether. Otherwise, the argument is weakened in proportion to the
comprehensiveness of these doubtful characters. For it may be the
case that some of ar+1 . . . as-1 are necessary as well as ar, in order to
specify all the generators which are required to produce as.
5. We may possibly be justified in neglecting certain of the
characters ar+1 . . . as-1 by direct judgments of irrelevance. There are
certain properties of objects which we rule out from the beginning
as wholly or largely independent and irrelevant to all, or to some,
other properties. The principal judgments of this kind, and those
alone about which we seem to feel much confidence, are concerned
with absolute position in time and space, this class of judgments of
irrelevance being summed up, I have suggested, in the Principle of the
Uniformity of Nature. We judge that mere position in time and space
cannot possibly affect, as a determining cause, any other characters;
and this belief appears so strong and certain, although it is hard to
see how it can be based on experience, that the judgment by which
we arrive at it seems perhaps to be direct. A further type of instance
in which some philosophers seem to have trusted direct judgments of
relevance in these matters arises out of the relation between mind
and matter. They have believed that no mental event can possibly be
a necessary condition for the occurrence of a material event.
The Principle of the Uniformity of Nature, as I interpret it,
supplies the answer, if it is correct, to the criticism that the instances,
on which generalisations are based, are all alike in being past, and
that any generalisation, which is applicable to the future, must be
based, for this reason, upon imperfect analogy. We judge directly
that the resemblance between instances, which consists in their being
ch. xxii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 295
past, is in itself irrelevant, and does not supply a valid ground for
impugning a generalisation.
But these judgments of irrelevance are not free from difficulty,
and we must be suspicious of using them. When I say that position
is irrelevant, I do not mean to deny that a generalisation, the
premiss of which specifies position, may be true, and that the same
generalisation without this limitation might be false. But this is
because the generalisation is incompletely stated; it happens that
objects so specified have the required characters, and hence their
position supplies a sufficient criterion. Position may be relevant as
a sufficient condition but never as a necessary condition, and the
inclusion of it can only affect the truth of a generalisation when we
have left out some other essential condition. A generalisation which is
true of one instance must be true of another which only differs from
the former by reason of its position in time or space.
6. Excluding, therefore, the possibility of a plurality of
generators, we can justify the method of perfect analogy, and other
inductive methods in so far as they can be made to approximate to
this, by means of the assumption that the objects in the field, over
which our generalisations extend, do not have an infinite number
of independent qualities; that, in other words, their characteristics,
however numerous, cohere together in groups of invariable connection,
which are finite in number. This does not limit the number of
entities which are only numerically distinct. In the language used
at the beginning of this chapter, the use of inductive methods can
be justified if they are applied to what we have reason to suppose a
finite system.*
7. Let us now take account of a possible plurality of generators.
I mean by this the possibility that a given character can arise in
more than one way, can belong to more than one distinct group, and
can arise out of more than one generator. f might, for instance, be
*Mr. C. D. Broad, in two articles “On the Relation between Induction and
Probability” (Mind, 1918 and 1920), has been following a similar line of thought.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 296
sometimes due to a generator a1, and a1 might invariably produce f.
But we could not generalise from f to f, if f might be due in other
cases to a different generator a2 which would not be competent to
produce f.
If we were dealing with inductive correlation, where we do not
claim universality for our conclusions, it would be sufficient for us
to assume that the number of distinct generators, to which a given
property f can be due, is always finite. To obtain validity for universal
generalisations it seems necessary to make the more comprehensive
and less plausible assumption that a finite probability always exists
that there is not, in any given case, a plurality of causes. With this
assumption we have a valid argument from pure induction on the
same lines, nearly, as before.
8. We have thus two distinct difficulties to deal with, and we
require for the solution of each a separate assumption. The point
may be illustrated by an example in which only one of the difficulties
is present. There are few arguments from analogy of which we are
better assured than the existence of other people. We feel indeed so
well assured of their existence that it has been thought sometimes
that our knowledge of them must be in some way direct. But analogy
does not seem to me unequal to the proof. We have numerous
experiences in our own person of acts which are associated with
states of consciousness, and we infer that similar acts in others are
likely to be associated with similar states of consciousness. But this
argument from analogy is superior in one respect to nearly all other
empirical arguments, and this superiority may possibly explain the
great confidence which we feel in it. We do seem in this case to have
direct knowledge, such as we have in no other case, that our states of
consciousness are, sometimes at least, causally connected with some
of our acts. We do not, as in other cases, merely observe invariable
sequence or coexistence between consciousness and act; and we do
believe it to be vastly improbable in the case of some at least of our
own physical acts that they could have occurred without a mental
ch. xxii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 297
act to support them. Thus, we seem to have a special assurance of
a kind not usually available for believing that there is sometimes a
necessary connection between the conclusion and the condition of the
generalisation; we doubt it only from the possibility of a plurality of
causes.
The objection to this argument on the ground that the analogy is
always imperfect, in that all the observed connections of consciousness
and act are alike in being mine, seems to me to be invalid on the
same ground as that on which I have put on one side objections to
future generalisations, which are based on the fact that the instances
which support them are all alike in being past. If direct judgments
of irrelevance are ever permissible, there seems some ground for
admitting one here.
9. As a logical foundation for Analogy, therefore, we seem
to need some such assumption as that the amount of variety in the
universe is limited in such a way that there is no one object so
complex that its qualities fall into an infinite number of independent
groups (i.e. groups which might exist independently as well as in
conjunction); or rather that none of the objects about which we
generalise are as complex as this; or at least that, though some objects
may be infinitely complex, we sometimes have a finite probability that
an object about which we seek to generalise is not infinitely complex.
To meet a possible plurality of causes some further assumption is
necessary. If we were content with Inductive Correlations and sought
to prove merely that there was a probability in favour of any instance
of the generalisation in question, without inquiring whether there
was a probability in favour of every instance, it would be sufficient
to suppose that, while there may be more than one sufficient cause
of a character, there is not an infinite number of distinct causes
competent to produce it. And this involves no new assumption; for
if the aggregate variety of the system is finite, the possible plurality
of causes must also be finite. If, however, our generalisation is to
be universal, so that it breaks down if there is a single exception
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 298
to it, we must obtain, by some means or other, a finite probability
that the set of characters, which condition the generalisation, are
not the possible effect of more than one distinct set of fundamental
properties. I do not know upon what ground we could establish
a finite probability to this effect. The necessity for this seemingly
arbitrary hypothesis strongly suggests that our conclusions should
be in the form of inductive correlations, rather than of universal
generalisations. Perhaps our generalisations should always run: ‘It is
probable that any given f is f,’ rather than, ‘It is probable that all f
are f.’ Certainly, what we commonly seem to hold with conviction is
the belief that the sun will rise to-morrow, rather than the belief that
the sun will always rise so long as the conditions explicitly known to
us are fulfilled. This will be matter for further discussion in Part V.,
when Inductive Correlation is specifically dealt with.
10. There is a vagueness, it may be noticed, in the number
of instances, which would be required on the above assumptions to
establish a given numerical degree of probability, which corresponds to
the vagueness in the degree of probability which we do actually attach
to inductive conclusions. We assume that the necessary number of
instances is finite, but we do not know what the number is. We
know that the probability of a well-established induction is great, but,
when we are asked to name its degree, we cannot. Common sense
tells us that some inductive arguments are stronger than others, and
that some are very strong. But how much stronger or how strong we
cannot express. The probability of an induction is only numerically
definite when we are able to make definite assumptions about the
number of independent equiprobable influences at work. Otherwise,
it is non-numerical, though bearing relations of greater and less to
numerical probabilities according to the approximate limits within
which our assumption as to the possible number of these causes lies.
11. Up to this point I have supposed, for the sake of simplicity,
that it is necessary to make our assumptions as to the limitation of
independent variety in an absolute form, to assume, that is to say,
ch. xxii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 299
the finiteness of the system, to which the argument is applied, for
certain. But we need not in fact go so far as this.
If our conclusion is C and our empirical evidence is E, then, in
order to justify inductive methods, our premisses must include, in
addition to E, a general hypothesis H such that C/H, the à priori
probability of our conclusion, has a finite value. The effect of E
is to increase the probability of C above its initial à priori value,
C/HE being greater than C/H. But the method of strengthening C/H
by the addition of evidence E is valid quite apart from the particular
content of H. If, therefore, we have another general hypothesis H0
and other evidence E
0
, such that H/H0 has a finite value, we can,
without being guilty of a circular argument, use evidence E
0 by
the same method as before to strengthen the probability H/H0
. If
we call H, namely, the absolute assertion of the finiteness of the
system under consideration, the inductive hypothesis, and the process
of strengthening C/H by the addition E the inductive method, it is
not circular to use the inductive method to strengthen the inductive
hypothesis itself, relative to some more primitive and less far-reaching
assumption. If, therefore, we have any reason (H0
) for attributing
à priori a finite probability to the Inductive Hypothesis (H), then
the actual conformity of experience à posteriori with expectations
based on the assumption of H can be utilised by the inductive
method to attribute an enhanced value to the probability of H. To
this extent, therefore, we can support the Inductive Hypothesis by
experience. In dealing with any particular question we can take the
Inductive Hypothesis, not at its à priori value, but at the value to
which experience in general has raised it. What we require à priori,
therefore, is not the certainty of the Inductive Hypothesis, but a finite
probability in its favour.*
*
I have implicitly assumed in the above argument that if H0
supports H, it
strengthens an argument which H would strengthen. This is not necessarily the
case for the reasons given on pp. 74 and 165. In these passages the necessary
conditions for the above are elucidated. I am, therefore, assuming that in the
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 300
Our assumption, in its most limited form, then, amounts to this,
that we have a finite à priori probability in favour of the Inductive
Hypothesis as to there being some limitation of independent variety
(to express shortly what I have already explained in detail) in the
objects of our generalisation. Our experience might have been such
as to diminish this probability à posteriori. It has, in fact, been such
as to increase it. It is because there has been so much repetition
and uniformity in our experience that we place great confidence in
it. To this extent the popular opinion that Induction depends upon
experience for its validity is justified and does not involve a circular
argument.
12. I think that this assumption is adequate to its purpose
and would justify our ordinary methods of procedure in inductive
argument. It was suggested in the previous chapter that our
theory of Analogy ought to be as applicable to mathematical as
to material generalisations, if it is to justify common sense. The
above assumptions of the limitation of independent variety sufficiently
satisfy this condition. There is nothing in these assumptions which
gives them a peculiar reference to material objects. We believe, in
fact, that all the properties of numbers can be derived from a limited
number of laws, and that the same set of laws governs all numbers.
To apply empirical methods to such things as numbers renders it
necessary, it is true, to make an assumption about the nature of
numbers. But it is the same kind of assumption as we have to make
about material objects, and has just about as much, or as little,
plausibility. There is no new difficulty.
The assumption, also, that the system of Nature is finite is
in accordance with the analysis of the underlying assumption of
scientists, given at the close of the previous chapter. The hypothesis
of atomic uniformity, as I have called it, while not formally equivalent
to the hypothesis of the limitation of independent variety, amounts
case now in question these conditions actually are fulfilled.
ch. xxii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 301
to very much the same thing. If the fundamental laws of connection
changed altogether with variations, for instance, in the shape or size
of bodies, or if the laws governing the behaviour of a complex had
no relation whatever to the laws governing the behaviour of its parts
when belonging to other complexes, there could hardly be a limitation
of independent variety in the sense in which this has been defined.
And, on the other hand, a limitation of independent variety seems
necessarily to carry with it some degree of atomic uniformity. The
underlying conception as to the character of the System of Nature is
in each case the same.
13. We have now reached the last and most difficult stage of the
discussion. The logical part of our inquiry is complete, and it has left
us, as it is its business to leave us, with a question of epistemology.
Such is the premiss or assumption which our logical processes need to
work upon. What right have we to make it? It is no sufficient answer
in philosophy to plead that the assumption is after all a very little
one.
I do not believe that any conclusive or perfectly satisfactory
answer to this question can be given, so long as our knowledge of
the subject of epistemology is in so disordered and undeveloped a
condition as it is in at present. No proper answer has yet been
given to the inquiry—of what sorts of things are we capable of direct
knowledge? The logician, therefore, is in a weak position, when he
leaves his own subject and attempts to solve a particular instance of
this general problem. He needs guidance as to what kind of reason we
could have for such an assumption as the use of inductive argument
appears to require.
On the one hand, the assumption may be absolutely à priori in
the sense that it would be equally applicable to all possible objects.
On the other hand, it may be seen to be applicable to some classes
of objects only. In this Case it can only arise out of some degree
of particular knowledge as to the nature of the objects in question,
and is to this extent dependent on experience. But if it is experience
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 302
which in this sense enables us to know the assumption as true of
certain amongst the objects of experience, it must enable us to know
it in some manner which we may term direct and not as the result of
an inference.
Now an assumption, that all systems of fact are finite (in the
sense in which I have defined this term), cannot, it seems perfectly
plain, be regarded as having absolute, universal validity in the sense
that such an assumption is self-evidently applicable to every kind of
object and to all possible experiences. It is not, therefore, in quite the
same position as a self-evident logical axiom, and does not appeal to
the mind in the same way. The most which can be maintained is that
this assumption is true of some systems of fact, and, further, that
there are some objects about which, as soon as we understand their
nature, the mind is able to apprehend directly that the assumption in
question is true.
In Chapter II. § 7, I wrote: “By some mental process of which
it is difficult to give an account, we are able to pass from direct
acquaintance with things to a knowledge of propositions about the
things of which we have sensations or understand the meaning.”
Knowledge, so obtained, I termed direct knowledge. From a sensation
of yellow and from an understanding of the meaning of ‘yellow’ and
of ‘colour,’ we could, I suggested, have direct knowledge of the fact or
proposition ‘yellow is a colour;’ we might also know that colour cannot
exist without extension, or that two colours cannot be perceived at
the same time in the same place. Other philosophers might use terms
differently and express themselves otherwise; but the substance of
what I was there trying to say is not very disputable. But when we
come to the question as to what kinds of propositions we can come
to know in this manner, we enter upon an unexplored field where no
certain opinion is discoverable.
In the case of logical terms, it seems to be generally agreed that
if we understand their meaning we can know directly propositions
about them which go far beyond a mere expression of this meaning;—
ch. xxii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 303
propositions of the kind which some philosophers have termed
synthetic. In the case of non-logical or empirical entities, it seems
sometimes to be assumed that our direct knowledge must be confined
to what may be regarded as an expression or description of the
meaning or sensation apprehended by us. If this view is correct the
Inductive Hypothesis is not the kind of thing about which we can
have direct knowledge as a result of our acquaintance with objects.
I suggest, however, that this view is incorrect, and that we
are capable of direct knowledge about empirical entities which goes
beyond a mere expression of our understanding or sensation of them.
It may be useful to give the reader two examples, more familiar than
the Inductive Hypothesis, where, as it appears to me, such knowledge
is commonly assumed. The first is that of the causal irrelevance of
mere position in time and space, commonly called the Uniformity of
Nature. We do believe, and yet have no adequate inductive reason
whatever for believing, that mere position in time and space cannot
make any difference. This belief arises directly, I think, out of our
acquaintance with the objects of experience and our understanding of
the concepts of ‘time’ and ‘space.’ The second is that of the Law of
Causation. We believe that every object in time has a ‘necessary’
connection* with some set of objects at a previous time. This belief
also, I think, arises in the same way. It is to be noticed that neither
of these beliefs clearly arises, in spite of the directness which may
be claimed for them, out of any one single experience. In a way
analogous to these, the validity of assuming the Inductive Hypothesis,
as applied to a particular class of objects, appears to me to be
justified.
Our justification for using inductive methods in an argument about
numbers arises out of our perceiving directly, when we understand
the meaning of a number, that they are of the required character.†
*
I do not propose to define the meaning of this.
†Since numbers are logical entities, it may be thought less unorthodox to
make such an assumption in their case.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 304
And when we perceive the nature of our phenomenal experiences,
we have a direct assurance that in their case also the assumption
is legitimate. We are capable, that is to say, of direct synthetic
knowledge about the nature of the objects of our experience. On the
other hand, there may be some kinds of objects, about which we have
no such assurance and to which inductive methods are not reasonably
applicable. It may be the case that some metaphysical questions are
of this character and that those philosophers have been right who
have refused to apply empirical methods to them.
14. I do not pretend that I have given any perfectly adequate
reason for accepting the theory I have expounded, or any such theory.
The Inductive Hypothesis stands in a peculiar position in that it
seems to be neither a self-evident logical axiom nor an object of
direct acquaintance; and yet it is just as difficult, as though the
inductive hypothesis were either of these, to remove from the organon
of thought the inductive method which can only be based on it or on
something like it.
As long as the theory of knowledge is so imperfectly understood
as now, and leaves us so uncertain about the grounds of many of
our firmest convictions, it would be absurd to confess to a special
scepticism about this one. I do not think that the foregoing argument
has disclosed a reason for such scepticism. We need not lay aside the
belief that this conviction gets its invincible certainty from some valid
principle darkly present to our minds, even though it still eludes the
peering eyes of philosophy.
CHAPTER XXIII
some historical notes on induction
1. The number of books, which deal with inductive*
theory, is
extraordinarily small. It is usual to associate the subject with the
names of Bacon, Hume, and Mill. In spite of the modern tendency to
depreciate the first and the last of these, they are the principal names,
I think, with which the history of induction ought to be associated.
The next place is held by Laplace and Jevons. Amongst contemporary
logicians there is an almost complete absence of constructive theory,
and they content themselves for the most part with the easy task of
criticising Mill, or with the more difficult one of following him.
That the inductive theories of Bacon and of Mill are full of errors
and even of absurdities, is, of course, a commonplace of criticism.
But when we ignore details, it becomes clear that they were really
attempting to disentangle the essential issues. We depreciate them
partly, perhaps, as a reaction from the view once held that they
helped the progress of scientific discovery. For it is not plausible to
suppose that Newton owed anything to Bacon, or Darwin to Mill.
But with the logical problem their minds were truly occupied, and in
the history of logical theory they should always be important.
It is true, nevertheless, that the advancement of science was the
main object which Bacon himself, though not Mill, believed that
his philosophy would promote. The Great Instauration was intended
to promulgate an actual method of discovery entirely different from
any which had been previously known.†
It did not do this, and
against such pretensions Macaulay’s well-known essay was not unjustly
directed. Mill, however, expressly disclaimed in his preface any other
*See note at the end of this chapter on “The Use of the Term Induction.”
†He speaks of himself as being “in hac re plane protopirus, et vestigia
nullius sequutus”; and in the Praefatio Generalis he compares his method to the
mariner’s compass, until the discovery of which no wide sea could be crossed
(see Spedding and Ellis, vol. i. p. 24).
305
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 306
object than to classify and generalise the practices “conformed to
by accurate thinkers in their scientific inquiries.” Whereas Bacon
offered rules and demonstrations, hitherto unknown, with which any
man could solve all the problems of science by taking pains, Mill
admitted that “in the existing state of the cultivation of the sciences,
there would be a very strong presumption against any one who
should imagine that he had effected a revolution in the theory of the
investigation of truth, or added any fundamentally new process to the
practice of it.”
2. The theories of both seem to me to have been injured, though
in different degrees, by a failure to keep quite distinct the three
objects: (1) of helping the scientist, (2) of explaining and analysing
his practice, and (3) of justifying it. Bacon was really interested in
the second as well as in the first, and was led to some of his methods
by reflecting upon what distinguished good arguments from bad in
actual investigations. To logicians his methods were as new as he
claimed, but they had their origin, nevertheless, in the commonest
inferences of science and daily life. But his main preoccupation was
with the first, which did injury to his treatment of the third. He
himself became aware as the work progressed that, in his anxiety to
provide an infallible mode of discovery, he had put forth more than
he would ever be able to justify.* His own mind grew doubtful,
and the most critical parts of the description of the new method
were never written. No one who has reflected much upon Induction
need find it difficult to understand the progress and development of
Bacon’s thoughts. To the philosopher who first distinguished some of
the complexities of empirical proof in a generalised, and not merely a
particular, form, the prospects of systematising these methods must
have seemed extraordinarily hopeful. The first investigator could not
*This view is taken in the edition of James Spedding and Leslie Ellis. Their
introductions to Bacon’s philosophical works seem to me to be very greatly
superior to the accounts to be found elsewhere. They make intelligible, what
seems, according to other commentaries, fanciful and without sense or reason.
ch. xxiii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 307
have anticipated that Induction, in spite of its apparent certainty,
would prove so elusive to analysis.
Mill also was led, in a not dissimilar way, to attempt a too simple
treatment, and, in seeking for ease and certainty, to treat far too
lightly the problem of justifying what he had claimed. Mill shirks,
almost openly, the difficulties; and scarcely attempts to disguise from
himself or his readers that he grounds induction upon a circular
argument.
3. Some of the most characteristic errors both of Bacon
and of Mill arise, I think, out of a misapprehension, which it has
been a principal object of this book to correct. Both believed,
without hesitation it seems, that induction is capable of establishing
a conclusion which is absolutely certain, and that an argument is
invalid if the generalisation, which it supports, admits of exceptions
in fact. “Absolute certainty,” says Leslie Ellis,*
“is one of the
distinguishing characters of the Baconian induction.” It was, in
this respect, mainly that it improved upon the older induction
per enumerationem simplicem. “The induction which the logicians
speak of,” Bacon argues in the Advancement of Learning, “is utterly
vicious and incompetent. . . . For to conclude upon an enumeration
of particulars, without instance contradictory, is no conclusion but a
conjecture.” The conclusions of the new method, unlike those of the
old, are not liable to be upset by further experience. In the attempt
to justify these claims and to obtain demonstrative methods, it was
necessary to introduce assumptions for which there was no warrant.
Precisely similar claims were made by Mill, although there are
passages in which he abates them,†
for his own rules of procedure.
An induction has no validity, according to him as according to Bacon,
unless it is absolutely certain. The following passage‡
is significant
of the spirit in which the subject was approached by him: “Let us
*Op. cit. vol. i. p. 23.
†When he deals with Plurality of Causes, for instance.
‡Bk. iii. chap. iii. 3 (the italics are mine).
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 308
compare a few cases of incorrect inductions with others which are
acknowledged to be legitimate. Some, we know, which were believed
for centuries to be correct, were nevertheless incorrect. That all swans
are white, cannot have been a good induction, since the conclusion
has turned out erroneous. The experience, however, on which the
conclusion rested was genuine.” Mill has not justly apprehended the
relativity of all inductive arguments to the evidence, nor the element
of uncertainty which is present, more or less, in all the generalisations
which they support.* Mill’s methods would yield certainty, if they
were correct, just as Bacon’s would. It is the necessity, to which
Mill had subjected himself, of obtaining certainty that occasions their
want of reality. Bacon and Mill both assume that experiment can
shape and analyse the evidence in a manner and to an extent which
is not in fact possible. In the aims and expectations with which
they attempt to solve the inductive problem, there is on fundamental
points an unexpectedly close resemblance between them.
4. Turning from these general criticisms to points of greater
detail, we find that the line of thought pursued by Mill was essentially
the same as that which had been pursued by Bacon, and, also,
that the argument of the preceding chapters is, in spite of some
real differences, a development of the same fundamental ideas which
underlie, as it seems to me, the theories of Mill and Bacon alike.
We have seen that all empirical arguments require an initial
probability derived from analogy, and that this initial probability
may be raised towards certainty by means of pure induction or the
multiplication of instances. In some arguments we depend mainly
upon analogy, and the initial probability obtained by means of it
(with the assistance, as a rule, of previous knowledge) is so large
*This misapprehension may be connected with Mill’s complete failure to
grasp with any kind of thoroughness the nature and importance of the theory
of probability. The treatment of this topic in the System of Logic is exceedingly
bad. His understanding of the subject was, indeed, markedly inferior to the best
thought of his own time.
ch. xxiii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 309
that numerous instances are not required. In other arguments pure
induction predominates. As science advances and the body of preexisting
knowledge is increased, we depend increasingly upon analogy;
and only at the earlier stages of our investigations is it necessary
to rely, for the greater part of our support, upon the multiplication
of instances. Bacon’s great achievement, in the history of logical
theory, lay in his being the first logician to recognise the importance
of methodical analogy to scientific argument and the dependence
upon it of most well-established conclusions. The Novum Organum is
mainly concerned with explaining methodical ways of increasing what
I have termed the Positive and Negative Analogies, and of avoiding
false Analogies. The use of exclusions and rejections, to which Bacon
attached supreme importance, and which he held to constitute the
essential superiority of his method over those which preceded it,
entirely consists in the determination of what characters (or natures
as he would call them) belong to the positive and negative analogies
respectively. The first two tables with which the investigation begins
are, first, the table essentiae et praesentiae, which contains all known
instances in which the given nature is present, and, second, the
table declinationis sive absentiae in proximo, which contains instances
corresponding in each case to those of the first table, but in which,
notwithstanding this correspondence, the given nature is absent.* The
doctrine of prerogative instances is concerned no less plainly with
the methodical determination of Analogy. And the doctrine of idols
is expounded for the avoidance of false analogies, standing, he says,
in the same relation to the interpretation of Nature, as the doctrine
of fallacies to ordinary logic.† Bacon’s error lay in supposing that,
because these methods were new to logic, they were therefore new
to practice. He exaggerated also their precision and their certainty;
and he underestimated the importance of pure induction. But there
was, at bottom, nothing about his rules impracticable or fantastic, or
*Ellis, vol. i. p. 33.
†Ellis, vol. i. p. 89.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 310
indeed unusual.
5. Almost the whole of the preceding paragraph is equally
applicable to Mill. He agreed with Bacon in depreciating the part
played in scientific inquiry by pure induction, and in emphasising
the importance of analogy to all systematic investigators. But he
saw further than Bacon in allowing for the Plurality of Causes, and
in admitting that an element of pure induction was therefore made
necessary. “The Plurality of Causes,” he says,*
“is the only reason
why mere number of instances is of any importance in inductive
inquiry. The tendency of unscientific inquirers is to rely too much
on number, without analysing the instances. . . . Most people hold
their conclusions with a degree of assurance proportioned to the mere
mass of the experience on which they appear to rest; not considering
that by the addition of instances to instances, all of the same kind,
that is, differing from one another only in points already recognised
as immaterial, nothing whatever is added to the evidence of the
conclusion. A single instance eliminating some antecedent which
existed in all the other cases, is of more value than the greatest
multitude of instances which are reckoned by their number alone.”
Mill did not see, however, that our knowledge of the instances is
seldom complete, and that new instances, which are not known to
differ from the former in material respects, may add, nevertheless,
to the negative analogy, and that the multiplication of them may,
for this reason, strengthen the evidence. It is easy to see that his
methods of Agreement and Difference closely resemble Bacon’s, and
aim, like Bacon’s, at the determination of the Positive and Negative
Analogies. By allowing for Plurality of Causes Mill advanced beyond
Bacon. But he was pursuing the same line of thought which alike
led to Bacon’s rules and has been developed in the chapters of this
book. Like Bacon, however, he exaggerated the precision with which
*Book iv. chap. x. 2.
ch. xxiii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 311
his canons of inquiry could be used in practice.
6. No more need be said respecting method and analysis.
But in both writers the exposition of method is closely intermingled
with attempts to justify it. There is nothing in Bacon which at all
corresponds to Mill’s appeals to Causation or to the Uniformity of
Nature, and, when they seek for the ground of induction, there is
much that is peculiar to each writer. It is my purpose, however, to
consider in this place the details common to both, which seem to me
to be important and which exemplify the only line of investigation
which seems likely to be fruitful; and I shall pursue no further,
therefore, their numerous points of difference.
The attempt, which I have made to justify the initial probability
which Analogy seems to supply, primarily depends upon a certain
limitation of independent variety and upon the derivation of all the
properties of any given object from a limited number of primary
characters. In the same way I have supposed that the number of
primary characters which are capable of producing a given property
is also limited. And I have argued that it is not easy to see how a
finite probability is to be obtained unless we have in each case some
such limitation in the number of the ultimate alternatives.
It was in a manner which bears fundamental resemblances to this
that Bacon endeavoured to demonstrate the cogency of his method.
He considers, he says, “the simple forms or difference of things which
are few in number, and the degrees and co-ordinations whereof make
all this variety,” And in Valerius Terminus he argues “that every
particular that worketh any effect is a thing compounded more or less
of diverse single natures, more manifest and more obscure, and that
it appeareth not to which of the natures the effect is to be ascribed.” *
It is indeed essential to the method of exclusions that the matter to
which it is applied should be somehow resolvable into a finite number
of elements. But this assumption is not peculiar, I think, to Bacon’s
*Quoted by Ellis, vol. i. p. 41.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 312
method, and is involved, in some form or other, in every argument
from Analogy. In making it Bacon was initiating, perhaps obscurely,
the modern conception of a finite number of laws of nature out of
the combinations of which the almost boundless variety of experience
ultimately arises. Bacon’s error was double and lay in supposing,
first, that these distinct elements lie upon the surface and consist in
visible characters, and second, that their natures are, or easily can
be, known to us, although the part of the Instauration, in which
the manner of conceiving simple natures was to be explained, he
never wrote. These beliefs falsely simplified the problem as he saw
it, and led him to exaggerate the ease, certainty, and fruitfulness of
the new method. But the view that it is possible to reduce all the
phenomena of the universe to combinations of a limited number of
simple elements—which is, according to Ellis,*
the central point of
Bacon’s whole system—was a real contribution to philosophy.
7. The assumption that every event can be analysed into
a limited number of ultimate elements, is never, so far as I am
aware, explicitly avowed by Mill. But he makes it in almost every
chapter, and it underlies, throughout, his mode of procedure. His
methods and arguments would fail immediately, if we were to suppose
that phenomena of infinite complexity, due to an infinite number of
independent elements, were in question, or if an infinite plurality of
causes had to be allowed for.
In distinguishing, therefore, analogy from pure induction, and
in justifying it by the assumption of a limited complexity in the
problems which we investigate, I am, I think, pursuing, with numerous
differences, the line of thought which Bacon first pursued and which
Mill popularised. The method of treatment is dissimilar, but the
subject-matter and the underlying beliefs are, in each case, the same.
8. Between Bacon and Mill came Hume. Hume’s sceptical
criticisms are usually associated with causality; but argument by
*Vol. i. p. 28.
ch. xxiii INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 313
induction—inference from past particulars to future generalisations—
was the real object of his attack. Hume showed, not that inductive
methods were false, but that their validity had never been established
and that all possible lines of proof seemed equally unpromising. The
full force of Hume’s attack and the nature of the difficulties which
it brought to light were never appreciated by Mill, and he makes no
adequate attempt to deal with them. Hume’s statement of the case
against induction has never been improved upon; and the successive
attempts of philosophers, led by Kant, to discover a transcendental
solution have prevented them from meeting the hostile arguments on
their own ground and from finding a solution along lines which might,
conceivably, have satisfied Hume himself.
9. It would not be just here to pass by entirely the name of the
great Leibniz, who, wiser in correspondence and fragmentary projects
than in completed discourses, has left to us sufficient indications
that his private reflections on this subject were much in advance
of his contemporaries’. He distinguished three degrees of conviction
amongst opinions, logical certainty (or, as we should say, propositions
known to be formally true), physical certainty which is only logical
probability, of which a well-established induction, as that man is a
biped, is the type, and physical probability (or, as we should say,
an inductive correlation), as for example that the south is a rainy
quarter.* He condemned generalisations based on mere repetition
of instances, which he declared to be without logical value, and
he insisted on the importance of Analogy as the basis of a valid
induction.† He regarded a hypothesis as more probable in proportion
to its simplicity and its power, that is to say, to the number of
the phenomena it would explain and the fewness of the assumptions
it involved. In particular a power of accurate prediction and of
explaining phenomena or experiments previously untried is a just
ground of secure confidence, of which he cites as a nearly perfect

example the key to a cryptogram.*
10. Whewell and Jevons furnished logicians with a storehouse
of examples derived from the practice of scientists. Jevons, partly
anticipated by Laplace, made an important advance when he
emphasised the close relation between Induction and Probability.
Combining insight and error, he spoilt brilliant suggestions by erratic
and atrocious arguments. His application of Inverse Probability to
the inductive problem is crude and fallacious, but the idea which
underlies it is substantially good. He, too, made explicit the element
of Analogy, which Mill, though he constantly employed it, had seldom
called by its right name. There are few books, so superficial in
argument yet suggesting so much truth, as Jevons’s Principles of
Science.
11. Modern text-books on Logic all contain their chapters
on Induction, but contribute little to the subject. Their recognition
of Mill’s inadequacy renders their exposition, which, in spite of
criticisms, is generally along his lines, nerveless and confused. Where
Mill is clear and offers a solution, they, confusedly criticising, must
withhold one. The best of them, Sigwart and Venn, contain criticism
and discussion which is interesting, but constructive theory is lacking.
Hitherto Hume has been master, only to be refuted in the manner of
Diogenes or Dr. Johnson.
*Letter to Conring, 19th March 1678.
NOTES ON PART III
(i.) On the Use of the Term Induction
1. Induction is in origin a translation of the Aristotelian
?pa????. This term was used by Aristotle in two quite distinct
senses—first, and principally, for the process by which the observation
of particular instances, in which an abstract notion is exemplified,
enables us to realise and comprehend the abstraction itself; secondly,
for the type of argument in which we generalise after the complete
enumeration and assertion of all the particulars which the generalisation
embraces. From this second sense it was sometimes extended
to cases in which we generalise after an incomplete enumeration. In
post-Aristotelian writers the induction per enumerationem simplicem
approximates to induction in Aristotle’s second sense, as the number
of instances is increased. To Bacon, therefore, “the induction of which
the logicians speak” meant a method of argument by multiplication
of instances. He himself deliberately extended the use of the term so
as to cover all the systematic processes of empirical generalisation.
But he also used it, in a manner closely corresponding to Aristotle’s
first use, for the process of forming scientific conceptions and correct
notions of “simple natures.” *
2. The modern use of the term is derived from Bacon’s.
Mill defines it as “the operation of discovering and proving general
propositions.” His philosophical system required that he should define
it as widely as this; but the term has really been used, both by
him and by other logicians, in a narrower sense, so as to cover those
methods of proving general propositions, which we call empirical, and
so as to exclude generalisations, such as those of mathematics, which
have been proved formally. Jevons was led, partly by the linguistic
*See Ellis’s edition of Bacon’s Works, vol. i. p. 37. On the first occasion
on which Induction is mentioned in the Novum Organum, it is used in this
secondary sense.

pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 316
resemblance, partly because in the one case we proceed from the
particular to the general and in the other from the general to the
particular, to define Induction as the inverse process of Deduction.
In contemporary logic Mill’s use prevails; but there is, at the same
time, a suggestion—arising from earlier usage, and because Bacon
and Mill never quite freed themselves from it—of argument by mere
multiplication of instances. I have thought it best, therefore, to use
the term pure induction to describe arguments which are based upon
the number of instances, and to use induction itself for all those types
of arguments which combine, in one form or another, pure induction
with analogy.
(ii.) On the Use of the Term Cause
1. Throughout the preceding argument, as well as in Part II., I
have been able to avoid the metaphysical difficulties which surround
the true meaning of cause. It was not necessary that I should inquire
whether I meant by causal connection an invariable connection in
fact merely, or whether some more intimate relation was involved. It
has also been convenient to speak of causal relations between objects
which do not strictly stand in the position of cause and effect, and
even to speak of a probable cause, where there is no implication of
necessity and where the antecedents will sometimes lead to particular
consequents and sometimes will not. In making this use of the
term, I have followed a practice not uncommon amongst writers on
probability, who constantly use the term cause, where hypothesis
might seem more appropriate.*
One is led, almost inevitably, to use ‘cause’ more widely than
‘sufficient cause’ or than ‘necessary cause,’ because, the necessary
*Cf. Czuber, Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, p. 139. In dealing with Inverse
Probability Czuber explains that he means by possible cause the various
Bedingungskomplexe from which the cause can result.
notes INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 317
causation of particulars by particulars being rarely apparent to us,
the strict sense of the term has little utility. Those antecedent
circumstances, which we are usually content to accept as causes, are
only so in strictness under a favourable conjunction of innumerable
other influences.
2. As our knowledge is partial, there is constantly, in our use of
the term cause, some reference implied or expressed to a limited body
of knowledge. It is clear that, whether or not, as Cournot* maintains,
there are such things as independent series in the order of causation,
there is often a sense in which we may hold that there is a closer
intimacy between some series than between others. This intimacy is
relative, I think, to particular information, which is actually known to
us, or which is within our reach. It will be useful, therefore, to give
precise definitions of these wider senses in which it is often convenient
to use the expression cause.
We must first distinguish between assertions of law and assertions
of fact, or, in the terminology of Von Kries,† between nomologic
and ontologic knowledge. It may be convenient in dealing with
some questions to frame this distinction with reference to the special
circumstances. But the distinction generally applicable is between
propositions which contain no reference to particular moments of
time, and existential propositions which cannot be stated without
reference to specific points in the time series. The Principle of the
Uniformity of Nature amounts to the assertion that natural laws are
all, in this sense, timeless. We may, therefore, divide our data into
two portions k and l, such that k denotes our formal and nomologic
evidence, consisting of propositions whose predication does not involve
a particular time reference, and l denotes the existential or ontologic
propositions.
3. Let us now suppose that we are investigating two existential
propositions a and b, which refer two events A and B to particular
*See Chapter XXIV. § 3.
†Die Principien der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, p. 86.
pt. iii A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 318
moments of time, and that A is referred to moments which are all
prior to those at which B occurred. What various meanings can we
give to the assertion that A and B are causally connected?
(i.) If b/ak = 1, A is a sufficient cause of B. In this case A is a
cause of B in the strictest sense. b can be inferred from a, and no
additional knowledge consistent with k can invalidate this.
(ii.) If b/ak¯ = 0, A is a necessary cause of B.
(iii.) If k includes all the laws of the existent universe, then A is
not a sufficient cause of B unless b/ak = 1. The Law of Causation,
therefore, which states that every existent has to some other previous
existent the relation of effect to sufficient cause, is equivalent to the
proposition that, if k is the body of natural law, then, if b is true,
there is always another true proposition a, which asserts existences
prior to B, such that b/ak = 1. No use has been made so far
of our existential knowledge l, which is irrelevant to the definitions
preceding.
(iv.) If b/akl = 1 and b/kl =| 1, A is a sufficient cause of B under
conditions l.
(v.) If b/akl ¯ = 0 and b/kl =| 0, A is a necessary cause of B under
conditions l.
(vi.) If there is any existential proposition h such that b/ahk = 1
and b/hk =| 1, A is, relative to k, a possible sufficient cause of B.
(vii.) If there is an existential proposition h such that b/ahk ¯ = 0
and b/hk =| 0, A is, relative to k, a possible necessary cause of B.
(viii.) If b/ahkl = 1, b/hk =| 1, and h/akl =| 0, A is, relative to k,
a possible sufficient cause of B under conditions l.
(ix.) If b/ahkl ¯ = 0, b/hkl =| 0, h/akl ¯ = 0, and h/akl =| 0, A is,
relative to k, a possible necessary cause of B under conditions l. Thus
an event is a possible necessary cause of another, relative to given
nomologic data, if circumstances can arise, not inconsistent with our
existential data, in which the first event will be indispensable if the
second is to occur.
(x.) Two events are causally independent if no part of either
notes INDUCTION AND ANALOGY 319
is, relative to our nomologic data, a possible cause of any part of
the other under the conditions of our existential knowledge. The
greater the scope of our existential knowledge, the greater is the
likelihood of our being able to pronounce events causally dependent
or independent.
4. These definitions preserve the distinction between ‘causally
independent’ and ‘independent for probability,’—the distinction between
causa essendi and causa cognoscendi. If b/ahkl =| b/ahkl ¯ , where
a and b may be any propositions whatever and are not limited as they
were in the causal definitions, we have ‘dependence for probability,’
and a is a causa cognoscendi for b, relative to data kl. If a and b are
causally dependent, according to definition (x.), b is a possible causa
essendi, relative to data kl.
But, after all, the essential relation is that of ‘independence for
probability.’ We wish to know whether knowledge of one fact throws
light of any kind upon the likelihood of another. The theory of
causality is only important because it is thought that by means
of its assumptions light can be thrown by the experience of one
phenomenon upon the expectation of another.
PART IV
some philosophical applications
of probability
CHAPTER XXIV
the meanings of objective chance, and of
randomness
1. Many important differences of opinion in the treatment
of Probability have been due to confusion or vagueness as to what
is meant by Randomness and by Objective Chance, as distinguished
from what, for the purposes of this chapter, may be termed Subjective
Probability. It is agreed that there is a sort of Probability which
depends upon knowledge and ignorance, and is relative, in some
manner, to the mind of the subject; but it is supposed that there
is also a more objective Probability which is not thus dependent,
or less completely so, though precisely what this conception stands
for is not plain. The relation of Randomness to the other concepts
is also obscure. The problem of clearing up these distinctions is of
importance if we are to criticise certain schools of opinion intelligently,
as well as to the treatment of the foundations of Statistical Inference
which is to be attempted in Part V.
There are at least three distinct issues to be kept apart. There is
the antithesis between knowledge and ignorance, between events, that
is to say, which we have some reason to expect, and events which we
have no reason to expect, which gives rise to the theory of subjective
probability and subjective chance; and, connected with this, the
distinction between ‘random’ selection and ‘biassed’ selection. There
are next objective probability and objective chance, which are as yet
obscure, but which are commonly held to arise out of the antithesis
between ‘cause’ and ‘chance,’ between events, that is to say, which are
causally connected and events which are not causally connected. And
there is, lastly, the antithesis between chance and design, between
‘blind causes’ and ‘final causes,’ where we oppose a ‘chance’ event to
one, part of whose cause is a volition following on a conscious desire
321
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 322
for the event.*
2. The method of this treatise has been to regard subjective
probability as fundamental and to treat all other relevant conceptions
as derivative from this. That there is such a thing as probability in
this sense has been admitted by all sensible philosophers since the
middle of the eighteenth century at least.† But there is also, many
writers have supposed, something else which may be fitly described as
objective probability; and there is, besides, a long tradition in favour
of the view that it is this (whatever it may be) which is logically and
philosophically important, subjective probability being a vague and
mainly psychological conception about which there is very little to be
said.
The distinction exists already in Hume: “Probability is of two
kinds, either when the object is really in itself uncertain, and to be
determined by chance; or when, though the object be already certain,
yet ’tis uncertain to our judgment, which finds a number of proofs
on each side of the question.” ‡ But the distinction is not elucidated,
and one can only infer from other passages that Hume did not intend
to imply in this passage the existence of objective chance in a sense
contradictory to a determinist theory of the Universe. In Condorcet
all is confused; and in Laplace nearly all. In the nineteenth century
the distinction begins to grow explicit in the writings of Cournot.
“Les explications que j’ai données. . . ,” he writes in the preface to
his Exposition, “sur le double sens du mot de probabilité, qui tantôt
se rapporte à une certaine mesure de nos connaissances, et tantôt
à une mesure de la possibilité des choses, indépendamment de la
*This is discussed in Chapter XXV. § 4.
†D’Alembert, collecting (largely from Hume, many passages being translated
almost verbatim) in the Encyclopédie méthodique the most up-to-date commonplaces
of the subject, found it natural to write: “Il n’y a point de hasard à
proprement parler; mais il y a son équivalent: l’ignorance, où nous sommes des
vraies causes des événemens, a sur notre esprit l’influence qu’on suppose au
hasard.” Compare also the sentences from Spinoza quoted on p. 117 above.
‡A Treatise of Human Nature, Book ii. part iii. section ix.
ch. xxiv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 323
connaissance que nous en avons: ces explications, dis-je, me semblent
propres à resoudre les difficultés qui ont rendu jusqu’ici suspecte à
de bons esprits toute la théorie de la probabilité mathématique.” It
will be worth while to pause for a moment to consider the ideas of
Cournot.
3. Cournot, while admitting that there is such a thing as
subjective chance, was concerned to dispute the opinion that chance is
merely the offspring of ignorance, saying that in this case “le calcul des
chances” is merely “un calcul des illusions.” The chance, upon which
“le calcul des chances” is based, is something different, and depends,
according to him, on the combination or convergence of phenomena
belonging to independent series. By “independent series” he means
series of phenomena which develop as parallel or successive series
without any causal interdependence or link of solidarity whatever.*
No one, he says by way of example, seriously believes that in striking
the ground with his foot he puts out the navigator in the Antipodes,
or disturbs the system of Jupiter’s satellites. Separate trains of
events, that is to say, have been set going by distinct initial acts
of creation, so to speak.† Every event is causally connected with
previous events belonging to its own series, but it cannot be modified
by contact with events belonging to a different series. A ‘chance’
*
“Le mot hasard,” Cournot writes in his Essai sur les fondemenis de nos
connaissances, “n’indique pas une cause substantielle, mais une idée: cette idée
est celle de la combinaison entre plusieurs séries de causes ou de faits qui se
développent chacun dans sa série propre, indépendamment les uns des autres.”
This is very like the definition given by Jean de la Placette in his Traité des
jeux de hasard, to which Cournot refers: “Pour moi, je suis persuadé que le
hasard renferme quelque chose de réal et de positif, savoir un concours de deux
ou plusieurs événements contingents, chacun desquels a ses causes, mais en sorte
que leur concours n’en a aucune que l’on connaisse.”
†Essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances, i. 134: “La nature ne se
gouverne pas par une loi unique. . . ses lois ne sont pas toutes dérivées les unes
des autres, on dérivées toutes d’une loi supérieure par une nécessité purement
logique. . . nous devons les concevoir au contraire comme ayant pu étre décrétées
séparément d’une infinité de manières.”
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 324
event is a complex due to the concurrence in time or place of events
belonging to causally independent series.
This theory, as it stands, is evidently unsatisfactory. Even if there
are series of phenomena which are independent in Cournot’s sense,
it is not clear how we can know which they are, or how we can
set up a calculus which presumes an acquaintance with them. Just
as it is likely that we are all cousins if we go back far enough, so
there may be, after all, remote relationships between ourselves and
Jupiter. A remote connection or a reaction quantitatively small is a
matter of degree and not by any means the same thing as absolute
independence. Nevertheless Cournot has contributed something, I
think, to the stock of our ideas. He has hinted at, even if he has not
disentangled, one of the elements in a common conception of chance;
and of the notion, which he seems to have in his mind, we must in
due course take account.*
4. In the writings of Condorcet, I have said above, all is confused.
But in Bertrand’s criticism of him a relevant distinction, though not
elucidated, is brought before the mind. “The motives for believing,”
wrote Condorcet, “that, from ten million white balls mixed with one
*Cournot’s work on Probability has been highly praised by authorities as
diverse and distinguished as Boole and Von Kries, and has been made the
foundation of a school by some recent French philosophers (see the special
number of the Revue de métaphysique et de morale, devoted to Cournot and
published in 1905, and the bibliography at the end of the present volume
passim). The best account with which I am acquainted, of Cournot’s theory of
probability, is to be found in A. Darbon’s Le Concept du hasard. Cournot’s
philosophy of the subject is developed, not so much in his Exposition de la
théorie des chances, as in later works, especially in his Essai sur les fondements
de nos connaissances. Cournot never touched any subject without contributing
something to it, but, on the whole, his work on Probability is, in my opinion,
disappointing. No doubt his Exposition is superior to other French text-books
of the period, of which there is so large a variety, and his work, both here and
elsewhere, is not without illuminating ideas: but the philosophical treatment is
so confused and indefinite that it is difficult to make much of it beyond the one
specific point treated above.
ch. xxiv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 325
black, it will not be the black ball which I shall draw at the first
attempt is of the same kind as the motive for believing that the sun
will not fail to rise to-morrow.” “The assimilation of the two cases,”
Bertrand writes in criticism of the above,*
“is not legitimate: one of
the probabilities is objective, the other subjective. The probability
of drawing the black ball at the first attempt is 1
10,000,000 , neither
more nor less. Whoever evaluates it otherwise makes a mistake. The
probability that the sun will rise varies from one mind to another.
A scientist might hold on the basis of a false theory, without being
utterly irrational, that the sun will soon be extinguished; he would
be within his rights, just as Condorcet is within his; both would
exceed their rights in accusing of error those who think differently.”
Before commenting on this distinction, let us have before us also some
interesting passages by Poincaré.
5. We certainly do not use the term ‘chance,’ Poincaré points
out, as the ancients used it, in opposition to determinism. For us
therefore the natural interpretation of ‘chance’ is subjective,—‘Chance
is only the measure of our ignorance. Fortuitous phenomena are, by
definition, those, of the laws of which we are ignorant.” But Poincaré
immediately adds: “Is this definition very satisfactory? When the first
Chaldaean shepherds followed with their eyes the movements of the
stars, they did not yet know the laws of astronomy, but would they
have dreamed of saying that the stars move by chance? If a modern
physicist is studying a new phenomenon, and if he discovers its law
on Tuesday, would he have said on Monday that the phenomenon was
fortuitous?” †
There is also another type of case in which “chance must be
something more than the name we give to our ignorance.” Among the
*Calcul des probabilités, p. xix.
†Calcul des probabilités (2nd edition), p. 2. This passage also appears in an
article in the Revue du mois for 1907 and in the author’s Science et méthode, of
the English translation of which I have made use above,—at the cost of doing
incomplete justice to Poincaré’s most admirable style.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 326
phenomena, of the causes of which we are ignorant, there are some,
such as those dealt with by the manager of a life insurance company,
about which the calculus of probabilities can give real information.
Surely it cannot be thanks to our ignorance, Poincaré urges, that
we are able to arrive at valuable conclusions. If it were, it would
be necessary to answer an inquirer thus: “You ask me to predict
the phenomena that will be produced. If I had the misfortune to
know the laws of these phenomena, I could not succeed except by
inextricable calculations, and I should have to give up the attempt to
answer you; but since I am fortunate enough to be ignorant of them,
I will give you an answer at once. And, what is more extraordinary
still, my answer will be right.” The ignorance of the manager of the
life insurance company as to the prospects of life of his individual
policy-holders does not prevent his being able to pay dividends to his
shareholders.
Both these distinctions seem to be real ones, and Poincaré
proceeds to examine further instances in which we seem to distinguish
objectively between events according as they are or are not due to
‘chance.’ He takes the case of a cone balanced upon its tip; we
know for certain that it will fall, but not on which side—chance will
determine. “A very small cause which escapes our notice determines
a considerable effect that we cannot fail to see, and then we say that
that effect is due to chance.” The weather, and the distribution of
the minor planets on the Zodiac, are analogous instances. And what
we term ‘games of chance’ afford, it has always been recognised, an
almost perfect example. “It may happen that small differences in the
initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena.
A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the
latter. Prediction becomes impossible, and we have the fortuitous
phenomenon.” “The greatest chance is the birth of a great man. It is
only by chance that the meeting occurs of two genital cells of different
sex that contain precisely, each on its side, the mysterious elements,
the mutual reaction of which is destined to produce genius. . . . How
ch. xxiv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 327
little it would have taken to make the spermatozoid which carried
them deviate from its course. It would have been enough to deflect
it a hundredth part of an inch, and Napoleon would not have been
born and the destinies of a continent changed. No example can give
a better comprehension of the true character of chance.”
Poincaré calls attention next to another class of events, which we
commonly assign to ‘chance,’ the distinguishing characteristic of which
seems to be that their causes are very numerous and complex,—the
motions of molecules of gas, the distribution of drops of rain, the
shuffling of a pack of cards, or the errors of observation. Thirdly
there is the type, usually connected with one of the first two, and
specially emphasised, as we have seen above, by Cournot, in which
something comes about through the concurrence of events which we
regard as belonging to distinct causal trains,—a man is walking along
the street and is killed by the fall of a tile.
6. When we attribute such events, as those illustrated by
Poincaré, to chance, we certainly do not mean merely to assert that
we do not know how they arose or that we had no special reason
for anticipating them à priori. So far from this being the case, we
mean to make a definite assertion as to the kind of way in which
they arose;—though exactly what we mean to assert about them it is
extremely difficult to say.
Now a careful examination of all the cases in which various
writers claim to detect the presence of ‘objective chance’ confirms
the view that ‘subjective chance,’ which is concerned with knowledge
and ignorance, is fundamental, and that so-called ‘objective chance,’
however important it may turn out to be from the practical or
scientific point of view, is really a special kind of ‘subjective chance’
and a derivative type of the latter. For none of the adherents
of ‘objective chance’ wish to question the determinist character of
natural order; and the possibility of this objective chance of theirs
seems always to depend on the possibility that a particular kind of
knowledge either is ours or is within our powers and capacity. Let me
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 328
try to distinguish as exactly as I can the criterion of objective chance.
7. When we say that an event has happened by chance, we
do not mean that previous to its occurrence the event was, on the
available evidence, very improbable; this may or may not have been
the case. We say, for example, that if a coin falls heads it is ‘by
chance,’ whereas its falling heads is not at all improbable. The term
‘by chance’ has reference rather to the state of our information about
the concurrence of the event considered and the event premised.
The fall of the coin is a chance event if our knowledge of the
circumstances of the throw is irrelevant to our expectation of the
possible alternative results. If the number of alternatives is very
large, then the occurrence of the event is not only subject to chance
but is also very improbable. In general two events may be said to
have a chance connection, in the subjective sense, when knowledge of
the first is irrelevant to our expectation of the second, and produces
no additional presumption for or against it; when, that is to say, the
probabilities of the propositions asserting them are independent in
the sense defined in Chapter XII. § 8.
The above definition deals with chance in the widest sense. What
is the differentia of the narrower group of cases to which it is desired
to apply the term ‘objective chance’? The occurrence of an event may
be said to be subject to objective chance, I think, when it is not only
a chance event in the above sense, but when we also have good reason
to suppose that the addition of further knowledge of a given kind, if
it were procurable, would not affect its chance character. We must
consider, that is to say, the probability which is relative not to actual
knowledge but to the whole of a certain kind of knowledge. We may
be able to infer from our evidence that, even with certain kinds of
additions to our knowledge, the connections between the events would
still be subject to chance in the sense just defined, and we may be
able to infer this without actually having the additional information
in question. If, however complete our knowledge of certain kinds of
things might be, there would still exist independence between the
ch. xxiv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 329
propositions, the conjunction of which we are investigating, then we
may say there is an objective sense in which the actual conjunction of
these propositions is due to chance.
8. This is, I think, the right line of inquiry. It remains to decide,
what kinds of information must be irrelevant to the connection, in
order that the presence of objective chance may be established.
When we attribute a coincidence to objective chance, we mean
not only that we do not actually know a law of connection, but,
speaking roughly, that there is no law of connection to be known.
And when we say that the occurrence of one alternative rather than
another is due to chance, we mean not only that we know no principle
by which to choose between the alternatives, but also that no such
principle is knowable. This use of the term closely corresponds to
what Venn means by the term ‘casual’: “We call a coincidence casual,
I apprehend, when we mean to imply that no knowledge of one of
the two elements, which we can suppose to be practically attainable,
would enable us to expect the other.” *
To make this more precise, we must revive our distinction,† between
nomologic knowledge and ontologic knowledge, between knowledge of
laws and knowledge of facts or existence. Given certain facts f(a)
about a and certain laws of connection, L, we can infer certainly or
probably other facts f(a) about a. If a complete knowledge of laws
of connection together with f(a) yields no appreciable probability for
preferring f(a) to other alternatives, then I suggest that an actual
connection between f and f in a particular instance may be said
to be due to chance in a sense which usage justifies us in calling
objective. We do not, in fact, when we speak of objective chance,
always use it in so strict a sense as this, but this is, I think, the
underlying conception to which current usage approximates. Current
usage diverges from this sense mainly for two reasons. We speak of
objective chance if in the above conditions our grounds for preference,
*Logic of Chance, p. 245.
†See Part III. Note (ii.) § 2, p. 316.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 330
though appreciable, are very small; and we are not insistent to assert
the rule of chance if a comparatively slight addition to our ontologic
knowledge would render the probability or the grounds for preference
appreciable.
To sum up the above, an event is due to objective chance if in order
to predict it, or to prefer it to alternatives, at present equiprobable,
with any high degree of probability, it would be necessary to know
a great many more facts of existence about it than we actually do
know, and if the addition of a wide knowledge of general principles
would be little use.
It must be added that we make a distinction between facts of
existence which are highly variable from case to case and those which
are constant or nearly constant over a certain field of observation or
experience. Within the limits of this field we regard the permanent
facts of existence as being, from the standpoint of chance, in nearly
the same position as laws. A connection is not due to chance,
therefore, if a knowledge of the permanent facts of existence could
lead to their prediction.
To sum up again therefore,—if within a given field of observation
or experience a knowledge of those facts of existence which are
permanent or invariable within that field, together with a knowledge
of all the relevant fundamental causal laws or general principles, and
of a few other facts of existence, would not permit us, given f(a),
to attribute an appreciable probability to f(a) (or an appreciable
probability to the alternative f1(a) rather than f2(a)); then the
conjunction of f(a) (or of f1(a) rather than f2(a) with f(a)) is due
to objective chance.
9. If we return to the examples of Poincaré, the above definition
appears to conform satisfactorily with the usages of common sense. It
is when an exact knowledge of fact, as distinguished from principle, is
required for even approximate prediction that the expression ‘objective
chance’ seems applicable. But neither our definition nor usage is
precise as to the amount of knowledge of fact which must be required
ch. xxiv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 331
for prediction, in order that, in the absence of it, the event may be
regarded as subject to objective chance.
It may be added that the expression ‘chance’ can be used with
reference to general statements as well as to particular facts. We
say, for example, that it is a matter of chance if a man dies on his
birthday, meaning that, as a general principle and in the absence
of special information bearing on a particular case, there is no
presumption whatever in favour of his dying on his birthday rather
than on any other day. If as a general rule there were celebrations
on such a day such as would be not unlikely to accelerate death, we
should say that a man’s dying on his birthday was not altogether a
matter of chance. If we knew no such general rule but did not know
enough about birthdays to be assured that there was no such rule, we
could not call the chance ‘objective’; we could only speak of it thus,
if on the evidence before us there was a strong presumption against
the existence of any such general rule.
10. The philosophical and scientific importance of objective
chance as defined above cannot be made plain, until Part V., on
the Foundations of Statistical Inference, has been reached. There it
will appear in more than one connection, but chiefly in connection
with the application of Bernoulli’s formula. In cases where the use
of this formula is valid, important inferences can be drawn; and it
will he shown that, when the conditions for objective chance are
approximately satisfied, it is probable that the conditions for the
application of Bernoulli’s formula will be approximately satisfied also.
11. The term random has been used, it is well recognised, in
several distinct senses. Venn* and other adherents of the ‘frequency’
theory have given to it a precise meaning, but one which has avowedly
very little relation to popular usage. A random sample, says Peirce,†
*Logic of Chance, chap. v., “The Conception Randomness and its Scientific
Treatment.”
†
“A Theory of Probable Inference” (published in Johns Hopkins Studies in
Logic), p. 152.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 332
is one “taken according to a precept or method, which, being applied
over and over again indefinitely, would in the long run result in the
drawing of any one set of instances as often as any other set of
the same number.” The same fundamental idea has been expressed
with greater precision by Professor Edgeworth in connection with his
investigations into the law of error.*
It is a fatal objection, in my
opinion, to this mode of defining randomness, that in general we
can only know whether or not we have a random sample when our
knowledge is nearly complete. Its divergence from ordinary usage is
well illustrated by the fact that there would be perfect randomness in
the distribution of stars in the heavens, as Venn explicitly points out,
if they were disposed in an exact and symmetrical pattern.†
I do not believe, therefore, that this kind of definition is a useful
one. The term must be defined with reference to probability, not to
what will happen “in the long run”; though there may be two senses of
it, corresponding to subjective and objective probability respectively.
The most important phrase in which the term is used is that of ‘a
random selection’ or ‘taken at random.’ When we apply this term to
a particular member of a series or collection of objects, we may mean
one of two things. We may mean that our knowledge of the method
of choosing the particular member is such that à priori the member
chosen is as likely to be any one member of the series as any other.
We may also mean, not that we have no knowledge as to which
particular member is in question, but that such knowledge as we
have respecting the particular member, as distinguished from other
members of the series, is irrelevant to the question as to whether or
not this member has the characteristic under examination. In the
first case the particular member is a random member of the series for
*
“Law of Error,” Camb. Phil. Trans., 1904, p. 128.
†But it may be added that this seems inconsistent with Venn’s conception
of randomness as that of aggregate order and individual irregularity; nor is it
concordant with Venn’s typically random diagram (p. 118). His usage, therefore,
is sometimes nearer than his definition to the popular usage.
ch. xxiv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 333
all characteristics; in the second case it is a random member for some
only. As the second case is the more general, we had better take that
for the purpose of defining ‘random selection.’
The point will be brought out further if we discuss the more
difficult use of the term. What exactly do we mean by the statement:
“Any number, taken at random, is equally likely to be odd or
even”? According to the frequency theory, this simply means that
there are as many odd numbers as there are even. Taking it in
a sense corresponding to subjective chance (and to the explanations
given above), I propose as a definition the following: a is taken
at random from the class S for the purposes of the propositional
function S(x)  f(x), relative to evidence h, if ‘x is a’ is irrelevant to
the probability f(x)/S(x)  h. Thus ‘the number of the inhabitants
of France is odd’ is, relative to my knowledge, a random instance
of the propositional function ‘x is an odd number,’ since ‘a is the
number of the inhabitants of France’ is irrelevant to the probability
of ‘a is odd’.* Thus to say that a number taken at random is as
likely to be odd as even, means that there is a probability 1
2
that
any instance taken at random of the generalisation ‘all numbers are
odd’ (or of the corresponding generalisation ‘all numbers are even’)
is true; an instance being taken at random in respect of evenness
or oddness, if our knowledge about it satisfies the conditions defined
above. Whether or not a given instance is taken at random, depends,
therefore, upon what generalisation is in question.
12. We may or may not have reason to believe that, if we take a
series of random selections, the proportionate number of occurrences
of one particular type of result will very probably lie within certain
limits. For reasons to be explained in Chapter XXIX., random
selection relative to such information may conveniently be termed
‘random selection under Bernoullian conditions.’ It is this kind of
random selection which is scientifically and statistically important.
*
In the above S(x) stands for ‘x is a number’, f(x) stands for ‘x is odd,’
a stands for ‘the number of inhabitants of France.’
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 334
But, as this corresponds to ‘objective chance,’ it is convenient to have
a wider definition of ‘random selection’ unqualified, corresponding
to ‘subjective chance’; and it is this wider definition which is given
above.
The term opposite to ‘random selection’ in ordinary usage is
‘biassed selection.’ When I use this phrase without qualification
I shall use it as the opposite of ‘random selection’ in the wider
unqualified sense.
CHAPTER XXV
some problems arising out of the discussion of
chance
1. There are two classical problems in which attempts have
been made to attribute certain astronomical phenomena to a specific
cause, rather than to objective chance in some such sense as has been
defined in the preceding chapter.
The first of these is concerned with the inclinations to the ecliptic
of the orbits of the planets of the solar system. This problem has a
long history, but it will be sufficient to take De Morgan’s statement of
it.*
If we suppose that each of the orbits might have any inclination,
we obtain a vast number of combinations of which only a small
number are such that their sum is as small or smaller than the sum
of those of the actual system. But the very existence of ourselves
and our world can be shown to imply that one of this small number
has been selected, and De Morgan derives from this an enormous
presumption that “there was a necessary cause in the formation of the
solar system for the inclinations being what they are.”
The answer to this was pointed out by D’Alembert†
in criticising
*Article on Probabilities in Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, p. 412, § 46.
De Morgan takes this without acknowledgment from Laplace, Théorie analytique
des probabilités (1st edition), pp. 257, 258. Laplace also allows for the fact
that all the planets move in the same sense as the earth. He concludes: “On
verra que l’existence d’une cause commune qui a dirigé tous ces mouvemens
dans le sens de la rotation du soleil, et sur des plans peu inclinés à celui de
son équateur, est indiquée avec une probabilité bien supérieure à celle du plus
grand nombre des faits historiques sur lesquels on ne se permet aucun doute.”
Laplace had in his turn borrowed the example, also without acknowledgment,
from Daniel Bernoulli. See also D’Alembert, Opuscules mathématiques, vol. iv.,
1768, pp. 89 and 292.
†Op. cit. p. 292. “Il y a certainement d’infini contre un à parier que les
Planètes ne devraient pas se trouver dans le même plan; ce n’est pas une raison
pour en conclure que cette disposition, si elle avoit lieu, auroit nécessairement

pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 336
Daniel Bernoulli. De Morgan could have reached a similar result
whatever the configuration might have happened to be. Any arbitrary
disposition over the celestial sphere is vastly improbable à priori, that
is to say in the absence of known laws tending to favour particular
arrangements. It does not follow from this, as De Morgan argues, that
any actual disposition possesses à posteriori a peculiar significance.
2. The second of these problems is known as Michell’s problem
of binary stars. Michell’s Memoir was published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1767.*
It deals with the question as to whether
stars which are optically double, i.e. which are so situated as to
appear close together to an observer on the earth—are also physically
so “either by an original act of the Creator, or in consequence of
some general law, such perhaps as gravity.” He argues that if the
stars “were scattered by mere chance as it might happen . . . it is
manifest . . . that every star being as likely to be in any one situation
as another, the probability that any one particular star should happen
to be within a certain distance (as, for example, one degree) of
any other given star would be represented . . . by a fraction whose
numerator would be to its denominator as a circle of one degree radius
to a circle whose radius is the diameter of a great circle . . . that
is, about 1 in 13131.” From this beginning he derives an immense
presumption against the scattering of the several contiguous stars
that may be observed “by mere chance as it might happen.” And
d’autre cause que le hasard; car il y auroit de même l’infini contre un à parier
que les Planètes pourroient n’avoir pas une certaine disposition déterminée à
volonté. . . .”
D’Alembert is employing the instance for his own purposes, in order to build
up an ad hominem argument in favour of his theory concerning ‘runs’ against
D. Bernoulli (see also p. 363).
*See also Todhunter’s History, pp. 332–4; Venn, Logic of Chance, p. 260;
Forbes, “On the Alleged Evidence for a Physical Connexion between Stars
forming Binary or Multiple Groups, deduced from the Doctrine of Chances,”
Phil. Mag., 1850, and Boole, “On the Theory of Probabilities and in particular
on Michell’s Problem of the Distribution of the Fixed Stars,” Phil. Mag., 1851.
ch. xxv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 337
he goes on to argue that, if there are causal laws directly tending to
produce the observed proximities, we may reasonably suppose that
the proximities are actual, and not merely optical and apparent. The
fact that Michell’s induction was confirmed by the later investigations
of Herschell adds interest to the speculation. But apart from this
the argument is evidently subtler than in the first example. Michell
argues that there are more stars optically contiguous, than would be
likely if there were no special cause acting towards this end, and
further that, if such a cause is in operation, it must be real, and not
merely optical, contiguity that results from it.
Let us analyse the argument more closely. By “mere chance as it
might happen” Michell cannot be supposed to mean “uncaused.” He
is thinking of objective chance in the sense in which I have defined
this in the preceding chapter. We speak of a chance occurrence when
it is brought about by the coincidence of forces and circumstances so
numerous and complex that knowledge sufficient for its prediction is
of a kind altogether out of our reach. Michell uses the term vaguely
but means, I think, something of this kind: An event is due to mere
chance when it can only occur if a large number of independent*
conditions are fulfilled simultaneously. The alternatives which Michell
is discussing are therefore these: Are binary stars merely due to
the interaction of a vast variety of stellar laws and positions or are
they the result of a few fundamental tendencies, which might be the
subject of knowledge and which would lead us to expect such stars in
relative profusion?
The existence of numerous binary stars may give a real inductive
argument in favour of their arising out of the interaction of a relatively
small number of independent causes. But it is not possible to arrive
at such precise results as Michell’s. If there is some finite probability
à priori that binary stars, when they arise, do arise in this way,
then, since the frequent coincidence of a given set of independent
*See § 3 of Note (ii.) to Part III.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 338
causes relatively few in number is more likely than that of a set
relatively numerous, the observation of binary stars will raise this
probability à posteriori to an extent which depends upon the relative
profusion in which such stars appear. If, in short, the first of
the two alternatives proposed above is assumed, there is no greater
presumption for a distribution, covering a part of the heavens, in
which binary stars appear, than for any other distribution; if the
second is assumed, there is a greater presumption. The observation
of numerous distributions in which binary stars appear increases,
therefore, by the inverse principle, any à priori probability which
may exist in favour of the second hypothesis. But more than this the
argument cannot justify. That Michell’s argument is, as it stands, no
more valid than De Morgan’s, becomes plain when we notice that he
would still have a high probability for his conclusion even if only one
binary star had been observed. The valuable part of the argument
must clearly turn upon the observation of numerous binary stars.
Let us now turn to Michell’s second step. He argues that, if binary
stars arise out of the interaction of a small number of independent
forces, they must be physically and not merely optically double. The
force of this argument seems to depend upon our possessing previous
knowledge as to the nature of the principal natural laws, and upon
an assumption, arising out of this, that there are not likely to be
forces tending to arrange stars, in reality at great distances from
one another, so as to appear double from this particular planet.
But Michell, in arguing thus, was neglecting the possibility that the
optical connection between the stars might be due to the observer
and his means of observation. It was not impossible that there should
be a law, connected with the transmission of light for example, which
would cause stars to appear to an observer to be much nearer together
than they really are.
While, therefore, a relative profusion of binary stars constitutes
evidence favourably relevant to Michell’s conclusion, the argument
is more complex and much less conclusive than he seems to have
ch. xxv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 339
supposed. This is a criticism which is applicable to many such
arguments. The simplicity of the evidence, which arises out of the
lack of much relevant information, is liable, unless we are careful,
to lead us into deceptive calculations and into assertions of high
numerical probabilities, upon which we should never venture in cases
where the evidence is full and complicated, but where, in fact, the
conclusion is established far more strongly. The enormously high
probability in favour of his conclusion, to which Michell’s calculations
led him, should itself have caused him to suspect the accuracy of the
reasoning by which he reached it.
3. Some more recent problems of this type seem, however, so
far as I am acquainted with them, to follow safer lines of argument.
The most important are concerned with the existence of star drifts.
It seems to me not at all impossible to possess data on which a
valid argument can be constructed from the observation of optically
apparent star drifts to the probability of a real uniformity of motion
amongst certain sets of stars relatively to others.
Another problem, somewhat analogous to the preceding, has been
recently discussed by Professor Karl Pearson.* The title might prove
a little misleading, perhaps, until the explanation has been reached
of the sense in which the term ‘random’ is used in it. But Professor
Pearson uses the term in a perfectly precise sense. He defines a
random distribution as one in which spherical shells of equal volume
about the sun as centre contain the same number of stars.† He argues
that the observed facts render probable the following disjunction:
Either the distribution of stars is not random in the sense defined
above, or there is a correlation between their distance and their
brilliancy, such as might be produced, for example, by the absorption
*
“On the Improbability of a Random Distribution of the Stars in Space,”
Proceedings of Royal Society, series A, vol. 84, pp. 47–70, 1910.
†
It is, therefore, independent of direction, and the distribution is random
even if the stars are massed in particular quarters of the heavens. The definition
is, therefore, exceedingly arbitrary.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 340
of light in its transmission through space, or the space within which
they all lie is limited in volume and not spherical in form.* But it
is useless to employ the term random in this sense in such inquiries
as Michell’s. For there is no reason to suppose that a non-*random
distribution is more likely than a random distribution to depend
upon the interaction of a small number of independent forces, and
there might even exist a presumption the other way. This arbitrary
interpretation of randomness does not help us to the solution of any
interesting problem.
4. The discussion of final causes and of the argument from design
has suffered confusion from its supposed connection with theology.
But the logical problem is plain and can be determined upon formal
and abstract considerations. The argument is in all cases simply
this—an event has occurred and has been observed which would be
very improbable à priori if we did not know that it had actually
happened; on the other hand, the event is of such a character that it
might have been not unreasonably predicted if we had assumed the
existence of a conscious agent whose motives are of a certain kind
and whose powers are sufficient.
Symbolically: Let h be our original data, a the occurrence of the
event, b the existence of the supposed conscious agent. Then a/h is
assumed very small in comparison with a/bh; and we require b/ah, the
probability, that is to say, of b after a is known. The inverse principle
of probability already demonstrated shows that b/ah = a/bh 
b/h
a/h,
and b/ah is therefore not determinate in terms of a/bh and a/h alone.
Thus we cannot measure the probability of the conscious agent’s
existence after the event, unless we can measure its probability before
the event. And it is our ignorance of this, as a rule, that we are
endeavouring to remedy. The argument tells us that the existence of
the hypothetical agent is more likely after the event than before it;
*This should run more correctly, I think, “not a sphere with the sun as
centre.”
ch. xxv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 341
but, as in the case of the general inductive problem dealt with in
Part III., unless there is an appreciable probability first, there cannot
be an appreciable probability afterwards. No conclusion, therefore,
which is worth having, can be based on the argument from design
alone; like induction, this type of argument can only strengthen the
probability of conclusions, for which there is something to be said on
other grounds. We cannot say, for example, that the human eye is
due to design more probably than not, unless we have some reason,
apart from the nature of its construction, for suspecting conscious
workmanship. But the necessary à priori probability, derived from
some other source, may sometimes be forthcoming. The man who
upon a desert island picks up a watch, or who sees the symbol John
Smith traced upon the sand, can use with reason the argument from
design. For he has other grounds for supposing that beings, capable
of designing such objects, do exist, and that their presence on the
island, now or formerly, is appreciably possible.
5. The most important problems at the present day,
in which arguments of this kind are employed, are those which
arise in connection with psychical research.* The analysis of the
‘cross-correspondences,’ which have played so large a part in recent
discussions, presents many points of difficulty which are not dissimilar
to those which arise in other scientific inquiries of great complexity
in which our initial knowledge is small. An important part of the
logical problem, therefore, is to distinguish the peculiarity of psychical
problems and to discover what special evidence they demand beyond
what is required when we deal with other questions. There is a certain
*The probability that a remarkable success in naming playing cards is due
to psychic agency, was discussed by Professor Edgeworth in Metretike. This
was, I think, the first application of probabilities to these questions. See also
Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, Parts VIII. and X.; Professor
Edgeworth’s article on Psychical Research and Statistical Method, Stat. Journ.
vol. lxxxii. (1919) p. 222; and Experiments in Psychical Research at Leland
Stanford Junior University, by J. Coover.

tendency, I think, arising out of the belief that psychical problems are
in some way peculiar, to raise sceptical doubts against them, which
are equally valid against all scientific proofs. Without entering into
any questions of detail, let us endeavour to separate those difficulties
which seem peculiar to psychical research from those which, however
great, are not different from the difficulties which confront students
of heredity, for instance, and which are not less likely than these to
yield ultimately to the patience and the insight of investigators.
For this purpose it is necessary to recur, briefly, to the analysis of
Part III. It was argued there that the methods of empirical proof,
by which we strengthen the probability of our conclusions, are not
at all dissimilar, when we apply them to the discovery of formal
truth, and when we apply them to the discovery of the laws which
relate material objects, and that they may possibly prove useful even
in the case of metaphysics; but that the initial probability which
we strengthen by these means is differently obtained in each class
of problem. In logic it arises out of the postulate that apparent
self-evidence invests what seems self-evident with some degree of
probability; and in physical science, out of the postulate that there
is a limitation to the amount of independent variety amongst the
qualities of material objects. But both in logic and in physical
science we may wish to consider hypotheses which it is not possible
to invest with any à priori probability and which we entertain solely
on account of the known truth of many of their consequences. An
axiom which has no self-evidence, but which it seems necessary to
combine with other axioms which are self-evident in order to deduce
the generally accepted body of formal truth, stands in this category.
A scientific entity, such as the ether or the electron, whose qualities
have never been observed but whose existence we postulate for
purposes of explanation, stands in it also. If the analysis of Part
III. is correct, we can never attribute a finite probability*
to the
*
I am assuming that there is no argument, arising either from self-evidence
or analogy, in addition to the argument arising from the truth of their
ch. xxv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 343
truth of such axioms or to the existence of such scientific entities,
however many of their consequences we find to be true. They may
be convenient hypotheses, because, if we confine ourselves to certain
classes of their consequences, we are not likely to be led into error;
but they stand, nevertheless, in a position altogether different from
that of such generalisations as we have reason to invest with an initial
probability.
Let us now apply these distinctions to the problems of psychical
research. In the case of some of them we can obtain the initial
probability, I think, by the same kind of postulates as in physical
science, and our conclusions need not be open to a greater degree
of doubt than these. In the case of others we cannot; and these
must remain, unless some method is open to us peculiar to psychical
research, as tentative unproved hypotheses in the same category as
the ether.
The best example of the first class is afforded by telepathy. We
know that the consciousnesses which, if our hypothesis is correct, act
upon one another, do exist; and I see no logical difference between
the problem of establishing a law of telepathy and that of establishing
the law of gravitation. There is at present a practical difference on
account of the much narrower scope of our knowledge, in the case
of telepathy, of cognate matters. We can, therefore, be much less
certain; but there seems no reason why we should necessarily remain
less certain after more evidence has been accumulated. It is important
to remember that, in the case of telepathy, we are merely discovering
a relation between objects which we already know to exist.
The best example of the other class is afforded by attempts to
attribute psychic phenomena to the agency of ‘spirits’ other than
consequences, in favour of the truth of such axioms or the existence of such
objects; but I daresay that this may not certainly be the case. The reader may
be reminded also that, when I deny a finite probability this is not the same
thing as to affirm that the probability is infinitely small. I mean simply that it
is not greater than some numerically measurable probability.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 344
human beings. Such arguments are weakened at present by the fact
that no phenomena are known, so far as I am aware, which cannot be
explained, though improbably in some cases, in other ways. But even
if phenomena were to be observed of which no known agency could
afford even an improbable explanation, the hypothesis of ‘spirits’
would still lie in the same logical limbo as the hypothesis of the
‘ether,’ in which they might be supposed not inappropriately to move.
Such an hypothesis as the existence of ‘spirits’ could only become
substantial if some peculiar method of knowledge were within our
power which would yield us the initial probability which is demanded.
That such a method exists, it is not infrequently claimed. If we can
directly perceive these ‘spirits,’ as many of those who are described
in James’s Varieties of Religious Experience think they can, the
problem is, logically, altogether changed. We have, in fact, very much
the same kind of reason, though it may be with less probability,
that we have for believing in the existence of other people. The
preceding paragraph applies only to attempts at proving the existence
of ‘spirits’ from such evidence as is discussed by the Society for
Psychical Research.
In between these two extremes comes a class of cases, with regard
to which it is extremely difficult to come to a decision—that of
attempts to attribute psychic phenomena to the conscious agency of
the dead. I wish to discuss here, not the nature of the existing
evidence, but the question whether it is possible for any evidence
to be convincing. In this case the object whose existence we are
endeavouring to demonstrate resembles in many respects objects
which we know to exist. The question of epistemology, which is
before us, is this: Is it necessary, in order that we may have an
initial probability, that the object of our hypothesis should resemble
in every relevant particular some one object which we know to exist,
or is it sufficient that we should know instances of all its supposed
qualities, though never in combination? It is clear that some qualities
may be irrelevant—position in time and space, for example—and
ch. xxv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 345
that ‘every relevant particular’ need not include these. But can the
initial probability exist if our hypothesis assumes qualities, which
have plainly some degree of relevance, in new combinations? If we
have no knowledge of consciousness existing apart from a living body,
can indirect evidence of whatever character afford us any probability
of such a thing? Could any evidence, for example, persuade us that
a tree felt the emotion of amusement, even if it laughed repeatedly
when we made jokes? Yet the analogy which we demand seems to
be a matter of degree; for it does not seem unreasonable to attribute
consciousness to dogs, although this constitutes a combination of
qualities unlike in many respects to any which we know to exist.
This discussion, however, is wandering from the subject of
probability to that of epistemology, and it will not be solved until
we possess a more comprehensive account of this latter subject than
we have at present. I wish only to distinguish between those cases
in which we obtain the initial probability in the same manner as in
physical science from those in which we must get it, if at all, in some
other way. The distinctions I have made are sufficiently summarised
by a recapitulation of the following comparisons: We compared the
proof of telepathy to the proof of gravitation, the proof of non-human
‘spirits’ to the proof of the ether, and, much less closely, the proof
of the consciousness of the dead to the proof of the consciousness of
trees, or, perhaps, of dogs.
Before passing to the next of the rather miscellaneous topics of
this chapter, it may be worth while to add that we should be very
chary of applying to problems of psychical research the calculus of
probabilities. The alternatives seldom satisfy the conditions for the
application of the Principle of Indifference, and the initial probabilities
are not capable of being measured numerically. If, therefore, we
endeavour to calculate the probability that some phenomenon is due
to ‘abnormal’ causes, our mathematics will be apt to lead us into
unjustifiable conclusions.
6. Uninstructed common sense seems to be specially unreliable
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 346
in dealing with what are termed ‘remarkable occurrences.’ Unless
a ‘remarkable occurrence’ is simply one which produces on us a
particular psychological effect, that of surprise, we can only define
it as an event which before its occurrence is very improbable on
the available evidence. But it will often occur—whenever, in fact,
our data leave open the possibility of a large number of alternatives
and show no preference for any of them—that every possibility is
exceedingly improbable à priori. It follows, therefore, that what
actually occurs does not derive any peculiar significance merely from
the fact of its being ‘remarkable’ in the above sense. Something
further is required before we can build with success. Yet Michell’s
argument and the argument from design derive a good deal of their
plausibility, I think, from the ‘remarkable’ character of the actual
constitution whether of the heavens or of the universe, in forgetfulness
of the fact that it is impossible to propound any constitution which
would if it existed be other than ‘remarkable.’ It is supposed that
a remarkable occurrence is specially in need of an explanation, and
that any sufficient explanation has a high probability in its favour.
That an explanation is particularly required, possesses a measure of
truth; for it is likely that our original data were much lacking in
completeness, and the occurrence of the extraordinary event brings to
light this deficiency. But that we are not justified in adopting with
confidence any sufficient explanation, has been shown already.
Such arguments, however, get a part of their plausibility from
a quite different source. There is a general supposition that some
kinds of occurrences are more likely than others to be susceptible of
an explanation by us; and, therefore, any explanation which deals
with such cases falls in prepared soil. Results which, judging from
ourselves, conscious agents would be likely to produce fall into this
category. Results which would be probable, supposing a direct
and predominant causal dependence between the elements whose
concomitance is remarked, belong to it also. There is, in fact, a sort
of argument from analogy as to whether certain sorts of phenomena
ch. xxv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 347
are or are not likely to be due to ‘chance.’ This may explain, for
example, why the particular concurrence of atoms that go to compose
the human eye, why a series of correct guesses in naming playing
cards, why special symmetry or special asymmetry amongst the stars,
seem to require explanation in no ordinary degree. Prior to an
explanation these particular concurrences or series or distributions
are no more improbable than any other. But the causes of such
conjunctions as these are more likely to be discoverable by the human
mind than are the causes of others, and the attempt to explain them
deserves, therefore, to be more carefully considered. This supposition,
derived by analogy or induction from those cases in which we believe
the causes to be known to us, has, perhaps, some weight. But the
direct application of the Calculus of Probabilities can do no more in
these cases than suggest matter for investigation. The fact that a
man has made a long series of correct guesses in cases where he is cut
off from the ordinary channels of communication, is a fact worthy of
investigation, because it is more likely to be susceptible of a simple
causal explanation, which may have many applications, than a case
in which false and true guesses follow one another with no apparent
regularity.
7. In the case of empirical laws, such as Bode’s law, which
have no more than a very slight connection with the general body
of scientific knowledge, it is sometimes thought that the law is more
probable if it is proposed before the examination of some or all of
the available instances than if it is proposed after their examination.
Supposing, for example, that Bode’s law is accurately true for seven
planets, it is held that the law would be more probable if it was
suggested after the examination of six and was confirmed by the
subsequent discovery of the seventh, than it would be if it had
not been propounded until after all seven had been observed. The
arguments in favour of such a conclusion are well put by Peirce:*
“All
*C. S. Peirce, A Theory of Probable Inference, pp. 162–167; published in
Johns Hopkins Studies in Logic, 1883.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 348
the qualities of objects may be conceived to result from variations of
a number of continuous variables; hence any lot of objects possesses
some character in common, not possessed by any other.” Hence if
the common character is not predesignate we can conclude nothing.
Cases must not be used to prove a generalisation which has only been
suggested by the cases themselves. He takes the first five poets from
a biographical dictionary with their ages at death:
Aagard . . . . . . . . . . . . 48 Abunowas . . . . . . . 48
Abeille . . . . . . . . . . . . .76 Accords . . . . . . . . . .45
Abulola . . . . . . . . . . . . 84
“These five ages have the following characters in common:
“1. The difference of the two digits composing the number,
divided by three, leaves a remainder of one.
“2. The first digit raised to the power indicated by the second,
and then divided by three, leaves a remainder of one.
“3. The sum of the prime factors of each age, including one as
a prime factor, is divisible by three.”
He compares a generalisation regarding the ages of poets based
on this evidence to Dr. Lyon Playfair’s argument about the specific
gravities of the three allotropic forms of carbon:
Diamond . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .3.48 = v2
12
Graphite . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.29 = v3
12
Charcoal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.88 = v4
12
approximately, the atomic weight of carbon being 12. Dr. Playfair
thinks that the above renders it probable that the specific gravities
of the allotropic forms of other elements would, if we knew them, be
found to equal the different roots of their atomic weight.
The weakness of these arguments, however, has a different
explanation. These inductions are very improbable, because they are
out of relation to the rest of our knowledge and are based on a
very small number of instances. The apparent absurdity, moreover,
ch. xxv PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 349
of the inductive law of Poets’ Ages is increased by the fact that we
take account of the knowledge we actually possess that the ages of
poets are not in fact connected by any such law. If we knew nothing
whatever about poets’ ages except what is stated above, the induction
would be as valid as any other which is based on a very weak analogy
and a very small number of instances and is unsupported by indirect
evidence.
The peculiar virtue of prediction or predesignation is altogether
imaginary. The number of instances examined and the analogy
between them are the essential points, and the question as to whether
a particular hypothesis happens to be propounded before or after
their examination is quite irrelevant. If all our inductions had to be
thought of before we examined the cases to which we apply them,
we should, doubtless, make fewer inductions; but there is no reason
to think that the few we should make would be any better than
the many from which we should be precluded. The plausibility of
the argument is derived from a different source. If an hypothesis is
proposed à priori, this commonly means that there is some ground
for it, arising out of our previous knowledge, apart from the purely
inductive ground, and if such is the case the hypothesis is clearly
stronger than one which reposes on inductive grounds only. But if
it is a mere guess, the lucky fact of its preceding some or all of the
cases which verify it adds nothing whatever to its value. It is the
union of prior knowledge, with the inductive grounds which arise out
of the immediate instances, that lends weight to an hypothesis, and
not the occasion on which the hypothesis is first proposed. It is
sometimes said, to give another example, that the daily fulfilment of
the predictions of the Nautical Almanack constitutes the most cogent
proof of the laws of dynamics. But here the essence of the verification
lies in the variety of cases which can be brought accurately under our
notice by means of the Almanack, and in the fact that they have
all been obtained on a uniform principle, not in the fact that the
verification is preceded by a prediction.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 350
The same point arises not uncommonly in statistical inquiries. If
a theory is first proposed and is then confirmed by the examination
of statistics, we are inclined to attach more weight to it than to a
theory which is constructed in order to suit the statistics. But the
fact that the theory which precedes the statistics is more likely than
the other to be supported by general considerations—for it has not,
presumably, been adopted for no reason at all—constitutes the only
valid ground for this preference. If it does not receive more support
than the other from general considerations, then the circumstances of
its origin are no argument in its favour. The opposite view, which the
unreliability of some statisticians has brought into existence,—that
it is a positive advantage to approach statistical evidence without
preconceptions based on general grounds, because the temptation to
‘cook’ the evidence will prove otherwise to be irresistible,—has no
logical basis and need only be considered when the impartiality of an
investigator is in doubt.
CHAPTER XXVI
the application of probability to conduct
1. Given as our basis what knowledge we actually have, the
probable, I have said, is that which it is rational for us to believe.
This is not a definition. For it is not rational for us to believe that
the probable is true; it is only rational to have a probable belief in
it or to believe it in preference to alternative beliefs. To believe one
thing in preference to another, as distinct from believing the first
true or more probable and the second false or less probable, must
have reference to action and must be a loose way of expressing the
propriety of acting on one hypothesis rather than on another. We
might put it, therefore, that the probable is the hypothesis on which
it is rational for us to act. It is, however, not so simple as this, for
the obvious reason that of two hypotheses it may be rational to act
on the less probable if it leads to the greater good. We cannot say
more at present than that the probability of a hypothesis is one of
the things to be determined and taken account of before acting on it.
2. I do not know of passages in the ancient philosophers which
explicitly point out the dependence of the duty of pursuing goods
on the reasonable or probable expectation of attaining them relative
to the agent’s knowledge. This means only that analysis had not
disentangled the various elements in rational action, not that common
sense neglected them. Herodotus puts the point quite plainly. “There
is nothing more profitable for a man,” he says, “than to take good
counsel with himself; for even if the event turns out contrary to one’s
hope, still one’s decision was right, even though fortune has made it
of no effect: whereas if a man acts contrary to good counsel, although
by luck he gets what he had no right to expect, his decision was not
any the less foolish.” *
3. The first contact of theories of probability with modern
*Herod. vii. 10.
351
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 352
ethics appears in the Jesuit doctrine of probabilism. According to
this doctrine one is justified in doing an action for which there is any
probability, however small, of its results being the best possible. Thus,
if any priest is willing to permit an action, that fact affords some
probability in its favour, and one will not be damned for performing
it, however many other priests denounce it.*
It may be suspected,
however, that the object of this doctrine was not so much duty as
safety. The priest who permitted you so to act assumed thereby
the responsibility. The correct application of probability to conduct
naturally escaped the authors of a juridical ethics, which was more
interested in the fixing of responsibility for definite acts, and in the
various specified means by which responsibility might be disposed of,
than in the greatest possible sum-total of resultant good.
A more correct doctrine was brought to light by the efforts of the
philosophers of the Port Royal to expose the fallacies of probabilism.
“In order to judge,” they say, “of what we ought to do in order
to obtain a good and to avoid an evil, it is necessary to consider
not only the good and evil in themselves, but also the probability
of their happening and not happening, and to regard geometrically
the proportion which all these things have, taken together.” † Locke
perceived the same point, although not so clearly.‡ By Leibniz
this theory is advanced more explicitly; in such judgments, he
*Compare with this doctrine the following curious passage from Jeremy
Taylor:—“We being the persons that are to be persuaded, we must see that we
be persuaded reasonably. And it is unreasonable to assent to a lesser evidence
when a greater and clearer is propounded: but of that every man for himself is
to take cognisance, if he be able to judge; if he be not, he is not bound under
the tie of necessity to know anything of it. That that is necessary shall be
certainly conveyed to him: God, that best can, will certainly take care for that;
for if he does not, it becomes to be not necessary; or if it should still remain
necessary, and he be damned for not knowing it, and yet to know it be not in
his power, then who can help it! There can be no further care in this business.”
†The Port Royal Logic (1662), Eng. Trans. p. 367.
‡Essay concerning Human Understanding, book ii. chap. xxi. § 66.
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 353
says, “as in other estimates disparate and heterogeneous and, so to
speak, of more than one dimension, the greatness of that which is
discussed is in reason composed of both estimates (i.e. of goodness
and of probability), and is like a rectangle, in which there are two
considerations, viz. that of length and that of breadth. . . . Thus
we should still need the art of thinking and that of estimating
probabilities, besides the knowledge of the value of goods and evils,
in order properly to employ the art of consequences.” *
In his preface to the Analogy Butler insists on “the absolute and
formal obligation” under which even a low probability, if it is the
greatest, may lay us: “To us probability is the very guide of life.”
4. With the development of a utilitarian ethics largely concerned
with the summing up of consequences, the place of probability in
ethical theory has become much more explicit. But although the
general outlines of the problem are now clear, there are some elements
of confusion not yet dispersed. I will deal with some of them.
In his Principia Ethica (p. 152) Dr. Moore argues that “the first
difficulty in the way of establishing a probability that one course of
action will give a better total result than another, lies in the fact
that we have to take account of the effects of both throughout an
infinite future. . . . We can certainly only pretend to calculate the
effects of actions within what may be called an ‘immediate future.’. . .
We must, therefore, certainly have some reason to believe that no
consequences of our action in a further future will generally be such
as to reverse the balance of good that is probable in the future which
we can foresee. This large postulate must be made, if we are ever
to assert that the results of one action will be even probably better
than those of another. Our utter ignorance of the far future gives us
no justification for saying that it is even probably right to choose the
greater good within the region over which a probable forecast may
extend.”
*Nouveaux Essais, book ii. chap. xxi.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 354
This argument seems to me to be invalid and to depend on
a wrong philosophical interpretation of probability. Mr. Moore’s
reasoning endeavours to show that there is not even a probability by
showing that there is not a certainty. We must not, of course, have
reason to believe that remote consequences will generally be such
as to reverse the balance of immediate good. But we need not be
certain that the opposite is the case. If good is additive, if we have
reason to think that of two actions one produces more good than the
other in the near future, and if we have no means of discriminating
between their results in the distant future, then by what seems a
legitimate application of the Principle of Indifference we may suppose
that there is a probability in favour of the former action. Mr. Moore’s
argument must be derived from the empirical or frequency theory of
probability, according to which we must know for certain what will
happen generally (whatever that may mean) before we can assert a
probability.
The results of our endeavours are very uncertain, but we have a
genuine probability, even when the evidence upon which it is founded
is slight. The matter is truly stated by Bishop Butler: “From our
short views it is greatly uncertain whether this endeavour will, in
particular instances, produce an overbalance of happiness upon the
whole; since so many and distant things must come into the account.
And that which makes it our duty is that there is some appearance
that it will, and no positive appearance to balance this, on the
contrary side. . . .” *
The difficulties which exist are not chiefly due, I think, to our
ignorance of the remote future. The possibility of our knowing
that one thing rather than another is our duty depends upon the
assumption that a greater goodness in any part makes, in the absence
of evidence to the contrary, a greater goodness in the whole more
*This passage is from the Analogy. The Bishop adds: “. . . and also that
such benevolent endeavour is a cultivation of that most excellent of all virtuous
principles, the active principle of benevolence.”
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 355
probable than would the lesser goodness of the part. We assume
that the goodness of a part is favourably relevant to the goodness of
the whole. Without this assumption we have no reason, not even a
probable one, for preferring one action to any other on the whole.
If we suppose that goodness is always organic, whether the whole
is composed of simultaneous or successive parts, such an assumption
is not easily justified. The case is parallel to the question, whether
physical law is organic or atomic, discussed in Chapter XXI. § 6.
Nevertheless we can admit that goodness is partly organic and still
allow ourselves to draw probable conclusions. For the alternatives,
that either the goodness of the whole universe throughout time is
organic or the goodness of the universe is the arithmetic sum of the
goodnesses of infinitely numerous and infinitely divided parts, are not
exhaustive. We may suppose that the goodness of conscious persons
is organic for each distinct and individual personality. Or we may
suppose that, when conscious units are in conscious relationship, then
the whole which we must treat as organic includes both units. These
are only examples. We must suppose, in general, that the units whose
goodness we must regard as organic and indivisible are not always
larger than those the goodness of which we can perceive and judge
directly.
5. The difficulties, however, which are most fundamental from
the standpoint of the student of probability, are of a different kind.
Normal ethical theory at the present day, if there can be said to be
any such, makes two assumptions: first, that degrees of goodness
are numerically measurable and arithmetically additive, and second,
that degrees of probability also are numerically measurable. This
theory goes on to maintain that what we ought to add together,
when, in order to decide between two courses of action, we sum up
the results of each, are the ‘mathematical expectations’ of the several
results. ‘Mathematical expectation’ is a technical expression originally
derived from the scientific study of gambling and games of chance,
and stands for the product of the possible gain with the probability
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 356
of attaining it.*
In order to obtain, therefore, a measure of what
ought to be our preference in regard to various alternative courses of
action, we must sum for each course of action a series of terms made
up of the amounts of good which may attach to each of its possible
consequences, each multiplied by its appropriate probability.
The first assumption, that quantities of goodness are duly subject
to the laws of arithmetic, appears to me to be open to a certain
amount of doubt. But it would take me too far from my proper
subject to discuss it here, and I shall allow, for the purposes of further
argument, that in some sense and to some extent this assumption
can be justified. The second assumption, however, that degrees of
probability are wholly subject to the laws of arithmetic, runs directly
counter to the view which has been advocated in Part I. of this
treatise. Lastly, if both these points be waived, the doctrine that
the ‘mathematical expectations’ of alternative courses of action are
the proper measures of our degrees of preference is open to doubt on
two grounds—first, because it ignores what I have termed in Part I.
the ‘weights’ of the arguments, namely, the amount of evidence upon
which each probability is founded; and second, because it ignores the
element of ‘risk’ and assumes that an even chance of heaven or hell is
precisely as much to be desired as the certain attainment of a state of
mediocrity. Putting on one side the first of these grounds of doubt, I
will treat each of the others in turn.
6. In Chapter III. of Part I. I have argued that only in a
strictly limited class of cases are degrees of probability numerically
measurable. It follows from this that the ‘mathematical expectations’
*Priority in the conception of mathematical expectation can, I think, be
claimed by Leibniz, De incerti aestimatione, 1678 (Couturat, Logigue de Leibniz,
p. 248). In a letter to Placcius, 1687 (Dutens, vi. i. 36 and Couturat, op. cit.
p. 246) Leibniz proposed an application of the same principle to jurisprudence,
by virtue of which, if two litigants lay claim to a sum of money, and if the
claim of the one is twice as probable as that of the other, the sum should be
divided between them in that proportion. The doctrine, seems sensible, but I
am not aware that it has ever been acted on.
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 357
of goods or advantages are not always numerically measurable; and
hence, that even if a meaning can be given to the sum of a series
of non-numerical ‘mathematical expectations,’ not every pair of such
sums are numerically comparable in respect of more and less. Thus
even if we know the degree of advantage which might be obtained
from each of a series of alternative courses of actions and know also
the probability in each case of obtaining the advantage in question, it
is not always possible by a mere process of arithmetic to determine
which of the alternatives ought to be chosen. If, therefore, the
question of right action is under all circumstances a determinate
problem, it must be in virtue of an intuitive judgment directed to the
situation as a whole, and not in virtue of an arithmetical deduction
derived from a series of separate judgments directed to the individual
alternatives each treated in isolation.
We must accept the conclusion that, if one good is greater than
another, but the probability of attaining the first less than that of
attaining the second, the question of which it is our duty to pursue
may be indeterminate, unless we suppose it to be within our power
to make direct quantitative judgments of probability and goodness
jointly. It may be remarked, further, that the difficulty exists,
whether the numerical indeterminateness of the probability is intrinsic
or whether its numerical value is, as it is according to the Frequency
Theory and most other theories, simply unknown.
7. The second difficulty, to which attention is called above,
is the neglect of the ‘weights’ of arguments in the conception of
‘mathematical expectation.’ In Chapter VI. of Part I. the significance
of ‘weight’ has been discussed. In the present connection the question
comes to this—if two probabilities are equal in degree, ought we, in
choosing our course of action, to prefer that one which is based on a
greater body of knowledge?
The question appears to me to be highly perplexing, and it is
difficult to say much that is useful about it. But the degree of
completeness of the information upon which a probability is based
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 358
does seem to be relevant, as well as the actual magnitude of the
probability, in making practical decisions. Bernoulli’s maxim,*
that in
reckoning a probability we must take into account all the information
which we have, even when reinforced by Locke’s maxim that we must
get all the information we can,† does not seem completely to meet the
case. If, for one alternative, the available information is necessarily
small, that does not seem to be a consideration which ought to be
left out of account altogether.
8. The last difficulty concerns the question whether, the former
difficulties being waived, the ‘mathematical expectation’ of different
courses of action accurately measures what our preferences ought to
be—whether, that is to say, the undesirability of a given course of
action increases in direct proportion to any increase in the uncertainty
of its attaining its object, or whether some allowance ought to be
made for ‘risk,’ its undesirability increasing more than in proportion
to its uncertainty.
In fact the meaning of the judgment, that we ought to act in such
a way as to produce most probably the greatest sum of goodness, is
not perfectly plain. Does this mean that we ought so to act as to
make the sum of the goodnesses of each of the possible consequences
of our action multiplied by its probability a maximum? Those who
rely on the conception of ‘mathematical expectation’ must hold that
this is an indisputable proposition. The justifications for this view
most commonly advanced resemble that given by Condorcet in his
“Réflexions sur la règle générale, qui prescrit de prendre pour valeur
d’un événement incertain, la probabilité de cet événement multipliée
*Ars Conjectandi, p. 215: “Non sufficit expendere unum alterumve
argumentum, sed conquirenda sunt omnia, quae in cognitionem nostram venire
possunt, atqne ullo modo ad probationem rei facere videntur.”
†Essay concerning Human Understanding, book ii. chap. xxi. § 67: “He that
judges without informing himself to the utmost that he is capable, cannot acquit
himself of judging amiss.”
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 359
par la valeur de l’événement en lui-même,” * where he argues from
Bernoulli’s theorem that such a rule will lead to satisfactory results
if a very large number of trials be made. As, however, it will be
shown in Chapter XXIX. of Part V. that Bernoulli’s theorem is not
applicable in by any means every case, this argument is inadequate
as a general justification.
In the history of the subject, nevertheless, the theory of
‘mathematical expectation’ has been very seldom disputed. As
D’Alembert has been almost alone in casting serious doubts upon it
(though he only brought himself into disrepute by doing so), it will
be worth while to quote the main passage in which he declares his
scepticism: “Il me sembloit” (in reading Bernoulli’s Ars Conjectandi)
“que cette matière avoit besoin d’être traitée d’une manière plus
claire; je voyois bien que l’espérance étoit plus grande, 1o que la
somme espérée étoit plus grande, 2o que la probabilité de gagner
l’étoit aussi. Mais je ne voyois pas avec la même évidence, et je ne le
vois pas encore, 1o que la probabilité soit estimée exactement par les
méthodes usitées; 2o que quand elle le seroit, l’espérance doive être
proportionnelle à cette probabilité simple, plutôt qu’à une puissance
ou même à une fonction de cette probabilité; 3o que quand il y a
plusieurs combinaisons qui donnent différens avantages ou différens
risques (qu’on regarde comme des avantages négatifs) il faille se
contenter d’ajouter simplement ensemble toutes les espérances pour
avoir l’espérance totale.” †
In extreme cases it seems difficult to deny some force to
D’Alembert’s objection; and it was with reference to extreme cases
that he himself raised it. Is it certain that a larger good, which is
extremely improbable, is precisely equivalent ethically to a smaller
good which is proportionately more probable? We may doubt whether
the moral value of speculative and cautious action respectively can be
*Hist. de l’Acad., Paris, 1781.
†Opuscules mathématiques, vol. iv., 1768 (extraits de lettres), pp. 284, 285.
See also p. 88 of the same volume.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 360
weighed against one another in a simple arithmetical way, just as we
have already doubted whether a good whose probability can only be
determined on a slight basis of evidence can be compared by means
merely of the magnitude of this probability with another good whose
likelihood is based on completer knowledge.
There seems, at any rate, a good deal to be said for the conclusion
that, other things being equal, that course of action is preferable
which involves least risk, and about the results of which we have
the most complete knowledge. In marginal cases, therefore, the
coefficients of weight and risk as well as that of probability are
relevant to our conclusion. It seems natural to suppose that they
should exert some influence in other cases also, the only difficulty in
this being the lack of any principle for the calculation of the degree
of their influence. A high weight and the absence of risk increase pro
tanto the desirability of the action to which they refer, but we cannot
measure the amount of the increase.
The ‘risk’ may be defined in some such way as follows. If A is the
amount of good which may result, p its probability (p + q = 1), and
E the value of the ‘mathematical expectation,’ so that E = pA, then
the ‘risk’ is R, where R = p(A - E) = p(1 - p)A = pqA = qE. This
may be put in another way: E measures the net immediate sacrifice
which should be made in the hope of obtaining A; q is the probability
that this sacrifice will be made in vain; so that qE is the ‘risk.’* The
ordinary theory supposes that the ethical value of an expectation is a
function of E only and is entirely independent of R.
*The theory of Risiko is briefly dealt with by Czuber, Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung,
vol. i. pp. 219 et seq. If R measures the first insurance, this
leads to a Risiko of the second order, R1 = qR = q
2E. This again may be
insured against, and by a sufficient number of such reinsurances the risk can be
completely shifted:
E + R1 + R2 + . . . = E(1 + q + q
2 + . . .) = E
1 - q
=
E
p
= A.
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 361
We could, if we liked, define a conventional coefficient c of weight
and risk, such as c =
2pw
(1 + q)(1 + w)
, where w measures the ‘weight,’
which is equal to unity when p = 1 and w = 1, and to zero when p = 0
or w = 0, and has an intermediate value in other cases.* But if doubts
as to the sufficiency of the conception of ‘mathematical expectation’
be sustained, it is not likely that the solution will lie, as D’Alembert
suggests, and as has been exemplified above, in the discovery of some
more complicated function of the probability wherewith to compound
the proposed good. The judgment of goodness and the judgment of
probability both involve somewhere an element of direct apprehension,
and both are quantitative. We have raised a doubt as to whether
the magnitude of the ‘oughtness’ of an action can be in all cases
directly determined by simply multiplying together the magnitudes
obtained in the two direct judgments; and a new direct judgment
may be required, respecting the magnitude of the ‘oughtness’ of an
action under given circumstances, which need not bear any simple
and necessary relation to the two former.
The hope, which sustained many investigators in the course of the
nineteenth century, of gradually bringing the moral sciences under
the sway of mathematical reasoning, steadily recedes—if we mean,
as they meant, by mathematics the introduction of precise numerical
methods. The old assumptions, that all quantity is numerical and
that all quantitative characteristics are additive, can be no longer
sustained. Mathematical reasoning now appears as an aid in its
symbolic rather than in its numerical character. I, at any rate, have
not the same lively hope as Condorcet, or even as Edgeworth, “éclairer
les Sciences morales et politiques par le flambeau de l’Algèbre.” In
the present case, even if we are able to range goods in order of
magnitude, and also their probabilities in order of magnitude, yet it

does not follow that we can range the products composed of each
good and its corresponding probability in this order.
9. Discussions of the doctrine of Mathematical Expectation,
apart from its directly ethical bearing, have chiefly centred round the
classic Petersburg Paradox,* which has been treated by almost all
the more notable writers, and has been explained by them in a great
variety of ways. The Petersburg Paradox arises out of a game in
which Peter engages to pay Paul one shilling if a head appears at the
first toss of a coin, two shillings if it does not appear until the second,
and, in general, 2
r-1
shillings if no head appears until the r
th toss.
What is the value of Paul’s expectation, and what sum must he hand
over to Peter before the game commences, if the conditions are to be
fair?
The mathematical answer is Pn
1
(
1
2
)
r2
r-1
, if the number of tosses is
not in any case to exceed n in all, and P8
1
(
1
2
)
r2
r-1
if this restriction
is removed. That is to say, Paul should pay n
2
shillings in the first
case, and an infinite sum in the second. Nothing, it is said, could
be more paradoxical, and no sane Paul would engage on these terms
even with an honest Peter.
Many of the solutions which have been offered will occur at once
to the reader. The conditions of the game imply contradiction, say
Poisson and Condorcet; Peter has undertaken engagements which
he cannot fulfil; if the appearance of heads is deferred even to the
100th toss, he will owe a mass of silver greater in bulk than the sun.
But this is no answer. Peter has promised much and a belief in his
solvency will strain our imagination; but it is imaginable. And in any
case, as Bertrand points out, we may suppose the stakes to be, not
shillings, but grains of sand or molecules of hydrogen.
*For the history of this paradox see Todhunter. The name is due, he says,
to its having first appeared in a memoir by Daniel Bernoulli in the Commentarii
of the Petersburg Academy.
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 363
D’Alembert’s principal explanations are, first, that true expectation
is not necessarily the product of probability and profit (a view which
has been discussed above), and second, that very long runs are not
only very improbable, but do not occur at all.
The next type of solution is due, in the first instance, to Daniel
Bernoulli, and turns on the fact that no one but a miser regards the
desirability of different sums of money as directly proportional to their
amount; as Buffon says, “L’avare est comme le mathématicien: tous
deux estiment l’argent par sa quantité numérique.” Daniel Bernoulli
deduced a formula from the assumption that the importance of an
increment is inversely proportional to the size of the fortune to which
it is added. Thus, if x is the ‘physical’ fortune and y the ‘moral’
fortune,
dy = k
dx
x
,
or y = k log x
a
, where k and a are constants.
On the basis of this formula of Bernoulli’s a considerable theory
has been built up both by Bernoulli* himself and by Laplace.†
It
leads easily to the further formula—
x = (a + x1)p1(a + x2)p2 . . . ,
where a is the initial ‘physical’ fortune, p1, etc., the probabilities
of obtaining increments x1, etc., to a, and x the ‘physical’ fortune
whose present possession would yield the same ‘moral’ fortune as
does the expectation of the various increments x1, etc. By means of
this formula Bernoulli shows that a man whose fortune is £1000 may
reasonably pay a £6 stake in order to play the Petersburg game with
£1 units. Bernoulli also mentions two solutions proposed by Cramer.
In the first all sums greater than 2
24 (16, 777, 116) are regarded as

†Théorie analytique, chap. x. “De l’espérance morale,” pp. 432–445.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 364
‘morally’ equal; this leads to £13 as the fair stake. According to the
other formula the pleasure derivable from a sum of money varies as
the square root of the sum; this leads to £2 : 9s. as the fair stake.
But little object is served by following out these arbitrary hypotheses.
As a solution of the Petersburg problem this line of thought is
only partially successful: if increases of ‘physical’ fortune beyond a
certain finite limit can be regarded as ‘morally’ negligible, Peter’s
claim for an infinite initial stake from Paul is, it is true, no longer
equitable, but with any reasonable law of diminution for successive
increments Paul’s stake will still remain paradoxically large. Daniel
Bernoulli’s suggestion is, however, of considerable historical interest
as being the first explicit attempt to take account of the important
conception known to modern economists as the diminishing marginal
utility of money,—a conception on which many important arguments
are founded relating to taxation and the ideal distribution of wealth.
Each of the above solutions probably contains a part of the
psychological explanation. We are unwilling to be Paul, partly
because we do not believe Peter will pay us if we have good fortune
in the tossing, partly because we do not know what we should do
with so much money or sand or hydrogen if we won it, partly because
we do not believe we ever should win it, and partly because we do
not think it would be a rational act to risk an infinite sum or even a
very large finite sum for an infinitely larger one, whose attainment is
infinitely unlikely.
When we have made the proper hypotheses and have eliminated
these elements of psychological doubt, the theoretic dispersal of what
element of paradox remains must be brought about, I think, by a
development of the theory of risk. It is primarily the great risk of
the wager which deters us. Even in the case where the number of
tosses is in no case to exceed a finite number, the risk R, as already
defined, may be very great, and the relative risk R
E
will be almost
unity. Where there is no limit to the number of tosses, the risk is
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 365
infinite. A relative risk, which approaches unity, may, it has been
already suggested, be a factor which must be taken into account in
ethical calculation.
10. In establishing the doctrine, that all private gambling must
be with certainty a losing game, precisely contrary arguments are
employed to those which do service in the Petersburg problem. The
argument that “you must lose if only you go on long enough” is well
known. It is succinctly put by Laurent:* Two players A and B have
a and b francs respectively. f(a) is the chance that A will be ruined.
Thus f(a) = b
a + b
,
†
so that the poorer a gambler is, relatively to his
opponent, the more likely he is to be ruined. But further, if b = 8,
f(a) = 1, i.e. ruin is certain. The infinitely rich gambler is the public.
It is against the public that the professional gambler plays, and his
ruin is therefore certain.
Might not Poisson and Condorcet reply, The conditions of the
game imply contradiction, for no gambler plays, as this argument
supposes, for ever?‡ At the end of any finite quantity of play, the
player, even if he is not the public, may finish with winnings of
any finite size. The gambler is in a worse position if his capital is
smaller than his opponents’—at poker, for instance, or on the Stock
Exchange. This is clear. But our desire for moral improvement
outstrips our logic if we tell him that he must lose. Besides it is
paradoxical to say that everybody individually must lose and that
everybody collectively must win. For every individual gambler who
loses there is an individual gambler or syndicate of gamblers who win.
The true moral is this, that poor men should not gamble and that
millionaires should do nothing else. But millionaires gain nothing by
gambling with one another, and until the poor man departs from the
*Calcul des probabilités, p. 129.
†This would possibly follow from the theorem of Daniel Bernoulli. The
reasoning by which Laurent obtains it seems to be the result of a mistake.
‡Cf. also Mr. Bradley, Logic, p. 217.
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 366
path of prudence the millionaire does not find his opportunity. If it
be replied that in fact most millionaires are men originally poor who
departed from the path of prudence, it must be admitted that the
poor man is not doomed with certainty. Thus the philosopher must
draw what comfort he can from the conclusion with which his theory
furnishes him, that millionaires are often fortunate fools who have
thriven on unfortunate ones.*
11. In conclusion we may discuss a little further the conception
of ‘moral’ risk, raised in § 8 and at the end of § 9. Bernoulli’s formula
crystallises the undoubted truth that the value of a sum of money to
a man varies according to the amount he already possesses. But does
the value of an amount of goodness also vary in this way? May it not
be true that the addition of a given good to a man who already enjoys
much good is less good than its bestowal on a man who has little? If
this is the case, it follows that a smaller but relatively certain good is
better than a greater but proportionately more uncertain good.
In order to assert this, we have only to accept a particular theory
of organic goodness, applications of which are common enough in the
mouths of political philosophers. It is at the root of all principles of
equality, which do not arise out of an assumed diminishing marginal
utility of money. It is behind the numerous arguments that an equal
distribution of benefits is better than a very unequal distribution. If
this is the case, it follows that, the sum of the goods of all parts
of a community taken together being fixed, the organic good of the
whole is greater the more equally the benefits are divided amongst
the individuals. If the doctrine is to be accepted, moral risks, like
financial risks, must not be undertaken unless they promise a profit
actuarially.
*From the social point of view, however, this moral against gambling may
be drawn—that those who start with the largest initial fortunes are most likely
to win, and that a given increment to the wealth of these benefits them, on the
assumption of a diminishing marginal utility of money, less than it injures those
from whom it is taken.
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 367
There is a great deal which could be said concerning such a
doctrine, but it would lead too far from what is relevant to the
study of Probability. One or two instances of its use, however,
may be taken from the literature of Probability. In his essay, “Sur
l’application du calcul des probabilités à l’inoculation de la petite
vérole,”* D’Alembert points out that the community would gain on
the average if, by sacrificing the lives of one in five of its citizens, it
could ensure the health of the rest, but he argues that no legislator
could have the right to order such a sacrifice. Galton, in his
Probability, the Foundation of Eugenics, employed an argument which
depends essentially on the same point. Suppose that the members of
a certain class cause an average detriment M to society, and that the
mischiefs done by the several individuals differ more or less from M by
amounts whose average is D, so that D is the average amount of the
individual deviations, all regarded as positive, from M; then, Galton
argued, the smaller D is, the stronger is the justification for taking
such drastic measures against the propagation of the class as would
be consonant to the feelings, if it were known that each individual
member caused a detriment M. The use of such arguments seems
to involve a qualification of the simple ethical doctrine that right
action should make the sum of the benefits of the several individual
consequences, each multiplied by its probability, a maximum.
On the other hand, the opposite view is taken in the Port Royal
Logic and by Butler, when they argue that everything ought to be
sacrificed for the hope of heaven, even if its attainment be thought
infinitely improbable, since “the smallest degree of facility for the
attainment of salvation is of higher value than all the blessings
of the world put together.” † The argument is, that we ought to
*Opuscules mathématiques, vol. ii.
†Port Royal Logic (Eng. trans.), p. 369: “It belongs to infinite things
alone, as eternity and salvation, that they cannot be equalled by any temporal
advantage; and thus we ought never to place them in the balance with any of
the things of the world. This is why the smallest degree of facility for the
pt. iv A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 368
follow a course of conduct which may with the slightest probability
lead to an infinite good, until it is logically disproved that such a
result of our action is impossible. The Emperor who embraced the
Roman Catholic religion, not because he believed it, but because it
offered insurance against a disaster whose future occurrence, however
improbable, he could not certainly disprove, may not have considered,
however, whether the product of an infinitesimal probability and an
infinite good might not lead to a finite or infinitesimal result. In
any case the argument does not enable us to choose between different
courses of conduct, unless we have reason to suppose that one path is
more likely than another to lead to infinite good.
12. In estimating the risk, ‘moral’ or ‘physical,’ it must be
remembered that we cannot necessarily apply to individual cases
results drawn from the observation of a long series resembling them
in some particular. I am thinking of such arguments as Buffon’s when
he names 1
10,000 as the limit, beyond which probability is negligible,
on the ground that, being the chance that a man of fifty-six taken at
random will die within a day, it is practically disregarded by a man of
fifty-six who knows his health to be good. “If a public lottery,” Gibbon
truly pointed out, “were drawn for the choice of an immediate victim,
and if our name were inscribed on one of the ten thousand tickets,
should we be perfectly easy?”
Bernoulli’s second axiom,*
that in reckoning a probability we must
take everything into account, is easily forgotten in these cases of
statistical probabilities. The statistical result is so attractive in its
definiteness that it leads us to forget the more vague though more
important considerations which may be, in a given particular case,
within our knowledge. To a stranger the probability that I shall send
a letter to the post unstamped may be derived from the statistics
of the Post Office; for me those figures would have but the slightest
attainment of salvation is of higher value than all the blessings of the world put
together. . . .”
*See p. 84.
ch. xxvi PHILOSOPHICAL APPLICATIONS 369
bearing upon the question.
13. It has been pointed out already that no knowledge of
probabilities, less in degree than certainty, helps us to know what
conclusions are true, and that there is no direct relation between the
truth of a proposition and its probability. Probability begins and ends
with probability. That a scientific investigation pursued on account
of its probability will generally lead to truth, rather than falsehood,
is at the best only probable. The proposition that a course of action
guided by the most probable considerations will generally lead to
success, is not certainly true and has nothing to recommend it but its
probability.
The importance of probability can only be derived from the
judgment that it is rational to be guided by it in action; and a
practical dependence on it can only be justified by a judgment that in
action we ought to act to take some account of it. It is for this reason
that probability is to us the “guide of life,” since to us, as Locke says,
“in the greatest part of our concernment, God has afforded only the
Twilight, as I may so say, of Probability, suitable, I presume, to that
state of Mediocrity and Probationership He has been pleased to place
us in here.”
PART V
the foundations of statistical
inference
CHAPTER XXVII
the nature of statistical inference
1. The Theory of Statistics, as it is now understood,*
can
be divided into two parts which are for many purposes better kept
distinct. The first function of the theory is purely descriptive. It
devises numerical and diagrammatic methods by which certain salient
characteristics of large groups of phenomena can be briefly described;
and it provides formulae by the aid of which we can measure or
summarise the variations in some particular character which we have
observed over a long series of events or instances. The second function
of the theory is inductive. It seeks to extend its description of certain
characteristics of observed events to the corresponding characteristics
of other events which have not been observed. This part of the
subject may be called the Theory of Statistical Inference; and it is
this which is closely bound up with the theory of probability.
2. The union of these two distinct theories in a single science
is natural. If, as is generally the case, the development of some
inductive conclusion which shall go beyond the actually observed
instances is our ultimate object, we naturally choose those modes of
description, while we are engaged in our preliminary investigation,
which are most capable of extension beyond the particular instances
which they primarily describe. But this union is also the occasion of
a great deal of confusion. The statistician, who is mainly interested in
the technical methods of his science, is less concerned to discover the
precise conditions in which a description can be legitimately extended
by induction. He slips somewhat easily from one to the other, and
having found a complete and satisfactory mode of description he may
take less pains over the transitional argument, which is to permit him
to use this description for the purposes of generalisation.
*See Yule, Introduction to Statistics, pp. 1–5, for a very interesting account
of the evolution of the meaning of the term statistics.
371
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 372
One or two examples will show how easy it is to slip from
description into generalisation. Suppose that we have a series
of similar objects one of the characteristics of which is under
observation;—a number of persons, for example, whose age at death
has been recorded. We note the proportion who die at each age,
and plot a diagram which displays these facts graphically. We then
determine by some method of curve fitting a mathematical frequency
curve which passes with close approximation through the points of
our diagram. If we are given the equation to this curve, the number of
persons who are comprised in the statistical series, and the degree of
approximation (whether to the nearest year or month) with which the
actual age has been recorded, we have a very complete and succinct
account of one particular characteristic of what may constitute a very
large mass of individual records. In providing this comprehensive
description the statistician has fulfilled his first function. But in
determining the accuracy with which this frequency curve can be
employed to determine the probability of death at a given age in
the population at large, he must pay attention to a new class of
considerations and must display a different kind of capacity. He must
take account of whatever extraneous knowledge may be available
regarding the sample of the population which came under observation,
and of the mode and conditions of the observations themselves. Much
of this may be of a vague kind, and most of it will be necessarily
incapable of exact, numerical, or statistical treatment. He is faced, in
fact, with the normal problems of inductive science, one of the data,
which must be taken into account, being given in a convenient and
manageable form by the methods of descriptive statistics.
Or suppose, again, that we are given, over a series of years, the
marriage rate and the output of the harvest in a certain area of
population. We wish to determine whether there is any apparent
degree of correspondence between the variations of the two within this
field of observation. It is technically difficult to measure such degree
of correspondence as may appear to exist between the variations in
ch. xxvii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 373
two series, the terms of which are in some manner associated in
couples,—by coincidence, in this case, of time and place. By the
method of correlation tables and correlation coefficients the descriptive
statistician is able to effect this object, and to present the inductive
scientist with a highly significant part of his data in a compact and
instructive form. But the statistician has not, in calculating these
coefficients of observed correlation, covered the whole ground of which
the inductive scientist must take cognisance. He has recorded the
results of the observations in circumstances where they cannot be
recorded so clearly without the aid of technical methods; but the
precise nature of the conditions in which the observations took place
and the numerous other considerations of one sort or another, of
which we must take account when we wish to generalise, are not
usually susceptible of numerical or statistical expression.
The truth of this is obvious; yet, not unnaturally, the more
complicated and technical the preliminary statistical investigations
become, the more prone inquirers are to mistake the statistical
description for an inductive generalisation.* This tendency, which has
existed in some degree, as, I think, the whole history of the subject
shows, from the eighteenth century down to the present time, has been
further encouraged by the terminology in ordinary use. For several
statistical coefficients are given the same name when they are used
for purely descriptive purposes, as when corresponding coefficients
are used to measure the force or the precision of an induction. The
term ‘probable error,’ for example, is used both for the purpose of
supplementing and improving a statistical description, and for the
purpose of indicating the precision of some generalisation. The term
‘correlation’ itself is used both to describe an observed characteristic
of particular phenomena and in the enunciation of an inductive law
*Cf. Whitehead, Introduction to Mathematics, p. 27: “There is no more
common error than to assume that, because prolonged and accurate mathematical
calculations have been made, the application of the result to some fact of nature
is absolutely certain.”

which relates to phenomena in general.
3. I have been at pains to enforce this contrast between
statistical description and statistical induction, because the chapters
which follow are to be entirely about the latter, whereas nearly all
statistical treatises are mainly concerned with the former. My object
will be to analyse, so far as I can, the logical basis of statistical
modes of argument. This involves a double task. To mark down those
which are invalid amongst arguments having the support of authority
is relatively easy. The other branch of our investigation, namely, to
analyse the ground of validity in the case of those arguments the
force of which all of us do in fact admit, presents the same kind of
fundamental difficulties as we met with in the case of Induction.
4. The arguments with which we have to deal fall into three
main classes:
(i.) Given the probability relative to certain evidence of each
of a series of events, what are the probabilities, relative to the
same evidence, of various proportionate frequencies of occurrence for
the events over the whole series? Or more briefly, how often may
we expect an event to happen over a series of occasions, given its
probability on each occasion?
(ii.) Given the frequency with which an event has occurred on
a series of occasions, with what probability may we expect it on a
further occasion?
(iii.) Given the frequency with which an event has occurred on a
series of occasions, with what frequency may we probably expect it
on a further series of occasions?
In the first type of argument we seek to infer an unknown
statistical frequency from an à priori probability. In the second
type we are engaged on the inverse operation, and seek to base the
calculation of a probability on an observed statistical frequency. In
the third type we seek to pass from an observed statistical frequency,
not merely to the probability of an individual occurrence, but to the
probable values of other unknown statistical frequencies.
ch. xxvii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 375
Each of these types of argument can be further complicated
by being applied not simply to the occurrence of a simple event
but to the concurrence under given conditions of two or more
events. When this two or more dimensional classification replaces
the one dimensional, the theory becomes what is sometimes termed
Correlation, as distinguished from simple Statistical Frequency.
5. In Chapter XXVIII. I touch briefly on the observed phenomena
which have given rise to the so-called Law of Great Numbers, and the
discovery of which first set statistical investigation going. In Chapter
XXIX. the first type of argument, as classified above, is analysed,
and the conditions which are required for its validity are stated. The
crucial problem of attacking the second and third types of argument
is the subject of my concluding chapters.
CHAPTER XXVIII
the law of great numbers
Natura quidem suas habet consuetudines, natas ex reditu causarum, sed non
nisi ?? ?p? t? p???. Novi morbi inundant subiande humanum genus, quodsi ergo
de mortibus quotcunque experimenta feceris, non ideo naturae rerum limites
posuisti, ut pro futuro variare non possit.—Leibniz in a letter to Bernoulli,
December 3, 1703.
1. It has always been known that, while some sets of events
invariably happen together, other sets generally happen together.
That experience shows one thing, while not always a sign of another,
to be a usual or probable sign of it, must have been one of the
earliest and most primitive forms of knowledge. If a dog is generally
given scraps at table, that is sufficient for him to judge it reasonable
to be there. But this kind of knowledge was slow to be made precise.
Numerous experiments must be carefully recorded before we can know
at all accurately how usual the association is. It would take a dog a
long time to find out that he was given scraps except on fast days,
and that there was the same number of these in every year.
The necessary kind of knowledge began to be accumulated during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by the early statisticians.
Halley and others began to construct mortality tables; the proportion
of the births of each sex were tabulated; and so forth. These
investigations brought to light a new fact which had not been
suspected previously—namely, that in certain cases of partial
association the degree of association, i.e. the proportion of instances
in which it existed, shows a very surprising regularity, and that
this regularity becomes more marked the greater the number of the
instances under consideration. It was found, for example, not merely
that boys and girls are born on the whole in about equal proportions,
but that the proportion, which is not one of complete equality, tends
everywhere, when the number of recorded instances becomes large, to
376
ch. xxviii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 377
approximate towards a certain definite figure.
During the eighteenth century matters were not pushed much
further than this, that in certain cases, of which comparatively
few were known, there was this surprising regularity, increasing in
degree as the instances became more numerous. Bernoulli, however,
took the first step towards giving it a theoretical basis by showing
that, if the à priori probability is known throughout, then (subject
to certain conditions which he himself did not make clear) in the
long run a certain determinate frequency of occurrence is to be
expected. Süssmilch (Die göttliche Ordnung in den Veränderungen
des menschlichen Geschlechts, 1741) discovered a theological interest
in these regularities. Such ideas had become sufficiently familiar
for Gibbon to characterise the results of probability as “so true in
general, so fallacious in particular.” Kant found in them (as many
later writers have done) some bearing on the problem of Free Will.*
But with the nineteenth century came bolder theoretical methods
and a wider knowledge of facts. After proving his extension of
Bernoulli’s Theorem,† Poisson applied it to the observed facts, and
gave to the principle underlying these regularities the title of the
Law of Great Numbers. “Les choses de toutes natures,” he wrote,‡
*
In Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in weltbürgerlicher Absicht, 1784.
For a discussion of this passage and for the connection between Kant and
Süssmilch, see Lottin’s Quetelet, pp. 367, 368.
†See p. 391.
‡Recherches, pp. 7–12. Von Bortkiewicz (Kritische Betrachtungen, 1st part,
pp. 655–660) has maintained that Poisson intended to state his principle in a
less general way than that in which it has been generally taken, and that he
was misunderstood by Quetelet and others. If we attend only to Poisson’s
contributions to Comptes Rendus in 1835 and 1836 and to the examples he
gives there, it is possible to make out a good case for thinking that he intended
his law to extend only to cases where certain strict conditions were fulfilled.
But this is not the spirit of his more popular writings or of the passage
quoted above. At any rate, it is the fashion, in which Poisson influenced
his contemporaries, that is historically interesting; and this is certainly not
represented by Von Bortkiewicz’s interpretation.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 378
“sont soumises à une loi universelle qu’on peut appeler la loi des
grands nombres. . . . De ces exemples de toutes natures, il résulte
que la loi universelle des grands nombres est déjà pour nous un fait
général et incontestable, résultant d’expériences qui ne se démentent
jamais.” This is the language of exaggeration; it is also extremely
vague. But it is exciting; it seems to open up a whole new field to
scientific investigation; and it has had a great influence on subsequent
thought. Poisson seems to claim that, in the whole field of chance and
variable occurrence, there really exists, amidst the apparent disorder,
a discoverable system. Constant causes are always at work and
assert themselves in the long run, so that each class of event does
eventually occur in a definite proportion of cases. It is not clear how
far Poisson’s result is due to à priori reasoning, and how far it is a
natural law based on experience; but it is represented as displaying a
certain harmony between natural law and the à priori reasoning of
probabilities.
Poisson’s conception was mainly popularised through the writings
of Quetelet. In 1823 Quetelet visited Paris on an astronomical errand,
where he was introduced to Laplace and came into touch with “la
grande école française.” “Ma jeunesse et mon zèle,” he wrote in later
years, “ne tardèrent pas à me mettre en rapport avec les hommes
les plus distingués de cette époque; qu’on me permette de citer
Fourier, Poisson, Lacroix, spécialement connus, comme Laplace, par
leurs excellents écrits sux la théorie mathématique des probabilités. . . .
C’est donc au milieu des savants, statisticiens, et économistes de ce
temps que j’ai commencé mes travaux.” * Shortly afterwards began his
long series of papers, extending down to 1873, on the application of
Probability to social statistics. He wrote a text-book on Probability
in the form of letters for the instruction of the Prince Consort.
Before accepting in 1815 at the age of nineteen (with a view to a
*For the details of the life of Quetelet and for a very full discussion of his
writings with special reference to Probability, see Lottin’s Quetelet, statisticien
et sociologue.
ch. xxviii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 379
livelihood) a professorship of mathematics, Quetelet had studied as
an art student and written poetry; a year later an opera, of which
he was part-author, was produced at Ghent. The character of his
scientific work is in keeping with these beginnings. There is scarcely
any permanent, accurate contribution to knowledge which can be
associated with his name. But suggestions, projects, far-reaching
ideas he could both conceive and express, and he has a very fair
claim, I think, to be regarded as the parent of modern statistical
method.
Quetelet very much increased the number of instances of the
Law of Great Numbers, and also brought into prominence a slightly
variant type of it, of which a characteristic example is the law of
height, according to which the heights of any considerable sample
taken from any population tend to group themselves according to a
certain well-known curve. His instances were chiefly drawn from social
statistics, and many of them were of a kind well calculated to strike
the imagination—the regularity of the number of suicides, “l’effrayante
exactitude avec laquelle les crimes se reproduisent,” and so forth.
Quetelet writes with an almost religious awe of these mysterious laws,
and certainly makes the mistake of treating them as being as adequate
and complete in themselves as the laws of physics, and as little needing
any further analysis or explanation.* Quetelet’s sensational language
may have given a considerable impetus to the collection of social
statistics, but it also involved statistics in a slight element of suspicion
in the minds of some who, like Comte, regarded the application of the
mathematical calculus of probability to social science as “purement
*Compare, for instance, the following passage from Recherches sur le penchant
au crime: “Il me semble que ce qui se rattache à l’espèce humaine, considérée
en masse, est de l’ordre des faits physiques; plus le nombre des individus est
grand, plus la volonté individuelle s’efface et laisse prédominer la série des faits
généraux qui dépendent des causes générales. . . . Ce sont ces causes qu’il s’agit
de saisir, et dès qu’on les connaîtra, on en déterminera les effets pour la société
comme on détermine les effets par les causes dans les sciences physiques.”
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 380
chimérique et, par conséquent, tout à fait vicieuse.” The suspicion
of quackery has not yet disappeared. Quetelet belongs, it must be
admitted, to the long line of brilliant writers, not yet extinct, who
have prevented Probability from becoming, in the scientific salon,
perfectly respectable. There is still about it for scientists a smack of
astrology, of alchemy.
The progress of the conception since the time of Quetelet has
been steady and uneventful; and long strides towards this perfect
respectability have been taken. Instances have been multiplied and
the conditions necessary for the existence of statistical stability have
been to some extent analysed. While the most fruitful applications
of these methods have still been perhaps, as at first, in social
statistics and in errors of observation, a number of uses for them
have been discovered in quite recent times in the other sciences; and
the principles of Mendelism have opened out for them a great field of
application throughout biology.
2. The existence of numerous instances of the Law of Great
Numbers, or of something of the kind, is absolutely essential for
the importance of Statistical Induction. Apart from this the more
precise parts of statistics, the collection of facts for the prediction of
future frequencies and associations, would be nearly useless. But the
‘Law of Great Numbers’ is not at all a good name for the principle
which underlies Statistical Induction. The ‘Stability of Statistical
Frequencies’ would be a much better name for it. The former suggests,
as perhaps Poisson intended to suggest, but what is certainly false,
that every class of event shows statistical regularity of occurrence if
only one takes a sufficient number of instances of it. It also encourages
the method of procedure, by which it is thought legitimate to take
any observed degree of frequency or association, which is shown in
a fairly numerous set of statistics, and to assume with insufficient
investigation that, because the statistics are numerous, the observed
degree of frequency is therefore stable. Observation shows that some
statistical frequencies are, within narrower or wider limits, stable.
ch. xxviii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 381
But stable frequencies are not very common, and cannot be assumed
lightly.
The gradual discovery, that there are certain classes of phenomena,
in which, though it is impossible to predict what will happen in each
individual case, there is nevertheless a regularity of occurrence if the
phenomena be considered together in successive sets, gives the clue to
the abstract inquiry upon which we are about to embark.
CHAPTER XXIX
the use of à priori probabilities for the
prediction of statistical frequency—the
theorems of bernoulli, poisson, and tchebycheff
Hoc igitur est illud Problema, quod evulgandum hoc loco proposui, postquam
jam per vicennium pressi, et cujus tum novitas, tum summa utilitas cum
pari conjuncta difficultate omnibus reliquis hujus doctrinae capitibus pondus et
pretium superaddere potest.—Bernoulli.
*
1. Bernoulli’s Theorem is generally regarded as the central
theorem of statistical probability. It embodies the first attempt to
deduce the measures of statistical frequencies from the measures of
individual probabilities, and it is a sufficient fruit of the twenty
years which Bernoulli alleges that he spent in reaching his result, if
out of it the conception first arose of general laws amongst masses
of phenomena, in spite of the uncertainty of each particular case.
But, as we shall see, the theorem is only valid subject to stricter
qualifications, than have always been remembered, and in conditions
which are the exception, not the rule.
The problem, to be discussed in this chapter, is as follows: Given
a series of occasions, the probability† of the occurrence of a certain
event at each of which is known relative to certain initial data h,
on what proportion of these occasions may we reasonably anticipate
the occurrence of the event? Given, that is to say, the individual
probability of each of a series of events à priori, what statistical
frequency of occurrence of these events is to be anticipated over the
whole series? Beginning with Bernoulli’s Theorem, we will consider
the various solutions of this problem which have been propounded,
*Ars Conjectandi, p. 227.
†
In the simplest cases, dealt with by Bernoulli, these probabilities are all
supposed equal.
382
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 383
and endeavour to determine the proper limits within which each
method has validity.
2. Bernoulli’s Theorem in its simplest form is as follows:
If the probability of an event’s occurrence under certain conditions
is p, then, if these conditions are present on m occasions, the most
probable number of the event’s occurrences is mp (or the nearest
integer to this), i.e. the most probable proportion of its occurrences
to the total number of occasions is p: further, the probability that
the proportion of the event’s occurrences will diverge from the most
probable proportion p by less than a given amount b, increases as
m increases, the value of this probability being calculable by a process
of approximation.
The probability of the event’s occurring n times and failing
m - n times out of the m occasions is (subject to certain conditions
to be elucidated later) p
n
q
m-n multiplied by the coefficient of this
expression in the expansion of (p + q)
m, where p + q = 1. If we
write n = mp - h, this term is m!
(mp - h)!(mq + h)!p
n
q
m-n
. It is easily
shown that this is a maximum when h = 0, i.e. when n = mp (or
the nearest integer to this, where mp is not integral). This result
constitutes the first part of Bernoulli’s Theorem.
For the second part of the theorem some method of approximation
is required. Provided that m is large, we can simplify the expression
m!
(mp - h)!(mq + h)!p
n
q
m-n by means of Stirling’s Theorem, and
obtain as its approximate value
1
v
2pmpq
e
- h
2
2mpq
As before, this is a maximum when h = 0, i.e. when n = mp.
It is possible, of course, by more complicated formulae to obtain
closer approximations than this.* But there is an objection, which
*See, e.g., Bowley, Elements of Statistics, p. 298. The objection about to be
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 384
can be raised to this approximation, quite distinct from the fact that
it does not furnish a result correct to as many places of decimals as
it might. This is, that the approximation is independent of the sign
of h, whereas the original expression is not thus independent. That
is to say, the approximation implies a symmetrical distribution for
different values of h about the value for h = 0; while the expression
under approximation is unsymmetrical. It is easily seen that this
want of symmetry is appreciable unless mpq is large. We ought,
therefore, to have laid it down as a condition of our approximation,
not only that m must be large, but also that mpq must be large.
Unlike most of my criticisms, this is a mathematical, rather than a
logical point. I recur to it in § 15.
“Par une fiction qui rendra les calculs plus faciles” (to quote
Bertrand), we now replace the integer h by a continuous variable z
and argue that the probability that the amount of the divergence
from the most probable value mp will lie between z and z + dz, is
1
v
2pmpq
e
- z
2
2mpq dz.
This ‘fiction’ will do no harm so long as it is remembered that we are
now dealing with a particular kind of approximation. The probability
that the divergence h from the most probable value mp will be less
than some given quantity a is, therefore,
1
v
2pmpq Z +a
-a
e
- z
2
2mpq dz.
If we put z

raised does not apply to these closer approximations.

Thus, if we write a =

that the number of
occurrences will lie between

series. Given the à priori probabilities, the precision varies inversely
with the square root of the number of instances. Thus, while

(e.g. Laplace, by the use of Euler’s Theorem, and more recently Czuber,
Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, vol. i. p. 121). As the whole formula is approximate,
the simpler expression given in the text is probably not less satisfactory in
practice. See also Czuber, Entwicklung, pp. 76, 77, and Eggenberger, Beiträge
zur Darstellung des Bernoullischen Theorems.

given amount a decreases, the probability that the corresponding
proportionate divergence (i.e. the absolute divergence divided by the
number of instances) will be less than a given amount b, increases, as
the number of instances increases. This completes the second part of
Bernoulli’s Theorem.
3. Bernoulli himself was not acquainted with Stirling’s theorem,
and his proof differs a good deal from the proof outlined in § 2. His
final enunciation of the theorem is as follows: If in each of a given
series of experiments there are r contingencies favourable to a given
event out of a total number of contingencies t, so that r
t
is the
probability of the event at each experiment, then, given any degree
of probability c, it is possible to make such a number of experiments
that the probability, that the proportionate number of the event’s
occurrences will lie between r + 1
t
and r - 1
t
, is greater than c.
*
4. We seem, therefore, to have proved that, if the à priori
probability of an event under certain conditions is p, the proportion
of times most probable à priori for the event’s occurrence on a series
of occasions where the conditions are satisfied is also p, and that if
the series is a long one the proportion is very unlikely to differ widely
from p. This amounts to the principle which Ellis† and Venn have
employed as the defining axiom of probability, save that if the series
is ‘long enough’ the proportion, according to them, will certainly
*Ars Conjectandi, p. 236 (I have translated freely). There is a brief account
of Bernoulli’s proof in Todhunter’s History, pp. 71, 72. The problem is dealt
with by Laplace, Théorie analytique, livre ii. chap. iii. For an account of
Laplace’s proof see Todhunter’s History, pp. 548–553.
†On the Foundation of the Theory of Probabilities: “If the probability of a
given event be correctly determined, the event will on a long run of trials tend
to recur with frequency proportional to this probability. This is generally proved
mathematically. It seems to me to be true à priori. . . . I have been unable to
sever the judgment that one event is more likely to happen than another from
the belief that in the long run it will occur more frequently.”
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 387
be p. Laplace* believed that the theorem afforded a demonstration
of a general law of nature, and in his second edition published
in 1814 he replaces†
the eloquent dedication, A Napoléon-le-Grand,
which prefaces the edition of 1812, by an explanation that Bernoulli’s
Theorem must always bring about the eventual downfall of a great
power which, drunk with the love of conquest, aspires to a universal
domination,—“c’est encore un résultat du calcul des probabilités,
confirmé par de nombreuses et funestes expériences.”
5. Such is the famous Theorem of Bernoulli which some
have believed‡
to have a universal validity and to be applicable
to all ‘properly calculated’ probabilities. Yet the theorem exhibits
algebraical rather than logical insight. And, for reasons about to be
given, it will have to be conceded that it is only true of a special
class of cases and requires conditions, before it can be legitimately
applied, of which the fulfilment is rather the exception than the rule.
For consider the case of a coin of which it is given that the two faces
are either both heads or both tails: at every toss, provided that the
results of the other tosses are unknown, the probability of heads is 1
2
and the probability of tails is 1
2
; yet the probability of m heads and
m tails in 2m tosses is zero, and it is certain à priori that there
will be either 2m heads or none. Clearly Bernoulli’s Theorem is
inapplicable to such a case. And this is but an extreme case of a
normal condition.
For the first stage in the proof of the theorem assumes that, if p is
the probability of one occurrence, p
r
is the probability of r occurrences
*Essai philosophique, p. 53: “On peut tirer du théorème précédent cette

sont considérés en grand nombre.”

‡Even by Mr. Bradley, Principles of Logic, p. 214. After criticising Venn’s
view he adds: “It is false that the chances must be realised in a series. It
is, however, true that they most probably will be, and true again that this
probability is increased, the greater the length we give to our series.”
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 388
running. Our discussion of the theorems of multiplication will have
shown how considerable an assumption this involves. It assumes
that a knowledge of the fact that the event has occurred on every
one of the first r - 1 occasions does not in any degree affect the
probability of its occurrence on the rth. Thus Bernoulli’s Theorem is
only valid if our initial data are of such a character that additional
knowledge, as to the proportion of failures and successes in one part
of a series of cases is altogether irrelevant to our expectation as to
the proportion in another part. If, for example, the initial probability
of the occurrence of an event under certain circumstances is one in
a million, we may only apply Bernoulli’s Theorem to evaluate our
expectation over a million trials, if our original data are of such a
character that, even after the occurrence of the event in every one of
the first million trials, the probability in the light of this additional
knowledge that the event will occur on the next occasion is still no
more than one in a million.
Such a condition is very seldom fulfilled. If our initial probability
is partly founded upon experience, it is clear that it is liable to
modification in the light of further experience. It is, in fact, difficult
to give a concrete instance of a case in which the conditions for the
application of Bernoulli’s Theorem are completely fulfilled. At the
best we are dealing in practice with a good approximation, and can
assert that no realised series of moderate length can much affect our
initial probability. If we wish to employ the expression 2
v

we are in a worse position. For this is an approximate formula
which requires for its validity that the series should be long; whilst
it is precisely in this event, as we have seen above, that the use of
Bernoulli’s Theorem is more than usually likely to be illegitimate.
6. The conditions, which have been described above, can be
expressed precisely as follows:
Let mxn represent the statement that the event has occurred
on m out of n occasions and has not occurred on the others; and
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 389
let 1x1/h = p, where h represents our à priori data, so that p
is the à priori probability of the event in question. Bernoulli’s
Theorem then requires a series of conditions, of which the following
is typical: m+1xn+1/mxn  h =1 x1/h, i.e. the probability of the event
on the n + 1th occasion must be unaffected by our knowledge of its
proportionate frequency on the first n occasions, and must be exactly
equal to its à priori probability before the first occasion.
Let us select one of these conditions for closer consideration. If
yr represents the statement that the event has occurred on each of
r successive occasions, yr/h = yr/yr-1h  yr-1/h and so on, so that
yr/h =

Bernoulli’s Theorem, that is to say, tends, if it is carelessly applied,
to exaggerate the rate at which the probability of a given divergence
from the most probable decreases as the divergence increases. If
we are given a penny of which we have no reason to doubt the
regularity, the probability of heads at the first toss is 1
2
; but if heads
fall at every one of the first 999 tosses, it becomes reasonable to
estimate the probability of heads at the thousandth toss at much
more than 1
2
. For the à priori probability of its being a conjurer’s
penny, or otherwise biassed so as to fall heads almost invariably, is
not usually so infinitesimally small as (
1
2
)
1000. We can only apply
Bernoulli’s Theorem with rigour for a prediction as to the penny’s
behaviour over a series of a thousand tosses, if we have à priori such
exhaustive knowledge of the penny’s constitution and of the other
conditions of the problem that 999 heads running would not cause us
to modify in any respect our prediction à priori.
7. It seldom happens, therefore, that we can apply Bernoulli’s
Theorem with reference to a long series of natural events. For in such
cases we seldom possess the exhaustive knowledge which is necessary.
Even where the series is short, the perfectly rigorous application
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 390
of the Theorem is not likely to be legitimate, and some degree of
approximation will be involved in utilising its results.
Not so infrequently, however, artificial series can be devised
in which the assumptions of Bernoulli’s Theorem are relatively
legitimate.* Given, that is to say, a proposition a1, some series
a1a2 . . . can be found, which satisfies the conditions:
(i.) a1/h = a2/h . . . = ar/h.
(ii.) ar/as . . . a¯t
. . . h = ar/h.
Adherents of the Frequency Theory of Probability, who use the
principal conclusion of Bernoulli’s Theorem as the defining property
of all probabilities, sometimes seem to mean no more than that,
relative to given evidence, every proposition belongs to some series,
to the members of which Bernoulli’s Theorem is rigorously applicable.
But the natural series, the series, for example, in which we are most
often interested, where the a’s are alike in being accompanied by
certain specified conditions c, is not, as a rule, rigorously subject to
the Theorem. Thus ‘the probability of a in certain conditions c is 1
2
’
is not in general equivalent, as has sometimes been supposed, to ‘It
is 500 to 1 that in 40, 000 occurrences of c, a will not occur more
than 20, 200 times, and 500 to 1 that it will not occur less than
19, 800 times.’
8. Bernoulli’s Theorem supplies the simplest formula by which
we can attempt to pass from the à priori probabilities of each of a
series of events to a prediction of the statistical frequency of their
occurrence over the whole series. We have seen that Bernoulli’s
Theorem involves two assumptions, one (in the form in which it is
usually enunciated) tacit and the other explicit. It is assumed, first,
that a knowledge of what has occurred at some of the trials would
*
In the discussion in Chapter XVI., p. 195, of the probability of a divergence
from an equality of heads and tails in coin-tossing, an example has been given
of the construction of an artificial series in which the application of Bernoulli’s
Theorem is more legitimate than in the natural series.
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 391
not affect the probability of what may occur at any of the others; and
it is assumed, secondly, that these probabilities are all equal à priori.
It is assumed, that is to say, that the probability of the event’s
occurrence at the rth trial is equal à priori to its probability at the
nth trial, and, further, that it is unaffected by a knowledge of what
may actually have occurred at the nth trial.
A formula, which dispenses with the explicit assumption of equal
à priori probabilities at every trial, was proposed by Poisson,* and
is usually known by his name. It does not dispense, however, with
the other inexplicit assumption. The difference between Poisson’s
Theorem and Bernoulli’s is best shown by reference to the ideal
case of balls drawn from an urn. The typical example for the valid
application of Bernoulli’s Theorem is that of balls drawn from a
single urn, containing black and white balls in a known proportion,
and replaced after each drawing, or of balls drawn from a series
of urns, each containing black and white balls in the same known
proportion. The typical example for Poisson’s Theorem is that of
balls drawn from a series of urns, each containing black and white
balls in different known proportions.
Poisson’s Theorem may be enunciated as follows:† Let s trials be
made, and at the ?th trial (? = 1, 2 . . . s) let the probabilities for the
occurrence and non-occurrence of the event be p?, q? respectively.
Then, if

9. This is a highly ingenious theorem and extends the application
of Bernoulli’s results to some important types of cases. It embraces,
for example, the case in which the successive terms of a series are
drawn from distinct populations known to be characterised by differing
statistical frequencies; no further complication being necessary beyond
the calculation of two simple functions of these frequencies and of the
number of terms in the series. But it is important not to exaggerate
the degree to which Poisson’s method has extended the application
of Bernoulli’s results. Poisson’s Theorem leaves untouched all those
cases in which the probabilities of some of the terms in the series of
events can be influenced by a knowledge of how some of the other
terms in the series have turned out.
Amongst these cases two types can be distinguished. In the
first type such knowledge would lead us to discriminate between
the conditions to which the different instances are subject. If, for
example, balls are drawn from a bag, containing black and white
balls in known proportions, and not replaced, the knowledge whether
or not the first ball drawn was black affects the probability of the
second ball’s being black because it tells us how the conditions in
which the second ball is drawn differ from those in which the first ball
was drawn. In the second type such knowledge does not lead us to
discriminate between the conditions to which the different instances
are subject, but it leads us to modify our opinion as to the nature
*For the analogous form of Bernoulli’s Theorem see p. 385 (footnote).
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 393
of the conditions which apply to all the terms alike. If, for instance,
balls are drawn from a bag, which is one, but it is not certainly
known which, out of a number of bags containing black and white
balls in differing proportions, the knowledge of the colour of the first
ball drawn affects the probabilities at the second drawing, because it
throws some light upon the question as to which bag is being drawn
from.
This last type is that to which most instances conform which are
drawn from the real world. A knowledge of the characteristics of some
members of a population may give us a clue to the general character
of the population in question. Yet it is this type, where there is a
change in knowledge but no change in the material conditions from
one instance to the next, which is most frequently overlooked.*
It
will be worth while to say something further about each of these two
*Numerous instances could be quoted. To take a recent English example,
reference may be made to Yule, Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, p. 251.
Mr. Yule thinks that the condition of independence is satisfied if “the result
of any one throw or toss does not affect, and is unaffected by, the results
of the preceding and following tosses,” and does not allow for the cases in
which knowledge of the result is relevant apart from any change in the physical
conditions.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 394
types.*
10. For problems of the first type, where there is physical or
material dependence between the successive trials, it is not possible, I
think, to propose any general solution; since the probabilities of the
successive trials may be modified in all kinds of different ways. But
for particular problems, if the conditions are precise enough, solutions
can be devised. The problem, for instance, of an urn, containing black
and white balls in known proportions, from which balls are drawn
successively and not replaced,
†
is ingeniously solved by Czuber‡ with
the aid of Stirling’s Theorem. If s is the number of balls and s the
number of drawings, he reaches the interesting conclusion (assuming
that s, s and s -s are all large) that the probability of the number of
black balls lying within given limits is the same as it would be if the
balls were replaced after each drawing and the number of drawings
were
s - s
s
s instead of s.
In addition to the assumptions already stated, Professor Czuber’s
solution applies only to those cases where the limits, for which we
wish to determine the probability, are narrow compared with the
*The types which I distinguish under four heads (the Bernoullian, the
Poissonian, and the two described above) Bachelier (Calcul des probabilités,
p. 155) classifies as follows:
(i.) When the conditions are identical throughout, the problem has uniformité;
(ii.) When they vary from stage to stage, but according to a law given from
the beginning and in a manner which does not depend upon what has happened
at the earlier stages, it has indépendance;
(iii.) When they vary in a manner which depends upon what has happened
at the earlier stages, it has connexité.
Bachelier gives solutions for each type on the assumption that the number
of trials is very great, and that the number of successes or failures can be
regarded as a continuous variable. This is the same kind of assumption as that
made in the proof of Bernoulli’s Theorem given in § 2, and is open to the same
objections,—or rather the value of the results is limited in the same way.
†
It is of no consequence whether the balls are drawn successively and not
replaced, or are drawn simultaneously.

total number of black balls ps. Professor Pearson* has worked out
the same problem in a much more general manner, so as to deal
with the whole range, i.e. the frequency or probability of all possible
ratios of black balls, even where s > ps. The various forms of curve,
which result, according to the different relations existing between p, s,
and s, supply examples of each of the different types of frequency
curve which arise out of a classification according to (i.) skewness or
symmetry, (ii.) limitation of range in one, both or neither direction;
and he designates, therefore, the curves which are thus obtained as
generalised probability curves. His discussion of the properties of these
curves is interesting, however, to the student of descriptive statistics
rather than to the student of probability. The most generalised and,
mathematically, by far the most elegant treatment of this problem,
with which I am acquainted, is due to Professor Tschuprow.†
Poisson, in attempting a somewhat similar problem,‡ arrives at a
result, which seems obviously contrary to good sense, by a curious,
but characteristic, misapprehension of the meaning of ‘independence’
in probability. His problem is as follows: If l balls be taken out from
an urn, containing c black and white balls in known proportions, and
not replaced, and if a further number of balls µ be then taken out,
the probability that a given proportion m
m + n
of these µ balls will
be black is independent of the number and the colour of the l balls
originally drawn out. For, he argues, if l + µ balls are drawn out,
the probability of a combination, which is made up of l black and
white balls in given proportions followed by µ balls, of which m are
white and n black, must be the same as that of a similar combination
in which the µ balls precede the l balls. Hence the probability of
m white balls in µ drawings, given that the l balls have already been
drawn out, must be equal to the probability of the same result, when

no balls have been previously drawn out. The reader will perceive
that Poisson, thinking only of physical dependence, has been led to
his paradoxical conclusion by a failure to distinguish between the
cases where the proportion of black and white balls amongst the
l balls originally drawn is known and where it is not. The fact of
their having been drawn in certain proportions, provided that only
the total number drawn is known and the proportions are unknown,
does not influence the probability. Poisson states in his conclusion
that the probability is independent of the number and colour of the
l balls originally drawn. If he had added—as he ought—‘provided the
number of each colour is unknown,’ the air of paradox disappears.
This is an exceedingly good example of the failure to perceive that
a probability cannot be influenced by the occurrence of a material
event but only by such knowledge, as we may have, respecting the
occurrence of the event.*
11. For problems of the second type, where knowledge of the
result of one trial is capable of influencing the probability at the next
apart from any change in the material conditions, there is, likewise,
no general solution. The following artificial example, however, will
illustrate the sort of considerations which are involved.
In the cases where Bernoulli’s Theorem is applied to practical
questions, the à priori probability is generally obtained empirically
by reference to the statistical frequency of each alternative in past
experience under apparently similar conditions. Thus the à priori
*For an attempt to solve other problems of this type see Bachelier, Calcul
des probabilités, chap. ix. (Probabilités connexes). I think, however, that the
solutions of this chapter are vitiated by his assuming in the course of them
both that certain quantities are very large, and also, at a later stage, that the
same quantities are infinitesimal. On this account, for example, his solution of
the following difficult problem breaks down: Given an urn A with m white and
n black balls and an urn B with m0 white and n
0 black balls, if at each move
a ball is taken from A and put into B, and at the same time a ball is taken
from B and put into A, what is the probability after x moves that the urns
A and B shall have a given composition?
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 397
probability of a male birth is estimated by reference to the recorded
proportion of male births in the past.* The validity of estimating
probabilities in this manner will be discussed later. But for the
purposes of this example let us assume that the à priori probability
has been calculated on this basis. Thus the à priori probability
p

=
r
s

of an event is based on the observation of its occurrence
r times out of s occasions on which the given conditions were
present. Now, according to Bernoulli’s Theorem directly applied, the
probability of the event’s occurring n times running is p
n or r
s
n
.
But, if the event occurs at the first trial, the probability at the
second becomes r + 1
s + 1
, and so on. Hence the probability P, properly
calculated, of n successive occurrences is
r
s

r + 1
s + 1

r + 2
s + 2
. . .
r + n - 1
s + n - 1
.
*Cf. Yule, Theory of Statistics, p. 258: “We are not able to assign an à priori
value to the chance p (i.e. of a male birth) as in the case of dice-throwing, but
it is quite sufficiently accurate for practical purposes to use the proportion of
male births actually observed if that proportion be based on a moderately large
number of observations.”

Thus, in this case, the assumption of Bernoulli’s Theorem is
approximately correct, only if Q is nearly unity. This condition is
not satisfied unless n is small both compared with r and compared
with s. It is very important to notice that two conditions are involved.
Not only must the experience, upon which the à priori probability
is based, be extensive in comparison with the number of instances
to which we apply our prediction; but also the number of previous
instances multiplied by the probability based upon them, i.e. sp (= r),
must be large in comparison with the number of new instances. Thus,
even where the prior experience, upon which we found the initial
probability P, is very extensive, we must not, if P is very small, say
that the probability of n successive occurrences is approximately p
n
,
unless n is also small. Similarly if we wish to determine, by the
methods of Bernoulli, the probability of n occurrences and m failures
on m+n occasions, it is necessary that we should have m and n small
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 399
compared with s, n small compared with r, and m small compared
with s - r.
*
The case solved above is the simplest possible. The general
problem is as follows: If an event has occurred x times in the first
y trials, its probability at the y + 1th is r + x
s + y
; determine the à priori
probability of the event’s occurring p times in q trials. If the à priori
probability in question is represented by f(p, q), we have
f(p, q) = r + p - 1
s + q - 1
f(p - 1, q - 1) + s + q - 1 - r - p
s + q - 1
f(p, q - 1).
I know of no solution of this, even approximate. But we may say that
the conditions are those of supernormal dispersion as compared with
Bernoulli’s conditions. That is to say, the probability of a proportion
differing widely from r
s
is greater than in Bernoullian conditions;
for when the proportion begins to diverge it becomes more probable
that it will continue to diverge in the same direction. If, on the
other hand, the conditions of the problem had been such, that when
the proportion begins to diverge it becomes more probable that it
will recover itself and tend back towards r
s
(as when we draw balls
without replacing them from a bag of known composition), we should
have subnormal dispersion.†
12. The condition elucidated in the preceding paragraph is
frequently overlooked by statisticians. The following example from
Czuber‡ will be sufficient for the purpose of illustration. Czuber’s
*This paragraph is concerned with a different point from that dealt with
in Professor Pearson’s article “On the Influence of Past Experience on Future
Expectation,” to which it bears a superficial resemblance. Professor Pearson’s
article which deals, not with Bernoulli’s Theorem, but with Laplace’s “Rule of
Succession,” will be referred to in § 16 of this chapter and in § 12 of the next.
†Bachelier (Calcul des probabilités, p. 201) classifies these two kinds of
conditions as conditions accélératrices and conditions retardatrices.
‡Loc. cit. vol. ii. p. 15. I choose my example from Professor Czuber because
he is usually so careful an exponent of theoretical statistics.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 400
argument is as follows:
In the period 1866–1877 there were registered in Austria
m = 4, 311, 076 male births
n = 4, 052, 193 female births
s = 8, 363, 269 ;
for the succeeding period, 1877–1899, we are given only
m0 = 6, 533, 961 male births;
what conclusion can we draw as to the number n
0 of female births?
We can conclude, according to Czuber, that the most probable value
n
0
0 =
nm0
m
= 6, 141, 587,
and that there is a probability P = .9999779 that n
0 will lie between
the limits 6, 118, 361 and 6, 164, 813.
It seems in plain opposition to good sense that on such evidence we
should be able with practical certainty 
P = .9999779 = 1 -
1
45250
to estimate the number of female births within such narrow limits.
And we see that the conditions laid down in § 11 have been flagrantly
neglected. The number of cases, over which the prediction based
on Bernoulli’s Theorem is to extend, actually exceeds the number of
cases upon which the à priori probability has been based. It may be
added that for the period, 1877–1894, the actual value of n
0 did lie
between the estimated limits, but that for the period, 1895–1905, it
lay outside limits to which the same method had attributed practical
certainty.
That Professor Czuber should have thought his own argument
plausible, is to be explained, I think, by his tacitly taking account in
his own mind of evidence not stated in the problem. He was relying
upon the fact that there is a great mass of evidence for believing that
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 401
the ratio of male to female births is peculiarly stable. But he has not
brought this into the argument, and he has not used as his à priori
probability and as his coefficient of dispersion the values which the
whole mass of this evidence would have led him to adopt. Would
not the argument have seemed very preposterous if m had been the
number of males called George, and n the number of females called
Mary? Would it not have seemed rather preposterous if m had been
the number of legitimate births and n the number of illegitimate
births? Clearly we must take account of other considerations than
the mere numerical values of m and n in estimating our à priori
probability. But this question belongs to the subject-matter of later
chapters, and, quite apart from the manner of calculation of the
à priori probability, the argument is invalidated by the fact than
an à priori probability founded on 8, 363, 269 instances, without
corroborative evidence of a non-statistical character, cannot be
assumed stable through a calculation which extends over 12, 700, 000
instances.
13. Before we leave the theorems of Bernoulli and Poisson,
it is necessary to call attention to a very remarkable theorem by
Tchebycheff, from which both of the above theorems can be derived
as special cases. This result is reached rigorously and without
approximation, by means of simple algebra and without the aid of
the differential calculus. Apart from the beauty and simplicity of the
proof, the theorem is so valuable and so little known that it will be
worth while to quote it in full:*
*From Journ. Liouville (2), xii., 1867, “Des valeurs moyennes,” an article
translated from the Russian of Tchebycheff. This proof is also quoted by
Czuber, loc. cit. p. 212, through whom I first became acquainted with it. Most
of Tchebycheff’s work was published previous to 1870 and appeared originally
in Russian. It was not easily accessible, therefore, until the publication at
Petrograd in 1907 of the collected edition of his works in French. His theorems
are, consequently, not nearly so well known as they deserve to be, although his
most important theorems were reproduced from time to time in the Journals of
Euler and Liouville. For full references see the Bibliography.

It is also easy to show* as a deduction from Tchebycheff’s Theorem
that, if an amount A is won when an event of probability p [p = 1 - q]
occurs and an amount B lost when it fails, then in s trials the
probability that the total winnings (or losses) will lie between the
limits
s(pA - qB) ± a(A + B)v

is greater than 1 -

14. From this very general result for the probable limits of
a sum composed of a number of independently varying magnitudes,
Bernoulli’s Theorem is easily derived. For let there be s observations
or trials, and s magnitudes x1x2 . . . xs corresponding, such that x = 1
when the event under consideration occurs, and x = 0 when it fails.
If the probability of the events occurrence is p, we have a = p, b = p,
etc., and a1 = p, b1 = p, etc. Hence the probability P that the number
of the event’s occurrences will lie between the limits sp±a
p
sp - sp2
,
i.e. between the limits sp ± a
vspq where q = 1 - p, is > 1 -

we compare this formula with the formula for Bernoulli’s Theorem
already given, we find that, where this formula gives P > 1 -

Thus when the limits are narrow and a is small, Bernoulli’s formula
gives a value of P very much in excess of 1 -

. But Bernoulli’s
formula involves a process of approximation which is only valid when
s is large. Tchebycheff’s formula involves no such process and is
equally valid for all values of s. We have seen in § 11 that there
are numerous cases in which for a different reason Bernoulli’s formula
exaggerates the results, and, therefore, Tchebycheff’s more cautious
limits may sometimes prove useful.
The deduction of a corresponding form of Poisson’s Theorem from
Tchebycheff’s general formula obviously follows on similar lines. For
we put* a = p1, b = p2, etc., and a1 = p1, b1 = p2, etc., and find that

In Crelle’s Journal * Tchebycheff proves Poisson’s Theorem directly
by a method similar to his general method, and also obtains several
supplementary results such as the following:

15. Tchebycheff’s methods have been set out and his results
admirably extended by A. A. Markoff.* And some developments along
the same lines by Tschuprow (“Zur Theorie der Stabilität statistischer
Reihen,” Skandinavisk Aktuarietidskrift, 1919) have convinced me that
Tchebycheff’s discovery is far more than a technical device for solving
a special problem, and points the way to the fundamental method for
attacking these questions on the mathematical side. The Laplacian
mathematics, although it still holds the field in most text-books, is
really obsolete, and ought to be replaced by the very beautiful work
which we owe to these three Russians.
16. There is one other investigation relating to Bernoulli’s
Theorem which deserves remark. I have already pointed out, in
§ 2, that the dispersion about the most probable value, even when
the conditions for the applicability of Bernoulli’s Theorem in its
non-approximate form are strictly fulfilled, is unsymmetrical. The
fact, that the usual approximation for the probability of a divergence h
from the most probable number of occurrences (the notation is that of
§ 2 above) takes the form 1
v
2pmpq
e
- h
2
2mpq , which is the same for +h
as for -h, has led to this want of symmetry being very generally
overlooked; and it is not uncommon to assume that the probability
of a given divergence less than pm is equal to that of the same
divergence in excess of pm, and, in general, that the probability of
the frequency’s exceeding pm in a set of m trials is equal to that of
its falling short of pm.
That this is not strictly the case is obvious. If a die is cast
60 times, the most probable number of appearances of the ace is 10;
but the ace is more likely to appear 9 times than 11 times; and
*The reader is referred to Markoff’s Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, and
particularly to p. 67, for a striking development, along mathematical lines, of
Tchebycheff’s leading idea. Further references to later memôirs, which, being in
the Russian language, are inaccessible to me, will be found in the Bibliography.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 408
much more likely (about 5 times as likely) not to appear at all than
to appear exactly 20 times. That this must be so will be clear to
the reader (without his requiring to trouble himself with the algebra),
when he reflects that the ace cannot appear less often than not at all,
whereas it may well appear more than 20 times, so that the smallness
of the possible divergence in defect from the most probable value 10,
as compared with the possible divergence in excess, must be made
up for by the greater frequency of any given defection as compared
with the corresponding excess. Thus the actual frequency in a series
of trials of an event, of which the probability at each trial is less
than 1
2
, is likely to fall short of its most probable value more often
than it exceeds it. What is in fact true is that the mathematical
expectation of deficiency is equal to the mathematical expectation of
excess, i.e. that the sum of the possible deficiencies each multiplied
by its probability is equal to the sum of the possible excesses each
multiplied by its probability.
The actual measurement of this want of symmetry and the
determination of the conditions, in which it can be safely neglected,
involves laborious mathematics, of which I am only acquainted with
one direct investigation, that published in the Proceedings of the
London Mathematical Society by Mr. T. C. Simmons.*
For the details of the proof I must refer the reader to
*
“A New Theorem in Probability.” Mr. Simmons claimed novelty for
his investigation, and so far as I know this claim is justified; but recent
investigations obtaining closer approximations to Bernoulli’s Theorem by means
of the Method of Moments are essentially directed towards the same problem.
A somewhat analogous point has, however, been raised by Professor Pearson
in his article (Phil. Mag., 1907) on “The Influence of Past Experience on
Future Expectation.” He brings out an exactly similar want of symmetry in
the probabilities of the various possible frequencies about the most probable
frequency, when the calculation is based, not on Bernoulli’s Theorem as in
Mr. Simmons’s investigation, but on Laplace’s rule of succession (see next
chapter). The want of symmetry has also been pointed out by Professor Lexis
(Abhandlungen, p. 120).

Mr. Simmons’s article. His principal theorem*
is as follows: If
1
a + 1
is the probability of the event at each trial and n(a + 1) the
number of trials, n and a being integers,†
the probability that the
frequency of occurrence will fall short of n is always greater than
the probability that it will exceed n; the difference between the two
probabilities being a maximum when n = 1, constantly diminishing
as n increases, lying always between 1

that it can be removed.

Thus unless not only m but mp also is large the want of symmetry
is likely to be appreciable. Thus it is easily found that in 100 sets of
4 trials each, where p =
1
4
, the actual frequency is likely to exceed
the most probable 26 times and to fall short of it 31 times; and in
100 sets of 10 trials each, where p =
1
10
, to exceed 26 times and to
fall short 34 times.
Mr. Simmons was first directed to this investigation through
noticing in the examination of sets of random digits that “each digit
presented itself, with unexpected frequency, less than 1
10
of the
number of times. For instance, in 100 sets of 150 digits each, I
found that a digit presented itself in a set more frequently under
15 times than over 15 times; similarly in the case of 80 sets each of
250 digits, and also in other aggregations.” Its possible bearing on
such experiments with dice and roulette, as are described at the end
of this chapter, is clear. But apart from these artificial experiments,
it is sometimes worth the statistician’s while to bear in mind this
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 411
appreciable want of symmetry in the distribution about the mode or
most probable value in many even of those cases in which Bernoullian
conditions are strictly fulfilled.
17. I will conclude this chapter by an account of some of the
attempts which have been made to verify à posteriori the conclusions
of Bernoulli’s Theorem. These attempts are nearly useless, first,
because we can seldom be certain à priori that the conditions
assumed in Bernoulli’s Theorem are fulfilled, and, secondly, because
the theorem predicts not what will happen but only what is, on
certain evidence, likely to happen. Thus even where our results do not
verify Bernoulli’s Theorem, the theorem is not thereby discredited.
The results have bearing on the conditions in which the experiments
took place, rather than upon the truth of the theorem. In spite,
therefore, of the not unimportant place which these attempts have in
the history of probability, their scientific value is very small. I record
them, because they have a good deal of historical and psychological
interest, and because they satisfy a certain idle curiosity from which
few students of probability are altogether free.*
18. The data for these investigations have been principally
drawn from four sources—coin-tossing, the throw of dice, lotteries,
and roulette; for in such cases as these the conditions for Bernoulli’s
Theorem seem to be fulfilled most nearly. The earliest recorded
experiment was carried out by Buffon,† who, assisted by a child
tossing a coin into the air, played 2048 partis of the Petersburg game,
in which a coin is thrown successively until the parti is brought
to an end by the appearance of heads. The same experiment was
repeated by a young pupil of De Morgan’s ‘for his own satisfaction.’‡
*Mr. Yule (Introduction to Statistics, p. 254) recommends its indulgence:
“The student is strongly recommended to carry out a few series of such
experiments personally, in order to acquire confidence in the use of the theory.”
Mr. Yule himself has indulged moderately.

been composed about 1760.
‡Formal Logic, p. 185, published 1847. De Morgan gives Buffon’s results, as
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 412
In Buffon’s trials there were 1992 tails to 2048 heads; in Mr. H.’s
(De Morgan’s pupil) 2044 tails to 2048 heads. A further experiment,
due to Buffon’s example, was carried out by Quetelet*
in 1837. He
drew 4096 balls from an urn, replacing them each time, and recorded
the result at different stages, in order to show that the precision of
the result tended to increase with the number of the experiments.
He drew altogether 2066 white balls and 2030 black balls. Following
in this same tradition is the experiment of Jevons,† who made 2048
throws of ten coins at a time, recording the proportion of heads at
each throw and the proportion of heads altogether. In the whole
number of 20, 480 single throws, he obtained heads 10, 353 times;
More recently Weldon‡
threw twelve dice 4096 times, recording the
proportion of dice at each throw which showed a number greater than
three.
All these experiments, however, are thrown completely into
the shade by the enormously extensive investigations of the Swiss
astronomer Wolf, the earliest of which were published in 1850 and the
latest in 1893.§
In his first set of experiments Wolf completed 1000
sets of tosses with two dice, each set continuing until every one of the
21 possible combinations had occurred at least once. This involved
altogether 97, 899 tosses, and he then completed a total of 100, 000.
These data enabled him to work out a great number of calculations,
of which Czuber quotes the following, namely a proportion of .83533
well as his pupil’s, in full. Buffon’s results are also investigated by Poisson,
Recherches, pp. 132–135.

of unlike pairs, as against the theoretical value .83333, i.e.
5
6
. In
his second set of experiments Wolf used two dice, one white and one
red (in the first set the dice were indistinguishable), and completed
20, 000 tosses, the details of each result being recorded in the
Vierteljahrsschrift der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Zürich. He
studied particularly the number of sequences with each die, and the
relative frequency of each of the 36 possible combinations of the two
dice. The sequences were somewhat fewer than they ought to have
been, and the relative frequency of the different combinations very
different indeed from what theory would predict.* The explanation of
this is easily found; for the records of the relative frequency of each
face show that the dice must have been very irregular, the six face
of the white die, for example, falling 38 per cent more often than
the four face of the same die. This, then, is the sole conclusion of
these immensely laborious experiments,—that Wolf’s dice were very ill
made. Indeed the experiments could have had no bearing except upon
the accuracy of his dice. But ten years later Wolf embarked upon one
more series of experiments, using four distinguishable dice,—white,
yellow, red, and blue,—and tossing this set of four 10, 000 times.
Wolf recorded altogether, therefore, in the course of his life 280, 000
results of tossing individual dice. It is not clear that Wolf had
any well-defined object in view in making these records, which are
published in curious conjunction with various astronomical results,
and they afford a wonderful example of the pure love of experiment
and observation.†
19. Another series of calculations have been based upon the
*Czuber quotes the principal results (loc. cit. vol. i. pp. 149–151). The
frequencies of only 4, instead of 18, out of the 36 combinations lay within the
probable limits, and the standard deviation was 76.8 instead of 23.2.
†The latest experiment of the kind, of which I am aware, is that of Otto
Meissner (“Würfelversuche,” Zeitschrift für Math. und Phys. vol. 62 (1913),
pp. 149–156), who recorded 24 series of 180 throws each with four distinguishable
dice.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 414
ready-made data provided by the published results of lotteries and
roulette.*
Czuber† has made calculations based on the lotteries of Prague
(2854 drawings) and Brünn (2703 drawings) between the years
1754 and 1886, in which the actual results agree very well with
theoretical predictions. Fechner‡
employed the lists of the ten State
lotteries of Saxony between the years 1843 and 1852. Of a rather
*For the publication of such returns there has always been a sufficient
demand on the part of gamblers. An Almanach romain sur la loterie royale
de France was published at Paris in 1830, which contained all the drawings
of the French lottery (two or three a month) from 1758 to 1830. Players at
Monte Carlo are provided with cards and pins with which to record the results
of successive coups, and the results at the tables are regularly published in Le
Monaco. Gamblers study these returns on account of the belief, which they
usually hold, that as the number of cases is increased the absolute deviation
from the most probable proportion becomes less, whereas at the best Bernoulli’s
Theorem shows that the proportionate deviation decreases while the absolute
deviation increases. Cf. Houdin’s Les Tricheries des Grecs dévoilées: “In a
game of chance, the oftener the same combination has occurred in succession,
the nearer we are to the certainty that it will not recur at the next cast
or turn-up. This is the most elementary of the theories on probabilities; it
is termed the maturity of the chances.” Laplace (Essai philosophique, p. 142)
quotes an amusing instance of the same belief not drawn from the annals of
gambling: “J’ai vu des hommes désirant ardemment d’avoir un fils, n’apprendre
qu’avec peine les naissances des garçons dans le mois où ils allaient devenir
pères. S’imaginant que le rapport de ces naissances à celles des filles devait être
le même à la fin de chaque mois, ils jugaient que les garçons déjà nés rendaient
plus probables les naissances prochaines des filles.”
The literature of gambling is very extensive, but, so far as I am acquainted
with it, excessively lacking in variety, the maturity of the chances and the
martingale continually recurring in one form or another. The curious reader will
find tolerable accounts of such topics in Proctor’s Chance and Luck, and Sir
Hiram Maxim’s Monte Carlo Facts and Fallacies.

more interesting character are Professor Karl Pearson’s investigations*
into the results of Monte Carlo Roulette as recorded in Le Monaco
in the course of eight weeks. Applying Bernoulli’s Theorem, on the
hypothesis of the equiprobability of all the compartments throughout
the investigation, he found that the actually recorded proportions
of red and black were not unexpected, but that alternations and
long runs were so much in excess that, on the assumption of the
exact accuracy of the tables, the à priori odds were at least a
thousand millions to one against some of the recorded deviations.
Professor Pearson concluded, therefore, that Monte Carlo Roulette
is not objectively a game of chance in the sense that the tables on
which it is played are absolutely devoid of bias. Here also, as in the
case of Wolf’s dice, the conclusion is solely relevant, not to the theory
or philosophy of Chance, but to the material shapes of the tools of
the experiment.
Professor Pearson’s investigations into Roulette, which dealt with
33, 000 Monte Carlo coups, have been overshadowed, just as all other
tosses of coins and dice have been outdone by Wolf, by Dr. Karl
Marbe,† who has examined 80, 000 coups from Monte Carlo and
elsewhere. Dr. Marbe arrived at exactly opposite conclusions; for he
claims to have shown that long runs, so far from being in excess, were
greatly in defect. Dr. Marbe introduces this experimental result in
support of his thesis that the world is so constituted that long runs
do not as a matter of fact occur in it.‡ Not merely are long runs very
*The Chances of Death, vol. i.
†Naturphilosophische Untersuchungen zur Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie.
‡Dr. Marbe’s monograph has given rise in Germany to a good deal of
discussion, not directed towards showing what a preposterous method this is for
demonstrating a natural law, but because the experimental result itself does not
really follow from the data and is due to a somewhat subtle error in Marbe’s
reasoning, by which he has been led into an incorrect calculation of the probable
proportions à priori of the various sequences. The problem is discussed by Von
Bortkiewicz, Brömse, Bruns, Grimsehl, and Grünbaum (for exact references to
these see the Bibliography), and by Lexis (Abhandlungen, pp. 222–226) and
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 416
improbable. They do not, according to him, occur at all. But we
may doubt whether roulette can tell us very much either of the laws
of logic or of the constitution of the universe.
Dr. Marbe’s main thesis is identical, as he himself recognises, with
one of the heterodox contentions of D’Alembert.* But this principle
of variety, precisely opposite to the usual principle of Induction, can
have no claim to be accepted à priori and, as a general principle,
there is no adequate evidence to support it from experience. Its
origin is to be found, perhaps, in the fact that in a certain class
of cases, especially where conscious human agency comes in, it may
contain some element of truth. The fact of an act’s having been done
in a particular way once may be a special reason for thinking that
it will not be performed on the next occasion in precisely the same
manner. Thus in many so-called random events some slight degree

of this controversy, Von Bortkiewicz has lately devoted a complete treatise (Die
Iterationen) to the mathematics of ‘runs.’ Dr. Marbe has been given far more
attention by his colleagues in Germany than he conceivably deserves.
*D’Alembert’s principal contributions to Probability are most accessible in
the volumes of his Opuscules mathématiques (1761). Works on Probability
usually contain some reference to D’Alembert, but his sceptical opinions, rejected
rather than answered by the orthodox school of Laplace, have not always
received full justice. D’Alembert has three main contentions to which in his
various papers he constantly recurs:
(1) That a probability very small mathematically is really zero;
(2) That the probabilities of two successive throws with a die are not
independent;
(3) That ‘mathematical expectation’ is not properly measured by the product
of the probability and the prize.
The first and third of these were partly advanced in explanation of the
Petersburg paradox (see p. 362). The second is connected with the first, and
was also used to support his incorrect evaluation of the probability of heads
twice running; but D’Alembert, in spite of many of his results being wrong, does
not altogether deserve the ridicule which he has suffered at the hands of writers,
who accepted without sceptical doubts the hardly less incorrect conclusions of
the orthodox theory of that time.
ch. xxix STATISTICAL INFERENCE 417
of causal and material dependence between successive occurrences
may, nevertheless, exist. In these cases ‘runs’ may be fewer and
shorter than those which we should predict, if a complete absence
of such dependence is assumed. If, for example, a pack of cards
be dealt, collected, and shuffled, to the extent that card-players do
as a rule shuffle, there may be a greater presumption against the
second hand’s being identical with the first than against any other
particular distribution. In the case of croupiers long experience
might possibly suggest some psychological generalisation,—that they
are very mechanical, giving an excess of numbers belonging to a
particular section of the wheel, or, on the other hand, that when a
croupier sees a run beginning, he tends to vary his spin more than
usual, thus bringing runs to an end sooner than he ought.* At any
rate, it is worth emphasising once more that from such experiments
as these this is the only kind of knowledge which we can hope to
obtain,—knowledge of the material construction of a die or of the
psychology of a croupier.

probable degree of regularity of habit on the part of the spinner could be
sufficient to produce regularity in the result.
CHAPTER XXX
the mathematical use of statistical frequencies
for the determination of probability à
posteriori—the methods of laplace
Utilissima est aestimatio probabilitatum, quanquam in exemplis juridicis
politicisque plerumque non tam subtili calculo opus est, quam accurata omnium
circumstantiarum enumeratione.—Leibniz.
1. In the preceding chapter we have assumed that the
probability of an event at each of a series of trials is given, and
have considered how to infer from this the probabilities of the various
possible frequencies of the event over the whole series, without
discussing in detail by what method the initial probability had been
determined. In statistical inquiries it is generally the case that this
initial probability is based, not upon the Principle of Indifference,
but upon the statistical frequencies of similar events which have been
observed previously. In this chapter, therefore, we must commence
the complementary part of our inquiry,—namely, into the method
of deriving a measure of probability from an observed statistical
frequency.
I do not myself believe that there is any direct and simple method
by which we can make the transition from an observed numerical
frequency to a numerical measure of probability. The problem, as
I view it, is part of the general problem of founding judgments
of probability upon experience, and can only be dealt with by the
general methods of induction expounded in Part III. The nature of
the problem precludes any other method, and direct mathematical
devices can all be shown to depend upon insupportable assumptions.
In the next chapters we will consider the applicability of general
inductive methods to this problem, and in this we will endeavour to
discredit the mathematical charlatanry by which, for a hundred years
418
ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 419
past, the basis of theoretical statistics has been greatly undermined.
2. Two direct methods have been commonly employed,
theoretically inconsistent with one another, though not in every case
noticeably discrepant in practice. The first and simplest of these
may be termed the Inversion of Bernoulli’s Theorem, and the other
Laplace’s Rule of Succession.
The earliest discussion of this problem is to be found in the
Correspondence of Leibniz and Jac. Bernoulli,* and its true nature
cannot be better indicated than by some account of the manner in
which it presented itself to these very illustrious philosophers. The
problem is tentatively proposed by Bernoulli in a letter addressed
to Leibniz in the year 1703. We can determine from à priori
considerations, he points out, by how much it is more probable
that we shall throw 7 rather than 8 with two dice, but we cannot
determine by such means the probability that a young man of twenty
will outlive an old man of sixty. Yet is it not possible that we
might obtain this knowledge à posteriori from the observation of a
great number of similar couples, each consisting of an old man and
a young man? Suppose that the young man was the survivor in
1000 cases and the old man in 500 cases, might we not conclude that
the young man is twice as likely as the old man to be the survivor?
For the most ignorant persons seem to reason in this way by a sort
of natural instinct, and feel that the risk of error is diminished as
the number of observations is increased. Might not the solution tend
asymptotically to some determinate degree of probability with the
increase of observations? Nescio, Vir Amplissime, an speculationibus
istis soliditatis aliquid inesse Tibi videatur.
Leibniz’s reply goes to the root of the difficulty. The calculation of
probabilities is of the utmost value, he says, but in statistical inquiries
there is need not so much of mathematical subtlety as of a precise
statement of all the circumstances. The possible contingencies are
*For the exact references see Bibliography.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 420
too numerous to be covered by a finite number of experiments, and
exact calculation is, therefore, out of the question. Although nature
has her habits, due to the recurrence of causes, they are general, not
invariable. Yet empirical calculation, although it is inexact, may be
adequate in affairs of practice.*
Bernoulli in his answer fell back upon the analogy of balls drawn
from an urn, and maintained that without estimating each separate
contingency we might determine within narrow limits the proportion
favouring each alternative. If the true proportion were 2 : 1, we might
estimate it with moral certainty à posteriori as lying between 201 : 100
and 199 : 100. “Certus sum,” he concluded the controversy, “Tibi
placituram demonstrationem, cum publicavero.” But whether he was
impressed by the just caution of Leibniz, or whether death intercepted
him, he advances matters no further in the Ars Conjectandi. After
dealing with some of Leibniz’s objections† and seeming to promise
some mode of estimating probabilities à posteriori by an inversion
of his theorem, he proves the direct theorem only and the book is
suddenly at an end.
3. In dealing with the correspondence of Leibniz and Bernoulli,
I have not been mainly influenced by the historical interest of it. The
view of Leibniz, dwelling mainly on considerations of analogy, and
*Leibniz’s actual expressions (in a letter to Bernoulli, December 3, 1703)
are as follows: Utilissima est aestimatio probabilitatum, quanquam in exemplis
juridicis politicisque plerumque non tam subtili calculo opus est, quam
accurata omnium circumstantiarum enumeratione. Cum empirice aestimamus
probabilitates per experimenta successuum, quaeris an ea via tandem aestimatio
perfecte obtineri possit. Idque a Te repertum scribis. Difficultas in eo mihi inesse
videtur, quod contingentia seu quae infinitis pendent circumstantiis, per finita
experimenta determinari non possunt; natura quidem suas habet consuetudines,
natas ex reditu causarum, sed non nisi ?? ?p? t? p???. Novi morbi inundant
subinde humanum genus, quodsi ergo de mortibus quotcunque experimenta
feceris, non ideo naturae rerum limites posuisti, ut pro futuro variare non possit.
Etsi autem empirice non posset haberi perfecta aestimatio, non ideo minus
empirica aestimatio in praxi utilis et sufficiens foret.

ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 421
demanding “not so much mathematical subtlety as a precise statement
of all the circumstances,” is, substantially, the view which will be
supported in the following chapters. The desire of Bernoulli for an
exact formula, which would derive from the numerical frequency of
the experimental results a numerical measure of their probability,
preludes the exact formulas of later and less cautious mathematicians,
which will be examined immediately.
4. During the greater part of the eighteenth century there is
no trace, I think, of the explicit use of the Inversion of Bernoulli’s
Theorem. The investigations carried out by D’Alembert, Daniel
Bernoulli, and others relied upon the type of argument examined in
Chapter XXV. They showed, that is to say, that certain observed
series of events would have been very improbable, if we had supposed
independence between some two factors or if some occurrence had
been assumed to be as likely as not, and they inferred from this that
there was in fact a measure of dependence or that the occurrence
had probability in its favour. But they did not endeavour to pass
from the observed frequency of occurrence to an exact measure of
the probability. With the advent of Laplace more ambitious methods
took the field.
Laplace began by assuming without proof a direct inversion of
Bernoulli’s Theorem. Bernoulli’s Theorem, in the form in which
Laplace proved it, states that, if p is the probability à priori, there
is a probability P that the proportion of times m
m + n
of the event’s
occurrence in µ (= m + n) trials will lie between p ± ?

which he assumes without proof, states that, if the event is observed
to happen m times in µ trials, there is a probability P that the
probability of the event p will lie between m

. The same result is also given by
Poisson.* Thus, given the frequency of occurrence in µ trials, these
writers infer the probability of occurrence at subsequent trials within
certain limits, just as, given the à priori probability, Bernoulli’s
Theorem would enable them to predict the frequency of occurrence in
µ trials within corresponding limits.
If the number of trials is at all numerous, these limits are narrow
and the purport of the inversion of Bernoulli’s Theorem may therefore
be put briefly as follows. By the direct theorem, if p measures the
probability, p also measures the most probable value of the frequency;
by the inversion of the theorem, if m
m + n
measures the frequency,
m
m + n
also measures the most probable value of the probability.
The simplicity of the process has recommended it, since the time of
Laplace, to a great number of writers. Czuber’s argument, criticised
on p. 399, with reference to the proportions of male and female births
in Austria, is based upon an unqualified use of it. But examples
abound throughout the literature of the subject, in which the theorem
is employed in circumstances of greater or less validity.
The theorem was originally given without proof, and is indeed
*For an account of the treatments of this topic both by Laplace and by
Poisson, see Todhunter’s History, pp. 554–557. Both of them also obtain a
formula slightly different from that given above by a method analogous to the
first part of the proof of Laplace’s Rule of Succession; i.e. by an application
of the inverse principle of probability to the assumption that the probability
of the probability’s lying within any interval is proportional to the length
of the interval. This discrepancy has given rise to some discussion. See
Todhunter, loc. cit.; De Morgan, On a Question in the Theory of Probabilities;
Monro, On the Inversion of Bernoulli’s Theorem in Probabilities ; and Czuber,
Entwicklung, pp. 83, 84. But this is not the important distinction between the
two mathematical methods by which this question has been approached, and
this minor point, which is of historical interest mainly, I forbear to enter into.
ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 423
incapable of it, unless some illegitimate assumption has been
introduced. But, apart from this, there are some obvious objections.
We have seen in the preceding chapter that Bernoulli’s Theorem itself
cannot be applied to all kinds of data indiscriminately, but only
when certain rather stringent conditions are fulfilled. Corresponding
conditions are required equally for the inversion of the theorem, and
it cannot possibly be inferred from a statement of the number of
trials and the frequency of occurrence merely, that these have been
satisfied. We must know, for instance, that the examined instances
are similar in the main relevant particulars, both to one another and
to the unexamined instances to which we intend our conclusion to be
applicable. An unanalysed statement of frequency cannot tell us this.
This method of passing from statistical frequencies to probabilities
is not, however, like the method to be discussed in a moment,
radically false. With due qualifications it has its place in the solution
of this problem. The conditions in which an inversion of Bernoulli’s
Theorem is legitimate will be elucidated in Chapter XXXI. In the
meantime we will pass on to Laplace’s second method, which is more
powerful than the first and has obtained a wider currency. The more
extreme applications of it are no longer ventured upon, but the theory
which underlies it is still widely adopted, especially by French writers
upon probability, and seldom repudiated.
5. The formula in question, which Venn* has called the Rule of
Succession, declares that, if we know no more than that an event has
occurred m times and failed n times under given conditions, then the
probability of its occurrence when those conditions are next fulfilled
is
m + 1
m + n + 2
. It is necessary, however, before we examine the proof
of this formula, to discuss in detail the reasoning which leads up to it.
This preliminary reasoning involves the Laplacian theory of
‘unknown probabilities.’ The postulate, upon which it depends,
is introduced to supplement the Principle of Indifference, and is
*Logic of Chance, p 190.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 424
in fact the extension of this principle from the probabilities of
arguments, when we know nothing about the arguments, to the
probabilities that the probabilities of arguments have certain values,
when we know nothing about the probabilities. Laplace’s enunciation
is as follows: “Quand la probabilité d’un événement simple est
inconnue, on peut lui supposer également toutes les valeurs depuis
zéro jusqu’à l’unité. La probabilité de chacune de ces hypothèses
tirée de l’événement observé est . . . une fraction dont le numérateur
est la probabilité de l’événement dans cette hypothèse, et dont le
dénominateur est la somme des probabilités semblables relatives à
toutes les hypothèses. . . .” *
Thus when the probability of an event is unknown, we may
suppose all possible values of the probability between 0 and 1 to
be equally likely à priori. The probability, after the event has
occurred, that the probability à priori was
1
r
(say), is measured by
a fraction of which 1
r
is the numerator and the sums of all the
possible à priori values the denominator. The origin of this rule
is evident. If we consider the problem in which a ball is drawn
from a bag containing an infinite number of black and white balls in
unknown proportions, we have hypotheses, corresponding to each of
the possible constitutions of the bag, the assumption of which yields
in turn every value between 0 and 1 as the à priori probability of
drawing a white ball. If we could assume that these constitutions are
equally probable à priori, we should obtain probabilities for each of
them à posteriori according to Laplace’s rule.
On the analogy of this Laplace assumes in general that, where
everything is unknown, we may suppose an infinite number of
possibilities, each of which is equally likely, and each of which leads to
the event in question with a different degree of probability, so that for
every value between 0 and 1 there is one and only one hypothetical
*Essai philosophique, p. 16.
ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 425
constitution of things, the assumption of which invests the event with
a probability of that value.
6. It might be an almost sufficient criticism of the above to point
out that these assumptions are entirely baseless. But the theory has
taken so important a place in the development of probability that it
deserves a detailed treatment.
What, in the first place, does Laplace mean by an unknown
probability? He does not mean a probability, whose value is in fact
unknown to us, because we are unable to draw conclusions which
could be drawn from the data; and he seems to apply the term to any
probability whose value, according to the argument of Chapter III.,
is numerically indeterminate. Thus he assumes that every probability
has a numerical value and that, in those cases where there seems to
be no numerical value, this value is not non-existent but unknown;
and he proceeds to argue that where the numerical value is unknown,
or as I should say where there is no such value, every value between
0 and 1 is equally probable. With the possible interpretations of
the term ‘unknown probability,’ and with the theory that every
probability can be measured by one of the real numbers between
0 and 1, I have dealt, as carefully as I can, in Chapter III. If the view
taken there is correct, Laplace’s theory breaks down immediately.
But even if we were to answer these questions, not as they have been
answered in Chapter III., but in a manner favourable to Laplace’s
theory, it remains doubtful whether we could legitimately attribute
a value to the probability of an unknown probability’s having such
and such a value. If a probability is unknown, surely the probability,
relative to the same evidence, that this probability has a given value,
is also unknown; and we are involved in an infinite regress.
7. This point leads on to the second objection; Laplace’s theory
requires the employment of both of two inconsistent methods. Let
us consider a number of alternatives a1, a2, etc., having probabilities
p1, p2, etc.; if we do not know anything about a1, we do not know
the value of its probability p1, and we must consider the various
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 426
possible values of p1, namely b1, b2, etc., the probabilities of these
possible values being q1, q2, etc. respectively. There is no reason
why this process should ever stop. For as we do not know anything
about b1, we do not know the value of its probability q1, and we
must consider the various possible values of q1 namely c1, c2, etc., the
probabilities of these possible values being r1, r2, etc., respectively;
and so on. This method consists in supposing that, when we do not
know anything about an alternative, we must consider all the possible
values of the probability of the alternative; these possible values can
form in their turn a set of alternatives, and so on. But this method
by itself can lead to no final conclusion. Laplace superimposes on
it, therefore, his other method of determining the probabilities of
alternatives about which we know nothing,—namely, the Principle of
Indifference. According to this method, when we know nothing about
a set of alternatives, we suppose the probabilities of each of them to
be equal. In some parts of his writings—and this is true also of most
of his followers—he applies this method from the beginning. If, that
is to say, we know nothing about a1, since a1 and its contradictory
form a pair of exhaustive alternatives two in number, the probability
of these alternatives is equal and each is 1
2
. But in the reasoning
which leads up to the Law of Succession he chooses to apply this
method at the second stage, having used the other method at the first
stage. If, that is to say, we know nothing about a1, its probability p1
may have any of the values b1, b2, etc. where b1 is any fraction
between 0 and 1; and, as we know nothing about the probabilities
q1, q2, etc. of these alternatives b1, b2, etc., we may by the Principle of
Indifference suppose them to be equal. This account may seem rather
confused; but it is not easy to give a lucid account of so confused a
doctrine.
8. Turning aside from these considerations, let us examine the
theory, for a moment, from another side. When we reach the Rule of
Succession, it will be seen that the hypothetical à priori probabilities
ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 427
are treated as if they were possible causes of the event. It is assumed,
that is to say, that the number of possible sets of antecedent conditions
is proportional to the number of real numbers between 0 and 1; and
that these fall into equal groups, each group corresponding to one of
the real numbers between 0 and 1, this number measuring the degree
of probability with which we could predict the event, if we knew
that an antecedent condition belonging to that group was fulfilled.
It is then assumed that all of these possible antecedent conditions
are à priori equally likely. The argument has arisen by false analogy
from the problem in which a ball is drawn from an urn containing
an infinite number of black and white balls. But for the assumption
that we have in general the kind of knowledge which is necessary
about the possible antecedents, no reasonable foundation has been
suggested.
De Morgan endeavoured to deal with the difficulty in much the
same way in the following passage:*
“In determining the chance which
exists (under known circumstances) for the happening of an event a
number of times which lies between certain limits, we are involved
in a consideration of some difficulty, namely, the probability of a
probability, or, as we have called it, the presumption of a probability.
To make this idea more clear, remember that any state of probability
may be immediately made the expression of the result of a set of
circumstances, which being introduced into the question, the difficulty
disappears. The word presumption refers distinctly to an act of
the mind, or a state of the mind, while in the word probability we
feel disposed rather to think of the external arrangements on the
knowledge of which the strength of our presumption ought to depend,
than of the presumption itself.” The point of this explanation lies
in the assumption that “any state of probability may be immediately
made the expression of the result of a set of circumstances.” It cannot
be allowed that this is generally true;† and even in those cases in
*Cabinet Encyclopaedia, p. 87.
†For instance, it is not true even in the standard instance of balls drawn
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 428
which it is true we are thrown back on the à priori probabilities of
the various sets of circumstances which need not be, as De Morgan
assumes, either equal or exhaustive alternatives.
9. The proof of the Rule of Succession, which is based upon this
theory of unknown probabilities, is, briefly, as follows:
If x stands for the à priori probability of an event in given
conditions, then the probability that the event will occur m times
and fail n times in these conditions is x
m(1 - x)
n
. If, however,
x is unknown, all values of it between 0 and 1 are à priori equally
probable. It follows from these two sets of considerations that, if the
event has been observed to occur m times out of m+n, the probability
à posteriori that x lies between x and x + dx is proportional to
x
m(1 - x)
ndx, and is equal, therefore, to Ax
m(1 - x)
ndx where A is a
constant. Since the event has in fact occurred, and since x must have
one of its possible values, A is determined by the equation
Z
0
Ax
m(1 - x)
n
dx = 1 ? A = G(m + n + 2)
G(m + 1)G(n + 1).
Hence the probability that the event will occur at the (m + n + 1)th
trial, when we know that it has occurred m times in m + n trials, is
A
Z 1
0
x
m+1(1 - x)
n
dx.
If we substitute the value of A found above, this is equal to
m + 1
m + n + 2

*
from an urn containing black and white in unknown proportions, unless the
number of balls is infinite.
*The theorem is sometimes enunciated by contemporary writers in a much
more guarded form, e.g. by Czuber, Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, vol. i. p. 197,
and by Bachelier, Calcul des probabilités, p. 487. Bachelier, instead of assuming
that the à priori probabilities of all possible values of the probability of the
event are equal, writes ?ˆ(y)dy as the à priori probability that the probability
ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 429
The class of problem to which the theorem is supposed to apply is
the following: There are certain conditions such that we are ignorant
à priori as to whether they do or do not lead to the occurrence of
a particular event; on m out of m + n occasions, however, on which
these conditions have been observed, the event has occurred; what is
the probability in the light of this experience that the event will occur
on the next occasion? The answer to all such problems is m + 1
m + n + 2
.
In the cases where n = 0, i.e. when the event has invariably occurred,
the formula yields the result m + 1
m + 2
. In the case where the conditions
have been observed once only and the event has occurred on that
occasion, the result is 2
3
. If the conditions have never been met with
at all, the probability of the event is 1
2
. And even in the case where
on the only occasion on which the conditions were observed, the event
did not occur, the probability is 1
3
.
Some of the flaws in this proof have been already explained. One
minor objection may be pointed out in addition. It is assumed that,
if x is the à priori probability of the event’s happening once, then
x
n
is the à priori probability of its happening n times in succession,
whereas by the theorem’s own showing the knowledge that the event
has happened once modifies the probability of its happening a second
time; its successive occurrences are not, therefore, independent. If
is y, so that after m occurrences in m + n trials the probability that the
probability lies between y and y + dy is
y
m(1 - y)
n?ˆ(y)dy
R
ym(1 - y)
n?ˆ(y)dy
. If one has no
idea of ?ˆ à priori, he suggests that the simplest hypothesis is to put ?ˆ = 1,
which leads, as above, to Laplace’s Law of Succession. He also proposes the
hypothesis ?ˆ(y) = a + a1y + a2y
2 + . . ., in which case the denominator is a series
of Eulerian integrals. There is a discussion of the Law of Succession, and of the
contradictions and paradoxes to which it leads, by E. T. Whittaker and others
in Part VI. vol. viii. (1920) of the Transactions of the Faculty of Actuaries in
Scotland.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 430
the à priori probability of the event is 1
2
, and if, after it has been
observed once, the probability that it will occur a second time is 2
3
,
then it follows that the à priori probability of its occurring twice is

; and in general the à priori probability
of its happening n times in succession is not 
1

n
but 1
n + 1
.
10. But refinements of disproof are hardly needed. The
principle’s conclusion is inconsistent with its premisses. We begin
with the assumption that the à priori probability of an event, about
which we have no information and no experience, is unknown, and
that all values between 0 and 1 are equally probable. We end with
the conclusion that the à priori probability of such an event is 1
2
. It
has been pointed out in § 7 that this contradiction was latent, as soon
as the Principle of Indifference was superimposed on the principle of
unknown probabilities.
The theorem’s conclusions, moreover, are a reductio ad absurdum
of the reasoning upon which it is based. Who could suppose that the
probability of a purely hypothetical event, of whatever complexity,
in favour of which no positive argument exists, the like of which
has never been observed, and which has failed to occur on the one
occasion on which the hypothetical conditions were fulfilled, is no less
than 1
3
? Or if we do suppose it, we are involved in contradictions,—for
it is easy to imagine more than three incompatible events which
satisfy these conditions.
11. The theorem was first suggested by the problem of the
urn which contains black and white balls in unknown proportions: m
white and n black balls have been successively drawn and replaced;
what is the probability that the next draw will yield a white ball? It
is supposed that all compositions of the urn are equally probable, and
the proof then proceeds precisely as in the case of the more general
ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 431
rule of succession. The rule of succession has been, sometimes, directly
deduced from the case of the urn, by assimilating the occurrence of
the event to the drawing of a white ball and its non-occurrence to the
drawing of a black ball.
On the hypothesis that all compositions of the urn are equally
probable, an hypothesis to which in general there is nothing
corresponding, and on the further hypothesis that the number of balls
is infinite, this solution is correct.* But the rule of succession does
not apply, as it is easy to demonstrate, even to the case of balls
drawn from an urn, if the number of balls is finite.†
12. If the Rule of Succession is to be adopted by adherents of
the Frequency Theory of Probability,‡
it is necessary that they should
make some modification in the preliminary reasoning on which it is
based. By Dr. Venn, however, the rule has been explicitly rejected on
the ground that it does not accord with experience.§ But Professor

Karl Pearson, who accepts it, has made the necessary restatement,*
and it will be worth while to examine the reasoning when it is put in
this form. Professor Pearson’s proof of the Rule of Succession is as
follows:
“I start, as most mathematical writers have done, with ‘the equal
distribution of ignorance,’ or I assume the truth of Bayes’ Theorem.
I hold this theorem not as rigidly demonstrated, but I think with
Edgeworth†
that the hypothesis of the equal distribution of ignorance
is, within the limits of practical life, justified by our experience of
statistical ratios, which à priori are unknown, i.e. such ratios do not
tend to cluster markedly round any particular value. ‘Chances’ lie
between 0 and 1, but our experience does not indicate any tendency
of actual chances to cluster round any particular value in this range.
The ultimate basis of the theory of statistics is thus not mathematical
but observational. Those who do not accept the hypothesis of the
equal distribution of ignorance and its justification in observation are
compelled to produce definite evidence of the clustering of chances, or
to drop all application of past experience to the judgment of probable
future statistical ratios. . . .
“Let the chance of a given event occurring be supposed to lie
between x and x + dx, then if on n = p + q trials an event has been
observed to occur p times and fail q times, the probability that the
true chance lies between x and x + dx is, on the equal distribution of
our ignorance,

This is, with a slight correction, Laplace’s extension of Bayes’
Theorem.” †
13. This argument can be restated as follows. Of all the
objects which satisfy f(x), let us suppose that a proportion p also
satisfy f(x). In this case p measures the probability that any object,
of which we know only that it is f, is in fact also f. Now if we
do not know the value of p and have no relevant information which
bears upon it, we can assume à priori that all values of p between
0 and 1 are equally likely. This assumption, which is termed the
*Professor Pearson’s use of this title for the above formula is not, I think,
historically correct. Bayes’ Theorem is the Inverse Principle of Probability itself,
and not this extension of it.
†The rest of the article is concerned with the determination of the probable
error when Laplace’s Rule of Succession is used not simply to yield the
probability of a single additional occurrence, but to predict the probable limits
within which the frequency will lie in a considerable series of additional trials.
Professor Pearson’s method applies more rigorous methods of approximation to
the fundamental formulae given above than have been sometimes used. As my
main purpose in this chapter is to dispute the general validity of the fundamental
formulae, it is not worth while to consider these further developments here. If
the validity of the fundamental formula were to be granted, Professor Pearson’s
methods of approximation would, I think, be satisfactory.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 434
‘equal distribution of ignorance,’ is justified by our experience of
statistical ratios. Our experience, that is to say, leads us to suppose
that of all the theories, which could be propounded, there are just as
many which are always true as there are which are always false, just
as many which are true once in fifty times as there are which are true
once in three times, and so on. Professor Pearson challenges those
who do not accept this assumption to produce definite evidence to
the contrary.
The challenge is easily met. It would not be difficult to produce
10, 000 positive theories which are always false corresponding to
every one which is always true, and 10, 000 correlations of positive
qualities which hold less often than once in three times for every
one we can name which holds more often than once in three times.
And the converse is the case for negative theories and correlations
between negative qualities; for corresponding to every positive theory
which is true there is a negative theory which is false, and so
on. Thus experience, if it shows anything, shows that there is a
very marked clustering of statistical ratios in the neighbourhoods of
zero and unity,—of those for positive theories and for correlations
between positive qualities in the neighbourhood of zero, and of those
for negative theories and for correlations between negative qualities
in the neighbourhood of unity. Moreover, we are seldom in so
complete a state of ignorance regarding the nature of the theory or
correlation under investigation as not to know whether or not it is a
positive theory or a correlation between positive qualities. In general,
therefore, whenever our investigation is a practical one, experience,
if it tells us anything, tells us not only that the statistical ratios
cluster in the neighbourhood of zero and unity, but in which of these
two neighbourhoods the ratio in this particular case is most likely
à priori to be found. If we seek to discover what proportion of the
population suffer from a certain disease, or have red hair, or are
called Jones, it is preposterous to suppose that the proportion is as
likely à priori to exceed as to fall short of (say) fifty per cent. As
ch. xxx STATISTICAL INFERENCE 435
Professor Pearson applies this method to investigations where it is
plain that the qualities involved are positive, he seems to maintain
that experience shows that there are as many positive attributes
which are shared by more than half of any population as there are
which are shared by less than half.
It is also worthwhile to point out that it is formally impossible
that it should be true of all characters, simple and complex, that
they are as likely to have any one frequency as any other. For let
us take a character c which is compound of two characters a and b,
between which there is no association, and let us suppose that a
has a frequency x in the population in question and that b has a
frequency y, so that, in the absence of association, the frequency z
of c is equal to xy. Then it is easy to show that, if all values of
x and y between 0 and 1 are equally probable, all values of z between
0 and 1 are not equally probable. For the value 1
2
is more probable
than any other, and the possible values of z become increasingly
improbable as they differ more widely from 1
2
.
It may be added that the conclusions, which Professor Pearson
himself derives from this method, provide a reductio ad absurdum of
the arguments upon which they rest. He considers, for example, the
following problem: A sample of 100 of a population shows 10 per cent
affected with a certain disease. What percentage may be reasonably
expected in a second sample of 100? By approximation he reaches
the conclusion that the percentage of the character in the second
sample is as likely to fall inside as outside the limits, 7.85 and 13.71.
Apart from the preceding criticisms of the reasoning upon which
this depends, it does not seem reasonable upon general grounds
that we should be able on so little evidence to reach so certain a
conclusion. The argument does not require, for example, that we
have any knowledge of the manner in which the samples are chosen,
of the positive and negative analogies between the individuals, or
indeed anything at all beyond what is given in the above statement.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 436
The method is, in fact, much too powerful. It invests any positive
conclusion, which it is employed to support, with far too high a degree
of probability. Indeed this is so foolish a theorem that to entertain it
is discreditable.
14. The Rule of Succession has played a very important part
in the development of the theory of probability. It is true that it
has been rejected by Boole* on the ground that the hypotheses on
which it is based are arbitrary, by Venn† on the ground that it does
not accord with experience, by Bertrand‡ because it is ridiculous, and
doubtless by others also. But it has been very widely accepted,—by
De Morgan,§ by Jevons,¶ by Lotze,? by Czuber,** and by Professor
Pearson,††—to name some representative writers of successive schools
and periods. And, in any case, it is of interest as being one of the most
characteristic results of a way of thinking in probability introduced by
Laplace, and never thoroughly discarded to this day. Even amongst
those writers who have rejected or avoided it, this rejection has been
due more to a distrust of the particular applications of which the law
is susceptible than to fundamental objections against almost every
step and every presumption upon which its proof depends.
Some of these particular applications have certainly been surprising.
The law, as is evident, provides a numerical measure of the probability
of any simple induction, provided only that our ignorance of its

seek instances of the profound credulity of even considerable thinkers.

conditions is sufficiently complete, and, although, when the number
of cases dealt with is small, its results are incredible, there is, when
the number dealt with is large, a certain plausibility in the results
it gives. But even in these cases paradoxical conclusions are not
far out of sight. When Laplace proves that, account being taken
of the experience of the human race, the probability of the sun’s
rising to-morrow is 1, 826, 214 to 1, this large number may seem in a
kind of way to represent our state of mind about the matter. But
an ingenious German, Professor Bobek,* has pushed the argument a
degree further, and proves by means of these same principles that the
probability of the sun’s rising every day for the next 4000 years, is
not more, approximately, than two-thirds,—a result less dear to our
natural prejudices.

CHAPTER XXXI
the inversion of bernoulli’s theorem
1. I conclude, then, that the application of the mathematical
methods, discussed in the preceding chapter, to the general problem
of statistical inference is invalid. Our state of knowledge about our
material must be positive, not negative, before we can proceed to
such definite conclusions as they purport to justify. To apply these
methods to material, unanalysed in respect of the circumstances of
its origin, and without reference to our general body of knowledge,
merely on the basis of arithmetic and of those of the characteristics
of our material with which the methods of descriptive statistics are
competent to deal, can only lead to error and to delusion.
But I go further than this in my opposition to them. Not only are
they the children of loose thinking, and the parents of charlatanry.
Even when they are employed by wise and competent hands, I doubt
whether they represent the most fruitful form in which to apply
technical and mathematical methods to statistical problems, except
in a limited class of special cases. The methods associated with the
names of Lexis, Von Bortkiewicz, and Tschuprow (of whom the last
named forms a link, to some extent, between the two schools), which
will be briefly described in the next chapter, seem to me to be much
more clearly consonant with the principles of sound induction.
2. Nevertheless it is natural to suppose that the fundamental
ideas, from which these methods have sprung, are not wholly égarés.
It is reasonable to presume that, subject to suitable conditions and
qualifications, an inversion of Bernoulli’s Theorem must have validity.
If we knew that our material could be likened to a game of chance,
we might expect to infer chances from frequencies, with the same sort
of confidence as that with which we infer frequencies from chances.
This part of our inquiry will not be complete, therefore, until we
have endeavoured to elucidate the conditions for the validity of an
438
ch. xxxi STATISTICAL INFERENCE 439
Inversion of Bernoulli’s Theorem.
3. The problem is usually discussed in terms of the happening of
an event under certain conditions, that is to say, of the coexistence
of the conditions, as affecting a particular event, with that event.
The same problem can be dealt with more generally and more
conveniently as an investigation of the correlation between two
characters A(x) and B(x), which, as in Part III., are propositional
functions which may be said to concur or coexist when they are both
true of the same argument x. Given that, within the field of our
knowledge, B(x) is true for a certain proportion of the values of x for
which A(x) is true, what is the probability for a further value a of x
that, if A(a) holds, B(a) will hold also?
Let us suppose that the occurrence of an instance of A(x) is a
sign of one of the events e1(x), e2(x). . . or em(x), and that these are
exhaustive, exclusive, and ultimate alternatives. By exhaustive it is
meant that, whenever there is an instance of A(x), one of the e’s is
present; by exclusive, that the presence of one of the e’s is not a sign
of the presence of any other, but not that the concurrence of two or
more of the e’s is in fact impossible; by ultimate, that no one of the e’s
is a disjunction of two or more alternatives which might themselves be
members of the e’s. Let us assume that these alternatives are initially
and throughout the argument equally probable, which, subject to the
above conditions, is justified by the Principle of Indifference. We have
no reason, that is to say, and no part of our evidence ever gives us
one, for thinking that A(a) is more likely to be a sign of one of the e’s
than of any other, or even for thinking that some e’s, although we do
not know which, are more likely to occur than others. Let us also
assume that, out of e1(x), e2(x). . . em(x), the set e1(x), e2(x). . . el(x),
and these only, are signs or occasions of B(x); and further that we
have no evidence bearing on the actual magnitude of the integers
l and m, so that the ratio l/m is the only factor of which the
probability varies as the evidence accumulates. Let us assume, lastly,
that our knowledge of the several instances of B(x) is adequate
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 440
to establish a perfect analogy between them; the instances a, etc.,
of B(x), that is to say, must not have anything in common except B,
unless we have reason to know that the additional resemblances are
immaterial. Even by these considerable simplifications not every
difficulty has been avoided. But a development along the usual lines
with the assistance of Bernoulli’s Theorem is now possible.
Let l/m = q. If the value of q were known, the problem would
be solved. For this numerical ratio would represent the probability
that A is, in any random instance, a sign of B; and no further
evidence, which satisfies the conditions of the preceding hypothesis,
can possibly modify it. But in the inverse problem q is not known;
and our problem is to determine whether evidence can be forthcoming
of such a kind, that, as this evidence is increased in quantity, the
probability that A will be in any instance a sign of B, tends to a limit
which lies between two determinate ratios, just as the probability
of an inductive generalisation may tend towards certainty, when the
evidence is increased in a manner satisfying given conditions.
Let f(q) represent the proposition that q is the true value of l/m.
Let q
0
represent the ratio of the number of instances actually before
us in which A has been accompanied by B to that of the instances
in which A has not been accompanied by B; and let f
0
(q
0
) be the
proposition which asserts this. Now if the ratio q is known, then,
subject to the assumptions already stated, the number q must also
represent the à priori probability in any instance, both before and
after the results of other instances are known, that A, if it occurs, will
be accompanied by B. We have, in fact, the conditions as set forth in
Chapter XXIX., in which Bernoulli’s Theorem can be validly applied,
so that this theorem enables us to give a numerical value, for all
numerical values of q and q
0
, to the probability f
0
(q
0
)/h  f(q),—which
expression represents the likelihood à priori of the frequency q
0
,
given q.
An application of the inverse formula allows us to infer from the
ch. xxxi STATISTICAL INFERENCE 441
above the à posteriori probability of q, given q
0
, namely:
f(q)/h  f(q
0
)/h  f(q)
Pf(q)/h  f(q
0
)/h  f(q)
where the summation in the denominator covers all possible values
of q. In rough applications of this inverse of Bernoulli’s Theorem
it has been usual to suppose that f(q)/h is constant for all values
of q,—that, in other words, all possible values of the ratio q are
à priori equally likely. If this supposition were legitimate, the formula
could be reduced to the algebraical expression
f(q
0
)/h  f(q)
Pf(q
0
)/h  f(q)
,
all the terms of which can be determined numerically by Bernoulli’s
Theorem. It is easy to show that it is a maximum when q = q
0
,
i.e. that q
0
is the most probable value of l/m, and that, when the
instances are very numerous, it is very improbable that l/m differs
from q
0 widely. If, therefore, the number of instances is increased in
such a manner that the ratio continues in the neighbourhood of q
0
, the
probability that the true value of l/m is nearly q
0
tends to certainty;
and, consequently, the probability, that A is in any instance a sign
of B, also tends to a magnitude which is measured by q
0
.
I see, however, no justification for the assumption that all possible
values of the ratio q are à priori equally likely. It is not even
equivalent to the assumptions that all integral values of l and m
respectively are equally probable. I am not satisfied either that
different values of q, or that different values of m, satisfy the
conditions which have been laid down in Part I. for alternatives
which are equal before the Principle of Indifference. There seem, for
instance, to be relevant differences between the statement that A can
arise in exactly two ways and the statement that it can arise in
exactly a thousand ways. We must, therefore, be content with some
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 442
lesser assumption and with a less precise form for our final conclusion.
4. Since, in accordance with our hypothesis, m cannot exceed
some finite number, and since l must necessarily be less than m, the
possible values of m, and therefore of q, are finite in number. Perhaps
we can assume, therefore, as one of our fundamental assumptions,
that there is à priori a finite probability in favour of each of these
possible values. Let µ be the finite number which m cannot exceed.
Then there is a finite probability for each of the intervals*

to

, . . .

that q lies in this interval; but we cannot assume that there is an
equal probability for each interval.
We must now return to the formula
fq/h  f(q
0
)/hf(q)
Pf(q)/h  f(q
0
)/hf(q)
,
which represents the à posteriori probability of q, given q
0
. Since
by sufficiently increasing the number of instances, the sum of terms
f(q
0
)/hf(q) for possible values of q within a certain finite interval in
the neighbourhood of q
0
can be made to exceed the other terms by
any required amount, and since the sum of the values of f(q)/h for
possible values of q within this interval is finite, it clearly follows that
a finite number of instances can make the probability, that q lies in
an interval of magnitude 1/µ in the neighbourhood of q
0
, to differ
from certainty by less than any finite amount however small.
5. We have, therefore, reached the main part of the conclusion
after which we set out—namely, that as the number of instances
is increased the probability, that q is in the neighbourhood of q
0
,
tends towards certainty; and hence that, subject to certain specified
conditions, if the frequency with which B accompanies A is found
*The intervals are supposed to include their lower but not their upper limit.
ch. xxxi STATISTICAL INFERENCE 443
to be q
0
in a great number of instances, then the probability
that A will be accompanied by B in any further instance is also
approximately q
0
. But we are left with the same vagueness, as in the
case of generalisation, respecting the value of µ and the number of
instances that we require. We know that we can get as near certainty
as we choose by a finite number of instances, but what this number
is we do not know. This is not very satisfactory, but it accords very
well, I think, with what common sense tells us. It would be very
surprising, in fact, if logic could tell us exactly how many instances we
want, to yield us a given degree of certainty in empirical arguments.
Nobody supposes that we can measure exactly the probability of
an induction. Yet many persons seem to believe that in the weaker
and much more difficult type of argument, where the association
under examination has been in our experience, not invariable, but
merely in a certain proportion, we can attribute a definite measure
to our future expectations and can claim practical certainty for
the results of predictions which lie within relatively narrow limits.
Coolly considered, this is a preposterous claim, which would have
been universally rejected long ago, if those who made it had not so
successfully concealed themselves from the eyes of common sense in a
maze of mathematics.
6. Meantime we are in danger of forgetting that, in order
to reach even our modified conclusion, material assumptions have
been introduced. In the first place, we are faced with exactly the
same difficulties as in the case of universal induction dealt with in
Part III., and our original starting-point must be the same. We
have the same difficulty as to how our initial probability is to be
obtained; and I have no better suggestion to offer in this than
in the former case—namely, the supposed principle of a limitation
of independent variety in experience. We have to suppose that if
A and B occur together (i.e. are true of the same object), this is some
just appreciable reason for supposing that in this instance they have a
common cause; and that, if A occurs again, this is a just appreciable
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 444
reason for supposing that it is due to the same cause as on the
former occasion. But in addition to the usual inductive hypothesis,
the argument has rested on two particularly important assumptions,
first, that we have no reason for supposing that some of the events of
which A may be a sign are more likely to be exemplified in some of
the particular instances than in others, and secondly, that the analogy
amongst the examined B’s is perfect. The first assumption amounts,
in the language of statisticians, to an assumption of random sampling
from amongst the A’s. The second assumption corresponds precisely
to the similar condition which we discussed fully in connection with
inductive generalisation. The instances of A(x) may be the result
of random sampling, and yet it may still be the case that there
are material circumstances, common to all the examined instances
of B(x), yet not covered by the statement A(x)B(x). In so far as
these two assumptions are not justified, an element of doubt and
vagueness, which is not easily measured, assails the argument. It is
an element of doubt precisely similar to that which exists in the case
of generalisation. But we are more likely to forget it. For having
overcome the difficulties peculiar to correlation,*
it is, possibly, not
unnatural for a statistician to feel as if he had overcome all the
difficulties.
In practice, however, our knowledge, in cases of correlation just as
in cases of generalisation, will seldom justify the assumption of perfect
analogy between the B’s; and we shall be faced by precisely the same
problems of analysing and improving our knowledge of the instances,
as in the general case of induction already examined. If B has
invariably accompanied A in 100 cases, we have all kinds of difficulties
about the exact character of our evidence before we can found on
*
I am here using this term in distinction to generalisation; that is to say, I
call the statement that A(x) is always accompanied by B(x) a generalisation,
and the statement that A(x) is accompanied by B(x) in a certain proportion
of cases a correlation. This is not quite identical with its use by modern
statisticians.
ch. xxxi STATISTICAL INFERENCE 445
this experience a valid generalisation. If B has accompanied A, not
invariably, but only 50 times in the 100 cases, clearly we have just
the same kind of difficulties to face, and more too, before we can
announce a valid correlation. Out of the mere unanalysed statement
that B has accompanied A as often as not in 100 cases, without
precise particulars of the cases, or even if there were 1, 000, 000 cases
instead of 100, we can conclude very little indeed.
CHAPTER XXXII
the inductive use of statistical frequencies for
the determination of probability
à posteriori—the methods of lexis
1. No one supposes that a good induction can be arrived at
merely by counting cases. The business of strengthening the argument
chiefly consists in determining whether the alleged association is
stable, when the accompanying conditions are varied. This process
of improving the Analogy, as I have called it in Part III., is, both
logically and practically, of the essence of the argument.
Now in statistical reasoning (or inductive correlation) that part of
the argument, which corresponds to counting the cases in inductive
generalisation, may present considerable technical difficulty. This
is especially so in the particularly complex cases of what in the
next chapter (§ 9) I shall term Quantitative Correlation, which have
greatly occupied the attention of English statisticians in recent
years. But clearly it would be an error to suppose that, when
we have successfully overcome the mathematical or other technical
difficulties, we have made any greater progress towards establishing
our conclusion than when, in the case of inductive generalisation, we
have counted the cases but have not yet analysed or compared the
descriptive and non-numerical differences and resemblances. In order
to get a good scientific argument we still have to pursue precisely
the same scientific methods of experiment, analysis, comparison,
and differentiation as are recognised to be necessary to establish
any scientific generalisation. These methods are not reducible to
a precise mathematical form for the reasons examined in Part III.
of this treatise. But that is no reason for ignoring them, or for
pretending that the calculation of a probability, which takes into
account nothing whatever except the numbers of the instances, is
a rational proceeding. The passage already quoted from Leibniz
446
ch. xxxii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 447
(In exemplis juridicis politicisque plerumque non tamen subtili calculo
opus est, quam accurata omnium circumstantiarum enumeratione ) is
as applicable to scientific as to political inquiries.
Generally speaking, therefore, I think that the business of
statistical technique ought to be regarded as strictly limited to
preparing the numerical aspects of our material in an intelligible form,
so as to be ready for the application of the usual inductive methods.
Statistical technique tells us how to ‘count the cases’ when we are
presented with complex material. It must not proceed also, except in
the exceptional case where our evidence furnishes us from the outset
with data of a particular kind, to turn its results into probabilities;
not, at any rate, if we mean by probability a measure of rational
belief.
2. There is, however, one type of technical, statistical
investigation not yet discussed, which seems to me to be a valuable
aid to inductive correlation. This method consists in breaking up a
statistical series, according to appropriate principles, into a number
of sub-series, with a view to analysing and measuring, not merely
the frequency of a given character over the aggregate series, but the
stability of this frequency amongst the sub-series; that is to say, the
series as a whole is divided up by some principle of classification into
a set of sub-series, and the fluctuation of the statistical frequency
under examination between the various sub-series is then examined.
It is, in fact, a technical method of increasing the Analogy between
the instances, in the sense given to this process in Part III.
3. The method of analysing statistical series, as opposed
to the Laplacian or mathematical method, one might designate the
inductive method. Independently of the investigations of Bernoulli
or Laplace, practical statisticians began at least as early as the
end of the seventeenth century*
to pay attention to the stability of
*Graunt in his Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality
has been quoted as one of the earliest statisticians to pay attention to these
considerations.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 448
statistical series when analysed in this manner. Throughout the
eighteenth century, students of mortality statistics, and of the ratio
of male to female births (including Laplace himself), paid attention
to the degree of constancy of the ratios over different parts of their
series of instances as well as to their average value over the whole
series. And in the early part of the nineteenth century, Quetelet,
as we have already noticed, widely popularised the notion of the
stability of various social statistics from year to year. Quetelet,
however, sometimes asserted the existence of stability on insufficient
evidence, and involved himself in theoretical errors through imitating
the methods of Laplace too closely; and it was not until the last
quarter of the nineteenth century that a school of statistical theory
was founded, which gave to this way of approaching the problem
the system and technique which it had hitherto lacked, and at the
same time made explicit the contrast between this analytical or
inductive method and the prevailing mathematical theory. The sole
founder of this school was the German economist, Wilhelm Lexis,
whose theories were expounded in a series of articles and monographs
published between the years 1875 and 1879. For some years Lexis’s
fundamental ideas did not attract much notice, and he himself seems
to have turned his attention in other directions. But more recently
a considerable literature has grown up round them in Germany, and
their full purport has been expressed with more clearness than by
Lexis himself—although no one, with the exception of Ladislaus von
Bortkiewicz, has been able to make additions to them of any great
significance.* Lexis devised his theory with an immediate view to
*A list of Lexis’s principal writings on these topics will be found in the
Bibliography. There is little of first-rate importance which is not contained
either in the volume, Zur Theorie der Massenerscheinungen in der menschlichen
Gesellschaft, or in the Abhandlungen zur Theorie der Bevölkerungs- und
Moral-Statistik. In this latter volume the two important articles on “Die
Theorie der Stabilität statistischer Reihen” and on “Das Geschlechtsverhältnis
der Geborenen und die Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung,” originally published in
Conrad’s Jahrbüche, are reprinted.
ch. xxxii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 449
its practical application to the problems of sex ratio and mortality.
The fact that his general theory is so closely intermingled with these
particular applications of it is, probably, a part explanation of the
long interval which elapsed before the general theoretical importance
of his ideas was widely realised. I cannot help doubting how fully
Lexis himself realised it in the first instance. It would certainly
be easy to read his earlier contributions to the question without
appreciating their generalised significance. After 1879 Lexis added
nothing substantial to his earlier work, and later developments are
mainly due to Von Bortkiewicz. Those of the latter’s writings, which
have an important bearing on the relation between probability and
statistics, are given in the Bibliography.*
On the logic and philosophy of Probability writers of the school
of Lexis are in general agreement with Von Kries; but this seems
to be due rather to the reaction which is common both to him and
to them against the Laplacian tradition, than to any very intimate
theoretical connection between Von Kries’s main contributions to
Probability and those of Lexis, though it is true that both show
a tendency to find the ultimate basis of Probability in physical
rather than in logical considerations. I am not acquainted with
much work, which has been appreciably influenced by Lexis, written
in other languages than German (including with Germans, that is
*The reader may be specially referred to the Kritische Betrachtungen zur
theoretischen Statistik (first instalment—the later instalments being of less interest
to the student of Probability), the Anwendungen der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung
auf Statistik, and Homogeneität und Stabilität in der Statistik. Of other German
and Russian writers it will be sufficient to mention here Tschuprow, who in
“Die Aufgaben der Theorie der Statistik” (Schmoller’s Jahrbuch, 1905) and
“Zur Theorie der Stabilität statistischer Reihen” (Skandinavisk Aktuarietidskrift)
gives by far the best and most lucid general accounts that are available of
the doctrines of the school, he alone amongst these authors writing in a
style from which the foreign reader can derive pleasure, and Czuber, who in
his Wahrscheinlichtkeitsrechnung (vol. ii. part iv. section 1) supplies a useful
mathematical commentary.

to say, those Russians, Austrians, and Dutch who usually write in
German, and are in habitual connection with the German scientific
world). In France Dormoy* published independently and at about
the same time as Lexis some not dissimilar theories, but subsequent
French writers have paid little attention to the work of either. Such
typical French treatises as that of Bertrand, or, more recently, that
of Borel, contain no reference to them.†
In Italy there has been
some discussion recently on the work of Von Bortkiewicz. Among
Englishmen Professor Edgeworth has shown a close acquaintance with
the work of the German school,‡ he providing for nearly forty years
past, on this as on other matters where the realms of Statistics and
Probability overlap, almost the only connecting link between English
and continental thought.
Nevertheless, an account in English of the main doctrines of this
school is still lacking. It would be outside the plan of the present
treatise to attempt such an account here. But it may be useful
to give a short summary of Lexis’s fundamental ideas. After giving
this account I shall find it convenient, in proceeding to my own
incomplete observations on the matter, to approach it from a rather
different standpoint from that of Lexis or of Von Bortkewicz, though
not for that reason the less influenced or illuminated by their eminent
contributions to this problem.
4. It will be clearer to begin with some analysis due to
Von Bortkiewicz,§ and then to proceed to the method of Lexis

assurances sur la vie, 1878; on the question of priority see Lexis, Abhandlungen,

investigations would be highly relevant—Bertrand, Calcul, pp. 312–314; Borel,

§What follows is a free rendering of some passages in his Kritiscke
ch. xxxii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 451
himself, although the latter came first in point of time.
A group of observations may be made up of a number of
subgroups, to which different frequencies for the character under
investigation are properly applicable. That is to say, a proportion z1
z
of the observations may belong to a group, for which, given the
frequency, the à priori probability of the character under observation
in a particular instance would be p1, a proportion
z2
z
may belong to
a second group for which p2 is the probability, and so on. In this
case, given the frequencies for the subgroups, the probability p for
the group as a whole would be made up as follows:
p =
z1
z
p1 +
z2
z
p2 + . . . .
We may call p a general probability, and p1, etc., special
probabilities. But the special probabilities may in their turn be
general probabilities, so that there may be more than one way of
resolving a general probability into special probabilities.
If p1 = p2 = . . . = p, then p, for that particular way of resolving
the total group into partial groups, is, in Bortkiewicz’s terminology,
indifferent. If p is indifferent for all conceivable resolutions into
partial groups,*
then, borrowing a phrase from Von Kries, Bortkiewicz
says of it that it has a definitive interpretation. In dealing with
à priori probabilities, we can resolve a total probability until we
reach the special probabilities of each individual case; and if we find
that all these special probabilities are equal, then, clearly, the general
probability satisfies the condition for definitive interpretation.
So far we have been dealing with à priori probabilities. But the
object of the analysis has been to throw light on the inverse problem.
We want to discover in what conditions we can regard an observed
frequency as being an adequate approximation to a definitive general
probability.
Betrachungen.
*This is clearly a very loose statement of what Bortkiewicz really means.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 452
If p
0
is the empirical value of p (or, as I should prefer to call it,
the frequency) given by a series of n observations, we may have
p
0 =
n1
n
p
0
1 +
n2
n
p
0
2 + . . . .
Even if this particular way of resolving the series of observations
is indifferent, the actually observed frequencies p
0
1
, p0
2
, etc., may
nevertheless be unequal, since they may fluctuate round the norm p
0
through the operation of ‘chance’ influences. If, however, n1, n2, etc.,
are large, we can apply the usual Bernoullian formula to discover
whether, if there was a norm p
0
, the divergences of p
0
1
, p0
2
, etc.,
from it are within the limits reasonably attributable on Bernoullian
hypotheses to ‘chance’ influences. We can, however, only base a sound
argument in favour of the existence of a ‘definitive’ probability p
0 by
resolving our aggregate of instances into sub-series in a great variety
of ways, and applying the above calculations each time. Even so,
some measure of doubt must remain, just as in the case of other
inductive arguments.
Bortkiewicz goes on to say that probabilities having definitive
interpretation (definitive Bedeutung) may be designated elementary
probabilities (Elementarwahrscheinlichkeiten). But the probabilities
which usually arise in statistical inquiries are not of this type, and may
be termed average probabilities (Durchschnittswahrscheinlichkeiten).
That is to say, a series of observed frequencies (or, as he calls them,
empirical probabilities) does not, as a rule, group itself as it would if
the series was in fact subject to an elementary probability.
5. This exposition is based on a philosophy of Probability
different from mine; but the underlying ideas are capable of
translation. Suppose that one is endeavouring to establish an
inductive correlation, e.g. that the chance of a male birth is m. The
conclusion, which we are seeking to establish, takes no account of
the place or date of birth or the race of the parents, and assumes
that these influences are irrelevant. Now, if we had statistics of
ch. xxxii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 453
birth ratios for all parts of the world throughout the nineteenth
century, and added them all up and found that the average frequency
of male births was m, we should not be justified in arguing from
this that the frequency of male births in England next year is
very unlikely to diverge widely from m. For this would involve
the unwarranted assumption, in Bortkiewicz’s terminology, that the
empirical probability m is elementary for any resolution dependent on
time or place, and is not an average probability compounded out of a
series of groups, relating to different times or places, to each of which
a distinct special probability is applicable. And, in my terminology,
it would assume that variations of time and place were irrelevant to
the correlation, without any attempt having been made to employ
the methods of positive and negative Analogy to establish this.
We must, therefore, break up our statistical material into groups
by date, place, and any other characteristic which our generalisation
proposes to treat as irrelevant. By this means we shall obtain a
number of frequencies m0
1
, m0
2
, m0
3
, . . . m00
1
, m00
2
, m00
3
, . . . etc., which are
distributed round the average frequency m. For simplicity let us
consider the series of frequencies m0
1
, m0
2
, m0
3
, . . . obtained by breaking
up our material according to the date of the birth. If the observed
divergences of these frequencies from their mean are not significant,
we have the beginnings of an inductive argument for regarding date
as being in this connection irrelevant.
6. At this point Lexis’s fundamental contribution to the problem
must be introduced. He concentrated his attention on the nature
of the dispersion of the frequencies m0
1
, m0
2
, m0
3
. . . round their mean
value m; and he sought to devise a technical method for measuring
the degree of stability displayed by the series of sub-frequencies, which
are yielded by the various possible criteria for resolving the aggregate
statistical material into a number of constituent groups.
For this purpose he classified the various types of dispersion which
could occur. It may be the case that some of the sub-frequencies
show such wide and discordant variations from the mean as to suggest
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 454
that some significant Analogy has been overlooked. In this event
the lack of symmetry, which characterises the oscillations, may be
taken to indicate that some of the subgroups are subject to a relevant
influence, of which we must take account in our generalisation, to
which some of the other subgroups are not subject.
But amongst the various types of dispersion Lexis found one class
clearly distinguishable from all the others, the peculiarity of which
is that the individual values fluctuate in a ‘purely chance’ manner
about a constant fundamental value. This type he called typical
(typische) dispersion. He meant by this that the dispersion conformed
approximately to the distribution which would be given by some
normal law of error.
The next stage of Lexis’s argument* was to point out that series
of frequencies which are typical in character may have as their
foundation either a constant probability,† or one which is itself subject
to chance variations about a mean. The first case is typified by the
example of a series of sets of drawings of balls, each set being drawn
from a similar urn; the second case by the example of a series of sets
of drawings, the urns from which each set is drawn being not similar,
but with constitutions which vary in a chance manner about a mean.
As his measure of dispersion Lexis introduces a formula, which
is evidently in part conventional (as is the case with so many other
statistical formulae, the particular shape of which is often determined
by mathematical convenience rather than by any more fundamental
criterion). He expresses himself as follows. Where the underlying
probability is constant, the probable error in a particular frequency
à priori is r = ?
r
2v(1 - v)
g
, where ? = .4769, v is the underlying
*
I am here following fairly closely his paper, “Über die Theorie der
Stabilität statisticher Reihen,” reprinted in his Abhandlungen zur Theorie der
Bevölkerungsund Moral-Statistik, pp. 170–212.
†This mode of expression, which is not in accurate conformity with my
philosophy of Probability, is Lexis’s, not mine. His meaning is intelligible.
ch. xxxii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 455
probability, and g is the number of instances to which the frequency
refers. This follows from the usual Bernoullian assumptions. Now let
R be the corresponding expression derived à posteriori by reference
to the actual deviations of a series of observed frequencies from their
mean, so that R = ?
r
2[d
2
]
n - 1
, where [d
2
] is the sum of the squares
of the deviations of the individual frequencies from their mean and
n is their number. Now, if the observed facts are due to merely
chance variations about a constant v, we must have approximately
R = r, though, if g is small, comparatively wide deviations between
R and r will not be significant. If, on the other hand, v itself
is not constant but is subject to chance variations, the case stands
differently. For the fluctuations of the observed frequencies are now
due to two components. The one which would be present, even if
the underlying probability were constant, Lexis terms the ordinary or
unessential component; the other he terms the physical component.
If p is the probable deviation of the various values of v from their
mean, then, on the same assumptions and as a deduction from the
same theory as before, R will tend to equal not r but p
r
2 + p
2
. In
this event R cannot be less than r. If, therefore, R < r, one must
suppose that the individual instances of each several series on which
each frequency is based are not independent of one another. Such a
series Lexis terms an organic or dependent (gebundene) series, and
explains that it cannot be handled by purely statistical methods.
Since, therefore, we have three types of series, differing fundamentally
from one another according as R = r, > r, or < r, Lexis puts
R
r
= Q, and takes Q as his measure of dispersion.*
If Q = 1, we have
normal dispersion; if Q > 1, we have supernormal dispersion; and if
*
In Tschuprow’s notation (Die Aufgaben der Theorie der Statistik, p. 45),
Q = P/C, where P (the Physical modulus) =

k
P=n
k=1
(pk - p)
2
n
and C (the
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 456
Q < 1, we have subnormal dispersion, which is an indication that the
series is ‘organic.’
If the number of instances on which the frequencies are based is
very great, r becomes negligible in comparison with p (the physical
component), and, therefore, R = p
r
2 + p
2 becomes approximately
R = p. On the other hand, if p is not very large and the base number
of instances is small, p becomes negligible in comparison with r, and
we have a delusive appearance of normal dispersion.* Lexis well
illustrates the former point by the example that the statistics of the
ratio of male to female births for the forty-five registration districts of
England over the years 1859–1871 approximately satisfy the relation
R = r. But if we take the figures for all England over those thirteen
years, although the extreme limits of the fluctuation of the ratio
about its mean 1.042 are 1.035 and 1.047, nevertheless R = 2.6 and
r = 1.6, so that Q = 1.625; the explanation being that the base
number of instances, namely 730, 000, is so large that r is very small,
with the result that it is swamped by the physical component p.
And he illustrates the latter point by the assertion that, if in 20 or
30 series each of 100 draws from an urn containing black and white
balls equally, the number of black balls drawn each time were only to
vary between 49 and 51, he would have confidence that the game was
in some way falsified and that the draws were not independent. That
is to say, undue regularity is as fatal to the assumption of Bernoullian
conditions as is undue dispersion.

the Aeneid. The mean for the line is 1.6, exclusive of the fifth foot,
thus sharply distinguishing the Virgilian line from the Ovidian, for
which the corresponding figure is 2.2. But there is also a marked
stability. “That the Mean of any five lines should differ from the
general Mean by a whole dactyl is proved to be an exceptional
phenomenon, about as rare as an Englishman measuring 5 feet, or
6 feet 3 inches. An excess of two dactyls in the Mean of five
lines would be as exceptional as an Englishman measuring 6 feet
10 inches.” But not only so—the stability is excessive, and the
fluctuation is less “than that which is obtained upon the hypothesis
of pure sortition. If we could imagine dactyls and spondees to be
mixed up in the poet’s brain in the proportion of 16 to 24 and
shaken out at random, the modulus in the number of dactyls would
be 1.38, whereas we have constantly obtained a smaller number, on
an average (the square root of the average fluctuation) 1.2.” On
Lexian principles these statistical results would support the hypothesis
that the series under investigation is ‘organic’ and not subject to
Bernoullian conditions, an hypothesis in accordance with our ideas
of poetry. That Edgeworth should have put forward this example in
criticism of Lexis’s conclusions, and that Lexis*
should have retorted
that the explanation was to be found in Edgeworth’s series’ not
consisting of an adequate number of separate observations, indicates,
if I do not misapprehend them, that these authorities are at fault in
the principles, if not of Probability, of Poetry.
The dactyls of the Virgilian hexameter are, in fact, a very good
example of what has been termed connexité, leading to subnormal
dispersion. The quantities of the successive feet are not independent,
and the appearance of a dactyl in one foot diminishes the probability
of another dactyl in that line. It is like the case of drawing black and
white balls out of an urn, where the balls are not replaced. But Lexis
is wrong if he supposes that a supernormal dispersion cannot also
*
“Über die Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung,” p. 444 (see Bibliography).
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 458
arise out of connexité, or organic connection between the successive
terms. It might have been the case that the appearance of a dactyl
in one foot increased the probability of another dactyl in that line.
He should, I think, have contemplated the result R > r as possibly
indicating a non-typical, organic series, and should not have assumed
that, where R is greater than r, it is of the form p
r
2 + p
2
.
In short, Lexis has not pushed his analysis far enough, and he has
not fully comprehended the character of the underlying conditions.
But this does not affect the fact that it was he who made the
vital advance of taking as the unit, not the single observation, but
the frequency in given conditions, and of conceiving the nature of
statistical induction as consisting in the examination, and if possible
the measurement, of the stability of the frequency when the conditions
are varied.
8. There is one special piece of work illustrative of the above
methods, due to Von Bortkiewicz, which must not be overlooked, and
which it is convenient to introduce in this place—the so-called Law of
Small Numbers.
*
Quetelet, as we have seen in Chapter XXVIII., called attention
to the remarkable regularity of comparatively rare events. Von
Bortkiewicz has enlarged Quetelet’s catalogue with modern instances
out of the statistical records of bureaucratic Germany. The classic
instance, perhaps, is the number of Prussian cavalrymen killed each
year by the kick of a horse. The table is worth giving as a statistical
curiosity. (The period is from 1875 to 1894; G stands for the Corps
of Guards, and I.–XV. for the 15 Army Corps.)
The agreement of this table with the theoretical results of a
random distribution of the total number of casualties is remarkably
close:†
*There are numerous references to this phenomenon in periodical literature;
but it is sufficient to refer the reader to Von Bortkiewicz’s Das Gesetz der

It is Von Bortkiewicz’s thesis that these observed regularities have
a good theoretical explanation behind them, which he dignifies with
the name of the Law of Small Numbers.
The reader will recall that, according to the theory of Lexis, his
measure of stability Q is, in the more general case, made up of
two components r and p, combined in the expression p
r
2 + p
2
, of
which one is due to fluctuations from the average of the conditions
governing all the members of a series, which furnishes us with one of
our observed frequencies, and of which the other is due to fluctuations
in the individual members of the series about the true norm of the
series. Bortkiewicz carries the same analysis a little further, and
shows that Lexis’s Q is of the form p
1 + (n - 1)c
2
, where n is the
number of times that the event occurs in each series.* That is to
say, Q increases with n, and, when n is small, Q is likely to exceed
unity to a less extent than when n is large. To postulate that n is
small, is, when we are dealing with observations drawn from a wide

field, the same thing as to say that the event we are looking for is a
comparatively rare one. This, in brief, is the mathematical basis of
the Law of Small Numbers.
In his latest published work on these topics,* Von Bortkiewicz
builds his mathematical structure considerably higher, without,
however, any further underpinning of the logical foundations of it. He
has there worked out further statistical constants, arising out of the
conceptions on which Lexis’s Q is based (the precise bearing of which
is not made any clearer by his calling them coefficients of syndromy),
which are explicitly dependent on the value of n; and he elaborately
compares the theoretical value of the coefficients with the observed
value in certain actual statistical material. He concludes with the
thesis, that Homogeneity and Stability (defined as he defines them)
are opposed conceptions, and that it is not correct to premise, that
the larger statistical mass is as a rule more stable than the smaller,
unless we also assume that the larger mass is less homogeneous.
At this point, it would have helped, if Von Bortkiewicz, excluding
from his vocabulary homogeneity, paradromy, ?
0
M, and the like, had
stopped to tell in plain language where his mathematics had led him,
and also whence they had started. But like many other students of
Probability he is eccentric, preferring algebra to earth.
9. Where, then, though an admirer, do I criticise all this? I think
that the argument has proceeded so far from the premisses, that it
has lost sight of them. If the limitations prescribed by the premisses
are kept in mind, I do not contest the mathematical accuracy of the
results. But many technical terms have been introduced, the precise
signification and true limitations of which will be misunderstood if
*
“Homogeneität und Stabilität in der Statistik,” published in the Skandinavisk
Aktuarielidskrift, 1918. Those readers, who look up my references, will, I think,
agree with me that Von Bortkiewicz does not get any less obscure as he goes
on. The mathematical argument is right enough, and often brilliant. But what
it is all really about, what it all really amounts to, and what the premisses are,
it becomes increasingly perplexing to decide.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 462
the conclusion of the argument is allowed to detach itself from the
premisses and to stand by itself. I will illustrate what I mean by two
examples from the work of Von Bortkiewicz described above.
Von Bortkiewicz enunciates the seeming paradox that the larger
statistical mass is only, as a rule, more stable if it is less homogeneous.
But an illustration which he himself gives shows how misleading his
aphorism is. The opposition between stability and homogeneity is
borne out, he says, by the judgment of practical men. For actuaries
have always maintained that their results average out better, if their
cases are drawn from a wide field subject to variable conditions of
risk, whilst they are chary of accepting too much insurance drawn
from a single homogeneous area which means a concentration of risk.
But this is really an instance of Von Bortkiewicz’s own distinction
between a general probability p and special probabilities p1 etc., where
p =
z1
z
p1 +
z2
z
p2 + . . . .
If we are basing our calculations on p and do not know p1, p2, etc.,
then these calculations are more likely to be borne out by the result
if the instances are selected by a method which spreads them over
all the groups 1, 2, etc., than if they are selected by a method which
concentrates them on group 1. In other words, the actuary does
not like an undue proportion of his cases to be drawn from a group
which may be subject to a common relevant influence for which
he has not allowed. If the à priori calculations are based on the
average over a field which is not homogeneous in all its parts, greater
stability of result will be obtained if the instances are drawn from
all parts of the non-homogeneous total field, than if they are drawn
now from one homogeneous subfield and now from another. This is
not at all paradoxical. Yet I believe, though with hesitation, that
this is all that Von Bortkiewicz’s elaborately supported mathematical
conclusion really amounts to.
My second example is that of the Law of Small Numbers. Here
also we are presented with an apparent paradox in the statement that
ch. xxxii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 463
the regularity of occurrence of rare events is more stable than that
of commoner events. Here, I suspect, the paradoxical result is really
latent in the particular measure of stability which has been selected.
If we look back at the figures, which I have quoted above, of Prussian
cavalrymen killed by the kick of a horse, it is evident that a measure
of stability could be chosen according to which exceptional instability
would be displayed by this particular material; for the frequency
varies from 0 to 4 round a mean somewhat less than unity, which is a
very great percentage fluctuation. In fact, the particular measure of
stability which Von Bortkiewicz has adopted from Lexis has about it,
however useful and convenient it may be, especially for mathematical
manipulation, a great deal that is arbitrary and conventional. It
is only one out of a great many possible formulae which might
be employed for the numerical measurement of the conception of
stability, which, quantitatively at least, is not a perfectly precise
one. The so-called Law of Small Numbers is, therefore, little more
than a demonstration that, where rare events are concerned, the
Lexian measure of stability does not lead to satisfactory results. Like
some other formulae which involve a use of Bernoullian methods in
an approximative form, it does not lead to reliable results in all
circumstances, I should add that there is one other element which
may contribute to the total psychological reaction of the reader’s
mind to the Law of Small Numbers, namely, the surprising and
piquant examples which are cited in support of it. It is startling and
even amusing to be told that horses kick cavalrymen with the same
sort of regularity as characterises the rainfall. But our surprise at this
particular example’s fulfilling the Law of Great Numbers has little or
nothing to do with the exceptional stability about which the Law of
Small Numbers purports to concern itself.
CHAPTER XXXIII
outline of a constructive theory
1. There is a great difference between the proposition. “It is
probable that every instance of this generalisation is true” and the
proposition “It is probable of any instance of this generalisation taken
at random that it is true.” The latter proposition may remain valid,
even if it is certain that some instances of the generalisation are false.
It is more likely than not, for example, that any number will be
divisible either by two or by three, but it is not more likely than not
that all numbers are divisible either by two or by three.
The first type of proposition has been discussed in Part III. under
the name of Universal Induction. The latter belongs to Inductive
Correlation or Statistical Induction, an attempt at the logical analysis
of which must be my final task.
2. What advocates of the Frequency Theory of Probability
wrongly believe to be characteristic of all probabilities, namely, that
they are essentially concerned not with single instances but with series
of instances, is, I think, a true characteristic of statistical induction.
A statistical induction either asserts the probability of an instance
selected at random from a series of propositions, or else it assigns the
probability of the assertion, that the truth frequency of a series of
propositions (i.e. the proportion of true propositions in the series) is
in the neighbourhood of a given value. In either case it is asserting a
characteristic of a series of propositions, rather than of a particular
proposition.
Whilst, therefore, our unit in the case of Universal Induction is a
single instance which satisfies both the condition and the conclusion of
our generalisation, our unit in the case of Statistical Induction is not a
single instance, but a set or series of instances, all of which satisfy the
condition of our generalisation but which satisfy the conclusion only
in a certain proportion of cases. And whilst in Universal Induction we
464
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 465
build up our argument by examining the known positive and negative
Analogy shown in a series of single instances, the corresponding task
in Statistical Induction consists in examining the Analogy shown in a
series of series of instances.
3. We are presented, in problems of Statistical Induction,
with a set of instances all of which satisfy the conditions of our
generalisation, and a proportion f of which satisfy its conclusion; and
we seek to generalise as to the probable proportion in which further
instances will satisfy the conclusion.
Now it is useless merely to pay attention to the proportion (or
frequency) f discovered in the aggregate of the instances. For any
collection whatever, comprising a definite number of objects, must, if
the objects be classified with reference to the presence or absence of
any specified characteristic whatever, show some definite proportion
or statistical frequency of occurrence; so that a mere knowledge of
what this frequency is can have no appreciable bearing on what the
corresponding frequency will be for some other collection of objects,
or on the probability of finding the characteristic in an object which
does not belong to the original collection. We should be arguing in
the same sort of way as if we were to base a universal induction
as to the concurrence of two characteristics on a single observation
of this concurrence, and without any analysis of the accompanying
circumstances.
Let the reader be clear about this. To argue from the mere fact that
a given event has occurred invariably in a thousand instances under
observation, without any analysis of the circumstances accompanying
the individual instances, that it is likely to occur invariably in future
instances, is a feeble inductive argument, because it takes no account
of the Analogy. Nevertheless an argument of this kind is not entirely
worthless, as we have seen in Part III. But to argue, without analysis
of the instances, from the mere fact that a given event has a frequency
of 10 per cent in the thousand instances under observation, or even in
a million instances, that its probability is 1/10 for the next instance,
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 466
or that it is likely to have a frequency near to 1/10 in a further
set of observations, is a far feebler argument; indeed it is hardly an
argument at all. Yet a good deal of statistical argument is not free
from this reproach;—though persons of common sense often conclude
better than they argue, that is to say, they select for credence, from
amongst arguments similar in form, those in favour of which there is
in fact other evidence tacitly known to them though not explicit in
the premisses as stated.
4. The analysis of statistical induction is not fundamentally
different from that of universal induction already attempted in Part
III. But it is much more intricate; and I have experienced exceptional
difficulty, as the reader may discover for himself in the following
pages, both in clearing up my own mind about it and in expounding
my conclusions precisely and intelligibly. I propose to begin with a
few examples of what commonly impresses us as good arguments in
this field, and also of the attendant circumstances which, if they were
known to exist, might be held to justify such a mode of reasoning;
and, having thus attempted to bring before the reader’s mind the
character of the subject-matter, to proceed to an abstract analysis.
Example One.—Let us investigate the generalisation that the
proportion of male to female births is m. The fact that the
aggregate statistics for England during the nineteenth century yield
the proportion m would go no way at all towards justifying the
statement that the proportion of male births in Cambridge next year
is likely to approximate to m. Our argument would be no better if
our statistics, instead of relating to England during the nineteenth
century, covered all the descendants of Adam. But if we were able to
break up our aggregate series of instances into a series of sub-series,
classified according to a great variety of principles, as for example
by date, by season, by locality, by the class of the parents, by the
sex of previous children, and so forth, and if the proportion of male
births throughout these sub-series showed a significant stability in
the neighbourhood of m, then indeed we have an argument worth
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 467
something. Otherwise we must either abandon our generalisation,
amplify its conditions, or modify its conclusion.
Example Two.—Let us take a series of objects s all alike in some
specified respect, this resemblance constituting membership of the
class F; let us determine of how many members of the series a certain
property f is true, the frequency of which is to be the subject of
our generalisation; and if a proportion f of the series s have the
property f we may say that the series s has a frequency f for the
property f.
Now if the whole field F has a finite number of constituents,
it must have some determinate frequency p, and if, therefore, we
increase the comprehensiveness of s until eventually it includes the
whole field, f must come in the end to be equal to p. This is obvious
and without interest and not what we mean by the law of great
numbers and the stability of statistical frequency.
Let us now divide up the field F, according to some determinate
principle of division D, into subfields F1, F2, etc.; and let the series s1
be taken from F1, s2 from F2, and so on. Where F1, F2, etc., have
a finite number of constituents, s1, s2 etc., may possibly coincide
with them; if s1, s2 etc., do not coincide with F1, F2, etc., but are
chosen from them, let us suppose that they are chosen according
to some principle of random or unbiassed selection—s1, that is to
say, will be a random sample from F1. Now it may happen that
the frequencies f1, f2, etc., of the series s1, s2, etc., thus selected
cluster round some mean frequency f. If the frequencies show this
characteristic (the measurement and precise determination of which I
am not now considering), then the series of series s1, s2, etc., has a
stable frequency for the classification D. ‘Great numbers’ only come
in because it is difficult to ascertain the existence of stable frequency
unless the series s1, s2, etc., are themselves numerous and unless each
of these comprises numerous individual instances.
Let us then apply a different principle of division D0
, leading
to series s
0
1
, s0
2
, etc., and to frequencies f
0
1
, f0
2
, etc.; and then again
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 468
a third principle of division D00 leading to frequencies f
00
1
, f00
2
, etc.;
and so on, to the full extent that our knowledge of the differences
between the individual instances permits us. If the frequencies
f1, f2, etc., f
0
1
, f0
2
, etc., f
00
1
, f00
2
, etc., and so on are all stable about f,
we have an inductive ground of some weight for asserting a statistical
generalisation.
Let the field F, for example, comprise all Englishmen in their
sixtieth year, and let the property f, about the frequency of which
we are generalising, be their death in that year of their age. Now
the field F can be divided into subfields F1, F2, etc., on innumerable
different principles. F1 might represent Englishmen in their sixtieth
year in 1901, F2 in 1902, and so on; or we might classify them
according to the districts in which they live; or according to the
amount of income tax they pay; or according as they are in
workhouses, in hospitals, in asylums, in prisons, or at large. Let
us take the second of these classifications and let the subfields
F1, F2, etc., be constituted by the districts in which they live. If we
take large random selections s1, s2, etc., from F1, F2, etc., respectively,
and find that the frequencies, f1, f2, etc., fluctuate closely round a
mean value f, this can be expressed by the statement that there
is a stable frequency f for death in the sixtieth year in different
English districts. We might also find a similar stability for all the
other classifications. On the other hand, for the third and fourth
classifications we might find no stability at all, and for the first a
greater or less degree of stability than for the second. In the latter
case the form of our statistical generalisation must be modified or the
argument in its favour weakened.
Example Three.—Let us return to the example given in Chapter
XXVII. of the dog which is fed sometimes by scraps at table and so
judges it reasonable to be there. From one year to another, let us
assume, the dog gets scraps on a proportion of days more or less
stable. What sorts of explanation might there be of this? First,
it might be the case that he was fed on the movable feasts of the
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 469
Church; there would be the same number of these in each year, but it
would not be easy for any one who had not the clue to discover any
regularity in the occasions of their individual occurrence. Second, it
might be the case that he was given scraps whenever he looked thin,
and that the scraps were withheld whenever he looked fat, so that if
he was given scraps on one day, this diminished the likelihood of his
getting scraps on the next day, whilst if they were withheld this would
increase the likelihood; the dog’s constitution remaining constant, the
number of days for scraps would tend to fluctuate from year to year
about a stable value. Third, it might be the case that the company
at table varied greatly from day to day, and that some days people
were there of the kind who give dogs scraps and other days not; if
the set of people from whom the company was drawn remained more
or less the same from year to year, and it was a matter of chance (in
the objective sense defined in § 8 of Chapter XXIV. above) which of
them were there from day to day, the proportion of days for scraps
might again show some degree of stability from year to year. Lastly,
a combination between the first and third type of circumstance gives
rise to a variant deserving separate mention. It might be the case
that the dog was only given scraps by his master, that his master
generally went away for Saturday and Sunday, and was at home the
rest of the week unless something happened to the contrary, and
that “chance” causes would sometimes intervene to keep him at home
for the week-end and away in the week; in this case the frequency
of days for scraps would probably fluctuate in the neighbourhood of
five-sevenths. In circumstances of this third type, however, the degree
of stability would probably be less than in circumstances of the first
two types; and in order to get a really stable frequency it might be
necessary to take a longer period than a year as the basis for each
series of observations, or even to take the average for a number of
dogs placed in like circumstances instead of one dog only.
It has been assumed so far that we have an opportunity of
observing what happens on every day of the year. If this is not the
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 470
case and we have knowledge only of a random sample from the days
of each year, then the stability, though it will be less in degree, may
be nevertheless observable, and will increase as the number of days
included in each sample is increased. This applies equally to each of
the three types.
5. What is the correct logical analysis of this sort of reasoning?
If an inductive generalisation is a true one, the conclusion which
it asserts about the instance under inquiry is, so far as it goes,
definite and final, and cannot be modified by the acquisition of more
detailed knowledge about the particular instance. But a statistical
induction, when applied to a particular instance, is not like this;
for the acquisition of further knowledge might render the statistical
induction, though not in itself less probable than before, inapplicable
to that particular instance.
This is due to the fact that a statistical induction is not really
about the particular instance at all, but has its subject, about
which it generalises, a series; and it is only applicable to the
particular instance, in so far as the instance is relative to our
knowledge, a random member of the series. If the acquisition of
new knowledge affords us additional relevant information about the
particular instance, so that it ceases to be a random member of the
series, then the statistical induction ceases to be applicable; but the
statistical induction does not for that reason become any less probable
than it was—it is simply no longer indicated by our data as being the
statistical generalisation appropriate to the instance under inquiry.
The point is illustrated by the familiar example that the probability
of an unknown individual posting a letter unaddressed can be based
on the statistics of the Post Office, but my expectation that I shall
act thus, cannot be so determined.
Thus a statistical generalisation is always of the form: ‘The
probability, that an instance taken at random from the series S will
have the characteristic f, is p;’ or, more precisely, if a is a random
member of S(x), the probability of f(a) is p.
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 471
It will be convenient to recapitulate from Chapter XXIV. § 11
the definition of ‘an instance taken at random’: Let f(x) stand for
‘x has the characteristic f,’ and S(x) for ‘x is a member of the
class S’; then, on evidence h, a is a random member of the class S
for characteristic f, if ‘x is a’ is irrelevant to f(x)/S(x)  h,
*
i.e. if we
have no information about a relevant to f(a) except S(a).
Or alternatively we might express our definition as follows:
Consider a particular instance a, where the object of our inquiry is
the probability of f(a) relative to evidence h. Let us discard that
part of our knowledge h(a) which is irrelevant to f(a), leaving us
with relevant knowledge h
0
(a). Let the class of instances a1, a2, etc.,
which satisfy h
0
(x) be designated by S. Then, relative to evidence h,
a is a random member of the class or series S for the characteristic f.
Let us denote the proposition ‘x is, on evidence h, a random
member of S for characteristic f’ by R(x, S, f, h); then our statistical
generalisation is of the form f(x)/R(x, S, f, h)  h = p.
If R(a, S, f, h) holds, then, on evidence h, S is the appropriate
statistical series to which to refer a for the purposes of the
characteristic f.
It is not always the case that the evidence indicates any series at
all as ‘appropriate’ in the above sense. In particular, if evidence h
indicates S as the appropriate series, and evidence h
0
indicates S
0 as
the appropriate series, then relative to evidence hh0
(assuming these
to be not incompatible), it may be the case that no determinate series
is indicated as appropriate. In this case the method of statistical
induction fails us as a means of determining the probability under
inquiry.
6. We can now remove our attention from the individual
instance a to the properties of the series S. What sort of evidence is
*The use of variables in probability, as has been pointed out on p. 63, is
very dangerous. It might therefore be better to enunciate the above: a is a
random member of S for characteristic f, if f(a)/S(a)  h = f(b)/S(b)  h where
S(b)  h contains no information about b, except that b is a member of S.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 472
capable of justifying the conclusion that p is the probability that a
random member of the series S will have the characteristic f?
In the simplest case, S is a finite series of which we know the
truth frequency for the characteristic f, namely f.
* Then by a
straightforward application of the Principle of Indifference we have
p = f, so that f(x)/R(x, S, f, h)  h = f.
In another important type S is a series, with an indefinite number
of members which, however, group themselves in such a way that for
every member of which f(x) is true, there corresponds a determinate
number of members of which f(x) is false. The series, that is to say,
contains an indefinite number of atoms, but each atom is made up of
a set of molecules of which f(x) is true and false respectively in fixed
and determinate proportions. If this determinate proportion is known
to be f, we have, as before, p = f. The typical instance of this type
is afforded by games of chance. Every possible state of affairs which
might lead to a divergence in one direction is balanced by another
probability leading in the opposite direction; and these alternative
possibilities are of a kind to which the Principle of Indifference is
applicable. Thus for every poise of the dice box which leads to the
fall of the six-face, there is a corresponding poise which leads to the
fall of each of the other faces; so that if S is the series of possible
poises, we may equate p to 1
6 where f is the fall of the six-face. It is
not necessary, in order to obtain this result, to assert that S is a finite
series with an actual determinate frequency f for the fall of each face.
So far no inductive element enters in. But in general we do
not know the constitution of S for certain, and can only infer it
inductively from its resemblance to other series of which we know
the constitution. This presents a normal inductive problem—the
determination by an analysis of the positive and negative analogies
as to whether the respects in which S differs or may differ from the
other series is or is not relevant in the particular context f; and it
*
I.e. if f is the proportion of the members of the series for which f(x) is
true.
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 473
involves the same sort of considerations as those discussed in Part III.
There is, however, a further difficulty to be introduced before we
have reached the typical statistical problem. In the case now to
be considered our actual data do not consist of positive knowledge
of the constitutions either of S itself or of other series more or
less resembling S, but only of the frequency of the characteristic in
actually observed sets of selections, great or small, either from S itself
or from other series more or less resembling S.
Thus in the most general case our inquiry falls into two parts.
We are given the observed frequency in statistical sets selected from
S1, S2, etc., respectively. The first part of our inquiry is the problem of
arguing from these observed frequencies to the probable constitutions
of S1, S2, etc., i.e. of determining the values of f(x)/R(x, S1, f, h)  h,
etc.; we may call this part the statistical problem. The second part of
our inquiry is the problem of arguing from the probable constitutions
of S1, S2, etc., to the probable constitution of S, where S, S1, S2
resemble one another more or less, and we have to determine whether
the differences are or are not relevant to our inquiry; we may call this
part the inductive problem.
Now if the observed statistical sets are made up of random
instances of S1, S2, etc., we can argue in certain conditions from
the observed frequencies to the probable constitutions of the series,
out of which the random selections have been made, by an inverse
application of Bernoulli’s Theorem on the lines explained in Chapter
XXXI. Moreover, if the series S1, S2, etc., are finite series and
the observed selections cover a great part of their members, we
can reach an at least approximate conclusion without raising all
the theoretical difficulties or satisfying all the conditions of Chapter
XXXI. The commonly received opinions as to the bearing of the
observed frequencies in a random sample on the constitution of the
universe out of which the sample is drawn, though generally stated
too precisely and without sufficient insistence on the assumptions they
involve, our actual evidence not warranting in general more than an
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 474
approximate result, are not, I think, fundamentally erroneous. The
most usual error in modern method consists in treating too lightly
what I have termed above the inductive problem, i.e. the problem
of passing from the series S1, S2, etc., of which we have observed
samples, to the series S of which we have not observed samples.
Let us, then, assume that we have ascertained p1, p2, etc.,
with more or less exactness, by examining either all the instances
of the series S1, S2, etc., or random selections from them, i.e.
f(x)/R(x, S1, f, h)  h = p1, etc. This can be expressed for short by
saying that the series S1, S2, etc., are subject to probable-frequencies
p1, p2, etc., for the characteristic f. Our problem is to infer from
this the probable-frequency p of the unexamined series S. The class
characteristics of the series S1, S2, etc., will be partly the same and
partly different. Using the terminology of Part III. we may term the
class characteristics which are common to all of them the Positive
Analogy, and the class characteristics which are not common to all of
them the Negative Analogy.
Now, if the observed or inferred probable-frequencies of the series
S1, S2, are to form the basis of a statistical induction, they must show
a stable value; that is to say, either we must have p1 = p2 = etc.,
or at least p1, p2, etc., must be stably grouped about their mean
value. Our next task, therefore, must be to discover whether the
probable-frequencies p1, p2, etc., display a significant stability. It is
the great merit of Lexis that he was the first to investigate the
problem of stability and to attempt its measurement. For, until a
primâ facie case has been established for the existence of a stable
probable-frequency, we have but a flimsy basis for any statistical
induction at all; indeed we are limited to the class of case where the
instance under inquiry is a member of identically the same series as
that from which our samples were drawn, i.e. where S = S1, which in
social and scientific inquiries is seldom the case.
What is the meaning of the assertion that p1, p2, etc., are stably
grouped about their mean value? The answer is not simple and
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 475
not perfectly precise. We could propound various formulae for
the measurement of stability and dispersion, respectively, and the
problem of translating the conception of stability, which is not
quantitatively precise, into a numerical formula involves an arbitrary
or approximative element. For practical purposes, however, I doubt
if it is possible to improve on Lexis’s measure of stability Q, the
mathematical definition of which has been given above on p. 455.
Lexis describes the stability as subnormal, normal, or supernormal
according as Q is less than, equal to, or greater than 1. This is too
precise, and it is better perhaps to say that the stability about the
mean is normal if the dispersion is such as would not be improbable
à priori, if we had assumed that the members of S1, S2, etc., were
obtained by random selection out of a single universe U, that it is
subnormal if the dispersion is less than one would have expected on
the same hypothesis, and that it is supernormal if the dispersion is
greater than one would have expected.
Let us suppose that we find that on this definition p1, p2, etc.,
are stable about p, and let us postpone consideration of the cases of
subnormal or supernormal dispersion. This is equivalent to saying
that the frequencies of S1, S2, etc., are within limits which we should
expect à priori, if we had knowledge relative to which their members
were chosen at random from a universe U of which the frequency
was p for the characteristic under inquiry. We next seek to extend
this result to the unexamined series S and to justify anticipations
about it on the basis of the members of S also being chosen at
random from the universe U. This leads us to the strictly inductive
part of our inquiry.
The class characteristics of the several series S1, S2, etc., will
be partly the same and partly different, those that are the same
constituting the positive analogy and those that are different
constituting the negative analogy, as stated above. The series S will
share part of the positive analogy. The argument for assimilating
the properties of S, in relation to the characteristic under inquiry, to
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 476
the properties of S1, S2, etc., in relation to this characteristic depends
on the differences between S, S1, S2, etc., being irrelevant in this
particular connection. The method of strengthening this argument
seems to me to be the same as the general inductive method discussed
in Part III. and to present the same, but not greater, difficulties.
In general this inductive part of our inquiry will be best advanced
by classifying the aggregate series of instances with which we are
presented in such a way as to analyse most clearly the significant
positive and negative analogies, to group them, that is to say, into
sub-series S1, S2, etc., which show the most marked and definite
class characteristics. Our knowledge of the differences between the
particular observed instances which constitute our original data will
suggest to us one or more principles of classification, such that the
members of each sub-series all have in common some set of positive
or negative characteristics, not all of which are shared in common by
all the members of any of the other sub-series. That is to say, we
classify our whole set of instances into a series of series S1, S2, etc.,
which have frequencies f1, f2, etc., for the characteristic under inquiry;
and then again we classify them by another principle or criterion of
classification into a second series of series S
0
1
, S
0
2
, etc., with frequencies
f
0
1
, f0
2
, etc.; and so on, so far as our knowledge of the possible relevant
differences between the instances extends; the whole result being then
summed up in a statement of the positive and negative analogies of
the series of series. If we then find that all the frequencies f1, f2, etc.,
f
0
1
, f0
2
etc., are stable about a value p, and if, on the basis of the
above positive and negative analogies, we have a normal inductive
argument for assimilating the unexamined series S to the examined
series S1, S2, etc., S
0
1
, S
0
2
, etc., in respect of the characteristic under
inquiry, in this case we have, not conclusive grounds, but grounds of
some weight for asserting the probability p, that an instance taken at
random from S will have the characteristic in question.
Let me recapitulate the two essential stages of the argument.
We first find that the observed frequencies in a set of series are
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 477
such as would have been not improbable à priori if, relative to our
knowledge, these series had all been made up of random members
of the same universe U; and we next argue that the positive and
negative analogies of this set of series furnish an inductive argument
of some weight for supposing that a further unexamined series S
resembles the former series in having a frequency for the characteristic
under inquiry such as would have been not improbable à priori if,
relative to our knowledge, S was also made up of random members of
the hypothetical universe U.
7. It is very perplexing to decide how far an argument of this
character involves any new and theoretically distinct difficulties or
assumptions, beyond those already admitted as inherent in Universal
Induction. I believe that the foregoing analysis is along the right lines
and that it carries the inquiry a good deal further than it has been
carried hitherto. But it is not conclusive, and I must leave to others
its more exact elucidation.
There is, however, a little more to be said about the half-felt
reasons which, in my judgment, recommend to common sense some at
least of the scientific (or semi-scientific) arguments which run along
the above lines. In expressing these reasons I shall be content to use
language which is not always as precise as it ought to be.
I gave in Chapter XXIV. §§ 7–9 an interpretation of what is
meant by an ‘objectively chance’ occurrence, in the sense in which
the results of a game, such as roulette, may be said to be governed
by ‘objective chance.’ This interpretation was as follows: “An event
is due to objective chance if in order to predict it, or to prefer
it to alternatives, at present equiprobable, with any high degree of
probability, it would be necessary to know a great many more facts
of existence about it than we actually do know, and if the addition of
a wide knowledge of general principles would be little use.” The ideal
instance of this is the game of chance; but there are other examples
afforded by science in which these conditions are fulfilled with more
or less perfection. Now the field of statistical induction is the class of
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 478
phenomena which are due to the combination of two sets of influences,
one of them constant and the other liable to vary in accordance with
the expectations of objective chance,—Quetelet’s ‘permanent causes’
modified by ‘accidental causes.’ In social and physical statistics
the ultimate alternatives are not as a rule so perfectly fixed, nor
the selection from them so purely random, as in the ideal game of
chance. But where, for example, we find stability in the statistics
of crime, we could explain this by supposing that the population
itself is stably constituted, that persons of different temperaments are
alive in proportions more or less the same from year to year, that
the motives for crime are similar, and that those who come to be
influenced by these motives are selected from the population at large
in the same kind of way. Thus we have stable causes at work leading
to the several alternatives in fixed proportions, and these are modified
by random influences. Generally speaking, for large classes of social
statistics we have a more or less stable population including different
kinds of persons in certain proportions and on the other hand sets of
environments; the proportions of the different kinds of persons, the
proportions of the different kinds of environments, and the manner of
allotting the environments to the persons vary in a random manner
from year to year (or, it may be, from district to district). In all such
cases as these, however, prediction beyond what has been observed is
clearly open to sources of error which can be neglected in considering,
for example, games of chance;—our so-called ‘permanent’ causes are
always changing a little and are liable at any moment to radical
alteration.
Thus the more closely that we find the conditions in scientific
examples assimilated to those in games of chance, the more confidently
does common sense recommend this method. The rather surprising
frequency with which we find apparent stability in human statistics
may possibly be explained, therefore, if the biological theory of
Mendelism can be established. According to this theory the qualities
apparent in any generation of a given race appear in proportions
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 479
which are determined by methods very closely analogous to those of
a game of chance. To take a specific example (I am giving not the
correct theory of sex but an artificially simplified form of it), suppose
there are two kinds of spermatozoa and two kinds of ova and of
the four possible kinds of union two produce males and two females,
then if the kinds of spermatozoa and ova exist in equal numbers and
their union is determined by random considerations in precisely the
same sense in which a game of chance such as roulette depends upon
random considerations, we should expect the observed proportions
to vary from equality, as indeed they do, in the same manner as
variations from equality of red and black occur at roulette.*
If
the sphere of influence of Mendelian considerations is wide, we have
both an explanation in part of what we observe and also a large
opportunity in future of using with profit the methods of statistical
analysis.
This is all familiar. This is the way in which in fact we do think
and argue. The inquiry as to how far it is covered by the abstract
analysis of the preceding paragraphs, and by what logical principle
the use of this analysis can be justified as rational, I have pushed as
far as I can. It deserves a profounder study than logicians have given
it in the past.
8. Two subsidiary questions remain to be mentioned. The first
of these relates to the character of series which, in the terminology of
Lexis, show a subnormal or supernormal stability; for I have pressed
on to the conclusion of the argument on the assumption that the
stabilities are normal. Subnormal stability conceals two types: the
one in which there is really no stability at all and the results are
in fact chaotic; and the other in which there is mutual dependence
*The fluctuations in the proportion of the sexes which, as is well known, is
not in fact one of equality, correspond, as Lexis has shown, to what one would
expect in a game of chance with an astonishing exactitude. But it is difficult
to find any other example, amongst natural or social phenomena, in which his
criteria of stability are by any means as equally well satisfied.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 480
between the successive instances of such a kind that they tend to
resemble one another so that any divergence from the normal tends
to accentuate itself. Super-*normal stability corresponds in the other
direction to the second of these two types; that is to say, there
is mutual dependence of a regulative kind between the successive
instances which tends to prevent the frequency from swinging away
from its mean value. The case, where the dog was fed with scraps
when he looked thin and not fed when he looked fat, illustrated
this. The typical example of this type is where balls are drawn from
urns, containing black and white balls in certain proportions and not
replaced; so that every time a black ball is drawn the next ball is
more likely than before to be white, and there is a tendency to redress
any excess of either colour beyond the proper proportions. Possibly
the aggregate annual rainfall may afford a further illustration.
Where there is no stability at all and the frequencies are chaotic,
the resulting series can be described as ‘non-statistical.’ Amongst
‘statistical series,’ we may term ‘independent series’ those of which
the instances are independent and the stability normal, and ‘organic
series,’ those of which the instances are mutually dependent and the
stability abnormal, whether in excess or in defect. ‘Organic series’
have been incidentally discussed elsewhere in this volume. I shall
not pursue them further now, because I do not think that they
introduce any new theoretical difficulty into the general problem of
statistical inference; although the problem of fitting them into the
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 481
general theoretical scheme is not easy.*
9. The second question is concerned with the relation between
the Inductive Correlation, which has been the subject-matter of this
chapter, and the Correlation Coefficient or, as I should prefer to call
it, the Quantitative Correlation, with which recent English statistical
theory has chiefly occupied itself. I do not propose to discuss this
theory in detail, because I suspect that it is much more concerned,
at any rate in its present form, with statistical description than with
statistical induction. The transition from defining the ‘correlation
coefficient’ as an algebraical expression to its employment for purposes
of inference is very far from clear even in the work of the best
and most systematic writers on the subject, such as Mr. Yule and
Professor Bowley.
*The following more precise definitions bring these ideas into line with what
has gone before: consider the terms a1, a2, . . . an of a series s(x); let ‘ar is g’
= gr and let gr/h = pr, where h is our data. Then, if gr/gs . . . gt . . . h = pr
for all values of r, s, . . . , t . . ., the terms of the series are independent relative
to h. If p1 = p2 = . . . = p the terms are uniform. If the terms are both
independent and uniform, the series may be called an independent Bernoullian
series, subject to a Bernoullian probability p. If the terms are independent but
not uniform, the series may be called an independent compound series, subject
to a compounded probability 1/nPpr. If the terms are not independent, the
series is an organic series.
The same terminology can then be applied to the series S1, S2, . . . Sn, regarded
as members of the series of series S(x). Let the frequencies of the series
for the characteristic under inquiry be x1, x2, . . . xn, and let x1/h = ?1(x1),
i.e. ?1(x1) is the probability of a frequency x1 in the first series. Then if
xr/xs . . . h = ?r(xr) for all values of r, s, etc., the frequencies are independent;
and if ?1(x) = ?2(x2) = . . . ?(x), the frequencies are stable. If the frequencies
are stable and independent, the series of series may be called Gaussian. If the
frequencies are stable and independent, and if in addition each individual series
is subject to a Bernoullian probability, the probable dispersion of the frequency
is normal and symmetrical. If the individual series are organic, the dispersion
of the frequencies may be normal, subnormal, or supernormal. If the series of
series is Gaussian, and the individual series Bernoullian, we have the type of
the perfect statistical series.
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 482
In the notation employed in the earlier part of this chapter
I have classified each examined instance a according as it did or
did not possess the characteristic f, i.e. satisfy the propositional
function f(x), or, in other words, according as f(a) was true or false.
Thus only two possible alternatives were contemplated, and f was not
considered as a quantitative characteristic which the instance could
satisfy in greater or less degree. Equally the common element in all
the instances, required to constitute them as instances for the purpose
of our statistical generalisation (or, as I have sometimes put it,
required to satisfy the condition of the generalisation), was regarded
as definite and unique and not capable of quantitative variation. That
is to say, all the instances satisfied a function ?(x), and the question
was, what proportion of them also satisfied the function f(x). A
typical example was that of sex-ratio,—?(x) being the birth of a
child and f(x) its sex, where there is no question of degree in either
?(x) or f(x).
It might be the case, however; that the characteristics under
examination were capable of degree or quantitative variation; for
example ?(x) might be the age of the mother and f(x) the
weight of the child at birth, in this case we should have a series
?1(x), ?2(x), etc., corresponding to the various age-periods of the
mothers, and a series f1(x), f2(x), etc., corresponding to the various
weights of the children. Now if we concentrated our attention on
?1(x) and f1(x) alone, i.e. on mothers of a particular age and the
proportions of their children which had a particular weight at birth,
we have a one-dimensional problem of the same kind as before; out
of all the instances which satisfy ?1(x) a certain proportion satisfy
?1(x) also. But clearly we can push our observations further and we
can take note what proportion of the instances which satisfy ?1(x)
satisfy f2(x), f3(x), and so on, respectively; and then we can do the
same as regards the instances which satisfy ?2(x), ?3(x), etc. The
total results of this two-dimensional set of observations can then be
tabulated in what is called a twofold correlation table. Thus if frs is
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 483
the proportion of instances satisfying ?s(x) which also satisfy fr(x)
we have a table as follows:
?1(x) ?2(x) ?3(x) . . .
f1(x) f11 f12 f13
f2(x) f21 f22 f23
f3(x) f31 f32 f33
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
We could, further, increase the complexity and completeness of
our observations to any required degree. For example we might
take account also of ?(x), the age of the father, and construct a
threefold table where frst is the proportion of instances satisfying
fr(x), ?s(x), ?t(x); and so on up to an n-fold table.
Clearly it is not necessary for the construction of tables of this kind
that f(x) and ?(x) should stand for degrees of the same quantitative
characteristic; they might be any set of exclusive alternatives; for
example, ?(x) might be the colour of the baby’s eyes, and f(x) its
Christian name.
But in order that the correlation table may be of any practical
interest for the purposes of inference, it is necessary—and this,
I think, is one of the critical assumptions of correlation—that
?1(x), ?2(x), . . . and also f1(x), f2(x), . . . should be arranged in an
order that is significant, i.e. such that we have some à priori reason
for expecting some connection to exist between the order of the ?’s
and the order of the f’s. The point of this will be illustrated
by concentrating our attention on the simplest type of case where
?(x) and f(x) are quantitative characteristics arranged in order
of magnitude. Now suppose it were the case that the younger
mothers tended to bear heavier babies, then, if ?1(x) ?2(x) are the
ages increasing upwards and f1(x) f2(x) the weights diminishing
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 484
downwards, f11 would probably be the greatest of the fr1’s and,
generally speaking, fr1 would be greater than fr+1,1; also f22 might be
the greatest of the fr2’s, and so on; so that the frequencies lying on
the diagonal of the table would be the greatest and the frequencies
would tend to be less the farther they lay from the diagonal. If we
had some reason à priori (i.e. based on our pre-existing knowledge), if
only a slight one, for supposing that there might be some connection
between the age of the mother and the weight of the baby, then, if in
a particular set of instances the frequencies were grouped about the
diagonal as suggested above, this might be taken as affording some
inductive support for the hypothesis.
Now the theory of correlation, as it is expounded in the text-books,
is almost entirely concerned with measuring how nearly the observed
frequencies are grouped about the diagonal of the table (though
the complete theory is not, of course, so restricted as this). The
‘coefficient of correlation’ is an algebraical formula which may be
regarded as measuring this phenomenon in a way that is sufficiently
satisfactory for all ordinary purposes. If it is defined thus, it is simply
a statistical description of a particular set of observations arranged in
a particular order. How can we make use of this coefficient for the
purposes of inference?
Dr. Bowley faces this problem a little more definitely than do
most statistical writers. Mr. Yule warns the student that the
problem exists,* but he does not himself attack it systematically or
do more than apply common sense to particular problems. So much
greater emphasis, however, has been laid hitherto on the mathematical
complications, that many statistical students hazily float from defining
the correlation coefficient as a statistical description to employing
*
Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, p. 191: “The coefficient of
correlation, like an average or a measure of dispersion, only exhibits in a
summary and comprehensible form one particular aspect of the facts on which
it is based, and the real difficulties arise in the interpretation of the coefficient
when obtained.”
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 485
it as a measure of the probability of a statistical generalisation as
to the association between quantitative variations of f(x) and ?(x)
respectively. If, for example, it is found in a particular set of
observations of mothers’ ages and babies’ weights that the frequencies
are closely ranged about the diagonal, this is considered a sufficiently
good reason for attributing probability to a generalisation as to the
‘correlation’ (i.e. tendency to quantitative correspondence) between
the age of the mother and the weight of the baby.
Dr. Bowley’s line of thought is as follows. He begins by defining the
correlation coefficient r merely as a statistical description (Elements
of Statistics, p. 354). He then shows (p. 355), as an illustration of the
nature of r, that if x and y are two variable quantities which depend
(more strictly, are known to depend) on other variables U, V, W in
such a way that
Xt = 1Ut + 2Ut + . . . + pUt + 1Vt + 2Vt + . . . + qVt
Yt = 1Ut + 2Ut + . . . + pUt + 1Wt + 2Wt + . . . + qWt
where 1Ut
, 2Ut
. . . 1Vt
, 2Vt
. . . 1Wt
, 2Wt
. . . are selected at random
each from an independent group of quantities (more strictly, are
relative to our data, random members of independent groups); then,
if we know à priori certain statistical coefficients descriptive of the
constitution of these groups, the value of r will probably tend towards
a certain value. So far we are on fairly safe, but not very fruitful,
ground. We have no basis for arguing backwards from the observed
value of r; but, provided we have rather extensive and peculiar
knowledge à priori as to how Xt and Yt are constituted, then we have
calculable expectations as to the limits within which the value of r,
namely the correlation coefficient between X and Y, will probably
turn out to lie, when we have observed it.
Dr. Bowley’s next move is more dubious. If the constitutions of the
independent groups are similar in a certain, statistical respect (i.e. if
they have the same standard deviations), then, Dr. Bowley concludes,
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 486
r =
p
(p + q)
, which “expressed in words shows that the correlation
coefficient tends to be the ratio of the number of causes common
in the genesis of two variables to the whole number of independent
causes on which each depends.” By this time the student’s mind,
unless anchored by a more than ordinary scepticism, will have been
well launched into a vague, fallacious sea.
Neglecting, however, the dictum just quoted, we find that the
second stage of the argument consists in showing that, if we have
a certain sort of knowledge à priori as to how our variables are
constituted, then the various possible values for the coefficients of
correlation, which would be yielded by actual sets of observations
made in prescribed conditions, will have, à priori, and before the
observations have been made, calculable probabilities, certain ranges
of values being probable and others improbable.
As a rule, however, we are not arguing from knowledge about
the variables to anticipations about their correlation coefficient; but
the other way round, that is from observations of their correlation
coefficients to theories about the nature of the variables. Dr. Bowley
perceives that this involves a third stage of the argument, and appeals
accordingly (p. 409) to “the difficult and elusive theory of inverse
probability.” He apprehends the difficulty but he does not pursue it;
and, like Mr. Yule, he really falls back for practical purposes on the
criteria of common sense, an expedient well enough in his case, but
not a universal safeguard.
The general argument from inverse probability to which Dr. Bowley
makes his vague appeal is doubtless on the following lines: If there
is no causal connection between the two sets of quantities, then
a close grouping of the frequencies about the diagonal would be
à priori improbable (and the greater the number of the individual
observations, the greater the improbability since, if the quantities are
independent, there is, then, all the more opportunity for ‘averaging
out’); therefore, inversely, if the frequencies do group themselves
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 487
about the diagonal, we have a presumption in favour of a causal
connection between the two sets of quantities.
But if the reader recalls our discussion of the principle of inverse
probability, he will remember that this conclusion cannot be reached
unless à priori, and quite apart from the observations in question,
we have some reason for thinking that there may be such a causal
connection between the quantities. The argument can only strengthen
a pre-existing presumption; it cannot create one. And in the absence
of reasons peculiar to the particular inquiry, we have no choice but
to fall back on the general methods and the general presumptions of
induction.
It is apparent that, where the correlation argument seems plausible,
some tacit assumption must have slipped in, if we return to the
case where our correlation table relates to the weights of the babies
and their Christian names. Either by accident or because we had
arranged the order of the Christian names to suit, it might happen
with a particular set of observations, even a fairly numerous set, that
the correlation coefficient was large. Yet on that evidence alone we
should hardly assert a generalisation connecting the weights of babies
with their Christian names.
The truth is that sensible investigators only employ the correlation
coefficient to test or confirm conclusions at which they have arrived
on other grounds. But that does not validate the crude way in which
the argument is sometimes presented, or prevent it from misleading
the unwary,—since not all investigators are sensible.
If we abandon the method of inverse probability in favour of the
less precise but better founded processes of induction, ‘quantitative
correlation,’ as I should like to term this particular branch of
statistical induction, is more complicated than, but not theoretically
distinct from, the kind of arguments which have occupied the
earlier paragraphs of this chapter. The character of the additional
complication can be described by saying that we are presented with a
two-dimensional problem instead of a one-dimensional problem. The
pt. v A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 488
mere existence of a particular correlation coefficient as descriptive
of a group of observations, even of a large group, is not in itself a
more conclusive or significant argument than the mere existence of
a particular frequency coefficient would be. Of course if we have a
considerable body of pre-existing knowledge relevant to the particular
inquiry, the calculation of a small number of correlation coefficients
may be crucial. But otherwise we must proceed as in the case of
frequency coefficients; that is to say we must have before us, in order
to found a satisfactory argument, many sets of observations, of which
the correlation coefficients display a significant stability in the midst
of variation in the non-essential class characteristics (i.e. those class
characteristics which our generalisation proposes to neglect) of the
different sets of observations.
10. I am now at the conclusion of an inquiry in which,
beginning with fundamental questions of logic, I have endeavoured to
push forward to the analysis of some of the actual arguments which
impress us as rational in the progress of knowledge and the practice
of empirical science. In writing a book of this kind the author must,
if he is to put his point of view clearly, pretend sometimes to a little
more conviction than he feels. He must give his own argument a
chance, so to speak, nor be too ready to depress its vitality with a
wet cloud of doubt. It is a heavy task to write on these problems;
and the reader will perhaps excuse me if I have sometimes pressed on
a little faster than the difficulties were overcome, and with decidedly
more confidence than I have always felt.
In laying the foundations of the subject of Probability, I have
departed a good deal from the conception of it which governed
the minds of Laplace and Quetelet and has dominated through
their influence the thought of the past century,—though I believe
that Leibniz and Hume might have read what I have written with
sympathy. But in taking leave of Probability, I should like to say
that, in my judgment, the practical usefulness of those modes of
inference, here termed Universal and Statistical Induction, on the
ch. xxxiii STATISTICAL INFERENCE 489
validity of which the boasted knowledge of modern science depends,
can only exist—and I do not now pause to inquire again whether such
an argument must be circular—if the universe of phenomena does
in fact present those peculiar characteristics of atomism and limited
variety which appear more and more clearly as the ultimate result to
which material science is tending:
fateare necessest
materiem quoque finitis differre figuris.
The physicists of the nineteenth century have reduced matter to the
collisions and arrangements of particles, between which the ultimate
qualitative differences are very few; and the Mendelian biologists
are deriving the various qualities of men from the collisions and
arrangements of chromosomes. In both cases the analogy with the
perfect game of chance is really present; and the validity of some
current modes of inference may depend on the assumption that it is to
material of this kind that we are applying them. Here, though I have
complained sometimes at their want of logic, I am in fundamental
sympathy with the deep underlying conceptions of the statistical
theory of the day. If the contemporary doctrines of Biology and
Physics remain tenable, we may have a remarkable, if undeserved,
justification of some of the methods of the traditional Calculus of
Probabilities. Professors of probability have been often and justly
derided for arguing as if nature were an urn containing black and
white balls in fixed proportions. Quetelet once declared in so many
words—“l’urne que nous interrogeons, c’est la nature.” But again in
the history of science the methods of astrology may prove useful to
the astronomer; and it may turn out to be true—reversing Quetelet’s
expression—that “La nature que nous interrogeons, c’est une urne.”

There is no opinion, however absurd or incredible, which has not been
maintained by some one of our philosophers.—Descartes.
The following Bibliography does not pretend to be complete,
but it contains a much longer list of what has been written about
Probability than can be found elsewhere. I have hesitated a little
before burdening this volume with the titles of many works, so few of
which are still valuable. But I was myself much hampered, when first
I embarked on the study of this subject, by the absence of guide-posts
to the scattered but extensive literature of the subject; and a list
which I drew up for my own convenience, without much attention to
bibliographical nicety or to exact uniformity in the style of entry, may
be useful to others.
It is rather an arbitrary matter to decide what to include and
what to exclude. Probability overlaps many other topics, and some
of the most important references to it are to be found in books, the
main topic of which is something else. On the other hand it would be
absurd to include every casual reference; and no useful purpose would
have been served by cataloguing the very numerous volumes dealing
with Insurance, Games of Chance, Statistics, Errors of Observation,
and Least Squares, which treat in detail these various applications of
the Theory of Probability. It has been a matter of some difficulty,
therefore, to know precisely where to draw the line. Where the main
subject of a book or paper is Probability proper, I have included it,
nearly regardless of my own view as to its importance, and have not
attempted to act as censor; but where Probability is not the main
subject or where an application of Probability is concerned, the chief
interest of which is solely in the application itself, I have only included
the entry where I think it important, intrinsically or historically or
from the celebrity of the author. In particular, the existence of

A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY 492
Professor Mansfield Merriman’s very extensive bibliography, published
in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy for 1877, has made it
possible to deal very lightly (and to the extent of but few entries) with
the inordinately large literature of Least Squares. This list comprises
408 titles of writings relating to the Method of Least Squares and
the theory of accidental errors of observation, and is sufficiently
exhaustive so far as relates to memoirs on this topic published before
1877.
Of bibliographical sources for Probability proper, Todhunter’s
History of the Mathematical Theory of Probability and Laurent’s
Calcul des probabilités are alone important. Of mathematical works
published before the time of Laplace, Todhunter’s list, and also his
commentary and analysis, are complete and exact,—a work of true
learning, beyond criticism. The bibliographical catalogue at the
conclusion of Laurent’s Calcul (published in 1873) is the longest list
published hitherto of general works on Probability. But it is unduly
swollen by the inclusion of numerous items on Insurance and Errors
of Observation, the bearing of which on Probability is very slight;*
it
is chiefly mathematical in bias; and it is now nearly fifty years old.
I have not read all these books myself, but I have read more of
them than it would be good for any one to read again. There are
here enumerated many dead treatises and ghostly memoirs. The list
is too long, and I have not always successfully resisted the impulse
to add to it in the spirit of a collector. There are not above a
hundred of these which it would be worth while to preserve,—if only
it were securely ascertained which these hundred are. At present a
bibliographer takes pride in numerous entries; but he would be a
more useful fellow, and the labours of research would be lightened,
if he could practise deletion and bring into existence an accredited
Index Expurgatorius. But this can only be accomplished by the slow
mills of the collective judgment of the learned; and I have already
*Laurent’s list contains 310 titles, of which I have excluded 174 from my list
as being insufficiently relevant.

indicated my own favourite authors in copious footnotes to the main
body of the text.
The list is long; yet there is, perhaps, no subject of equal
importance and of equal fascination to men’s minds on which so
little has been written. It is now fifty-five years since Dr. Venn,
still an accustomed figure in the streets and courts of Cambridge,
first published his Logic of Chance; yet amongst systematic works
in the English language on the logical foundations of Probability my
Treatise is next to his in chronological order.
The student will find many famous names here recorded. The
subject has preserved its mystery, and has thus attracted the notice,
profound or, more often, casual, of most speculative minds. Leibniz,
Pascal, Arnauld, Huygens, Spinoza, Jacques and Daniel Bernoulli,
Hume, D’Alembert, Condorcet, Euler, Laplace, Poisson, Cournot,
Quetelet, Gauss, Mill, Boole, Tchebychef, Lexis, and Poincaré, to
name those only who are dead, are catalogued below.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE.
In compiling the following pages, my object has been to
notice particularly several points in the principles of algebra
and geometry, which have not obtained their due importance
in our elementary works on these sciences. There are two
classes of men who might be benefited by a work of this kind,
viz., teachers of the elements, who have hitherto confined
their pupils to the working of rules, without demonstration,
and students, who, having acquired some knowledge under
this system, find their further progress checked by the insufficiency
of their previous methods and attainments. To
such it must be an irksome task to recommence their studies
entirely; I have therefore placed before them, by itself, the
part which has been omitted in their mathematical education,
presuming throughout in my reader such a knowledge
of the rules of algebra, and the theorems of Euclid, as is
usually obtained in schools.
It is needless to say that those who have the advantage of
University education will not find more in this treatise than
a little thought would enable them to collect from the best
works now in use [1831], both at Cambridge and Oxford. Nor
do I pretend to settle the many disputed points on which I
have necessarily been obliged to treat. The perusal of the
opinions of an individual, offered simply as such, may excite
many to become inquirers, who would otherwise have been
workers of rules and followers of dogmas. They may not
ultimately coincide in the views promulgated by the work
on the study of mathematics. vi
which first drew their attention, but the benefit which they
will derive from it is not the less on that account. I am not,
however, responsible for the contents of this treatise, further
than for the manner in which they are presented, as most of
the opinions here maintained have been found in the writings
of eminent mathematicians.
It has been my endeavor to avoid entering into the purely
metaphysical part of the difficulties of algebra. The student
is, in my opinion, little the better for such discussions,
though he may derive such conviction of the truth of results
by deduction from particular cases, as no `a priori reasoning
can give to a beginner. In treating, therefore, on the negative
sign, on impossible quantities, and on fractions of the
form 0
0
, etc., I have followed the method adopted by several
of the most esteemed continental writers, of referring the
explanation to some particular problem, and showing how
to gain the same from any other. Those who admit such
expressions as -a,
v
-a,
0
0
, etc., have never produced any
clearer method; while those who call them absurdities, and
would reject them altogether, must, I think, be forced to
admit the fact that in algebra the different species of contradictions
in problems are attended with distinct absurdities,
resulting from them as necessarily as different numerical results
from different numerical data. This being granted, the
whole of the ninth chapter of this work may be considered
as an inquiry into the nature of the different misconceptions,
which give rise to the various expressions above alluded to.
To this view of the question I have leaned, finding no other
author’s preface. vii
so satisfactory to my own mind.
The number of mathematical students, increased as it
has been of late years, would be much augmented if those
who hold the highest rank in science would condescend to
give more effective assistance in clearing the elements of the
difficulties which they present. If any one claiming that title
should think my attempt obscure or erroneous, he must share
the blame with me, since it is through his neglect that I have
been enabled to avail myself of an opportunity to perform a
task which I would gladly have seen confided to more skilful
hands.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON THE NATURE AND OBJECTS
OF MATHEMATICS.
The Object of this Treatise is—(1) To point out to the student
of Mathematics, who has not the advantage of a tutor,
the course of study which it is most advisable that he should
follow, the extent to which he should pursue one part of the
science before he commences another, and to direct him as
to the sort of applications which he should make. (2) To
treat fully of the various points which involve difficulties and
which are apt to be misunderstood by beginners, and to describe
at length the nature without going into the routine of
the operations.
No person commences the study of mathematics without
soon discovering that it is of a very different nature from
those to which he has been accustomed. The pursuits to
which the mind is usually directed before entering on the
sciences of algebra and geometry, are such as languages and
history, etc. Of these, neither appears to have any affinity
with mathematics; yet, in order to see the difference
which exists between these studies,—for instance, history
and geometry,—it will be useful to ask how we come by
knowledge in each. Suppose, for example, we feel certain
of a fact related in history, such as the murder of Cæsar,
whence did we derive the certainty? how came we to feel
sure of the general truth of the circumstances of the narrative?
The ready answer to this question will be, that we have
on the study of mathematics. 2
not absolute certainty upon this point; but that we have the
relation of historians, men of credit, who lived and published
their accounts in the very time of which they write; that succeeding
ages have received those accounts as true, and that
succeeding historians have backed them with a mass of circumstantial
evidence which makes it the most improbable
thing in the world that the account, or any material part of
it, should be false. This is perfectly correct, nor can there be
the slightest objection to believing the whole narration upon
such grounds; nay, our minds are so constituted, that, upon
our knowledge of these arguments, we cannot help believing,
in spite of ourselves. But this brings us to the point to which
we wish to come; we believe that Cæsar was assassinated by
Brutus and his friends, not because there is any absurdity
in supposing the contrary, since every one must allow that
there is just a possibility that the event never happened: not
because we can show that it must necessarily have been that,
at a particular day, at a particular place, a successful adventurer
must have been murdered in the manner described, but
because our evidence of the fact is such, that, if we apply the
notions of evidence which every-day experience justifies us in
entertaining, we feel that the improbability of the contrary
compels us to take refuge in the belief of the fact; and, if
we allow that there is still a possibility of its falsehood, it is
because this supposition does not involve absolute absurdity,
but only extreme improbability.
In mathematics the case is wholly different. It is true that
the facts asserted in these sciences are of a nature totally dis-
nature and objects of mathematics. 3
tinct from those of history; so much so, that a comparison
of the evidence of the two may almost excite a smile. But
if it be remembered that acute reasoners, in every branch of
learning, have acknowledged the use, we might almost say
the necessity, of a mathematical education, it must be admitted
that the points of connexion between these pursuits
and others are worth attending to. They are the more so,
because there is a mistake into which several have fallen,
and have deceived others, and perhaps themselves, by clothing
some false reasoning in what they called a mathematical
dress, imagining that, by the application of mathematical
symbols to their subject, they secured mathematical argument.
This could not have happened if they had possessed a
knowledge of the bounds within which the empire of mathematics
is contained. That empire is sufficiently wide, and
might have been better known, had the time which has been
wasted in aggressions upon the domains of others, been spent
in exploring the immense tracts which are yet untrodden.
We have said that the nature of mathematical demonstration
is totally different from all other, and the difference
consists in this—that, instead of showing the contrary of the
proposition asserted to be only improbable, it proves it at
once to be absurd and impossible. This is done by showing
that the contrary of the proposition which is asserted is in
direct contradiction to some extremely evident fact, of the
truth of which our eyes and hands convince us. In geometry,
of the principles alluded to, those which are most commonly
used are—
on the study of mathematics. 4
I. If a magnitude be divided into parts, the whole is
greater than either of those parts.
II. Two straight lines cannot inclose a space.
III. Through one point only one straight line can be
drawn, which never meets another straight line, or which
is parallel to it.
It is on such principles as these that the whole of geometry
is founded, and the demonstration of every proposition
consists in proving the contrary of it to be inconsistent with
one of these. Thus, in Euclid, Book I., Prop. 4, it is shown
that two triangles which have two sides and the included angle
respectively equal are equal in all respects, by proving
that, if they are not equal, two straight lines will inclose a
space, which is impossible. In other treatises on geometry,
the same thing is proved in the same way, only the selfevident
truth asserted sometimes differs in form from that
of Euclid, but may be deduced from it, thus—
Two straight lines which pass through the same two
points must either inclose a space, or coincide and be
one and the same line, but they cannot inclose a space,
therefore they must coincide. Either of these propositions
being granted, the other follows immediately; it is, therefore,
immaterial which of them we use. We shall return to
this subject in treating specially of the first principles of
geometry.
Such being the nature of mathematical demonstration,
what we have before asserted is evident, that our assurance
of a geometrical truth is of a nature wholly distinct from
nature and objects of mathematics. 5
that which we can by any means obtain of a fact in history
or an asserted truth of metaphysics. In reality, our senses
are our first mathematical instructors; they furnish us with
notions which we cannot trace any further or represent in
any other way than by using single words, which every one
understands. Of this nature are the ideas to which we attach
the terms number, one, two, three, etc., point, straight line,
surface; all of which, let them be ever so much explained,
can never be made any clearer than they are already to a
child of ten years old.
But, besides this, our senses also furnish us with the
means of reasoning on the things which we call by these
names, in the shape of incontrovertible propositions, such as
have been already cited, on which, if any remark is made by
the beginner in mathematics, it will probably be, that from
such absurd truisms as “the whole is greater than its part,”
no useful result can possibly be derived, and that we might
as well expect to make use of “two and two make four.” This
observation, which is common enough in the mouths of those
who are commencing geometry, is the result of a little pride,
which does not quite like the humble operation of beginning
at the beginning, and is rather shocked at being supposed
to want such elementary information. But it is wanted, nevertheless;
the lowest steps of a ladder are as useful as the
highest. Now, the most common reflection on the nature of
the propositions referred to will convince us of their truth.
But they must be presented to the understanding, and reflected
on by it, since, simple as they are, it must be a mind
on the study of mathematics. 6
of a very superior cast which could by itself embody these
axioms, and proceed from them only one step in the road
pointed out in any treatise on geometry.
But, although there is no study which presents so simple
a beginning as that of geometry, there is none in which
difficulties grow more rapidly as we proceed, and what may
appear at first rather paradoxical, the more acute the student
the more serious will the impediments in the way of his
progress appear. This necessarily follows in a science which
consists of reasoning from the very commencement, for it is
evident that every student will feel a claim to have his objections
answered, not by authority, but by argument, and
that the intelligent student will perceive more readily than
another the force of an objection and the obscurity arising
from an unexplained difficulty, as the greater is the ordinary
light the more will occasional darkness be felt. To remove
some of these difficulties is the principal object of this Treatise.
We shall now make a few remarks on the advantages to
be derived from the study of mathematics, considered both
as a discipline for the mind and a key to the attainment
of other sciences. It is admitted by all that a finished or
even a competent reasoner is not the work of nature alone;
the experience of every day makes it evident that education
develops faculties which would otherwise never have manifested
their existence. It is, therefore, as necessary to learn
to reason before we can expect to be able to reason, as it is
to learn to swim or fence, in order to attain either of those
nature and objects of mathematics. 7
arts. Now, something must be reasoned upon, it matters
not much what it is, provided that it can be reasoned upon
with certainty. The properties of mind or matter, or the
study of languages, mathematics, or natural history, may be
chosen for this purpose. Now, of all these, it is desirable to
choose the one which admits of the reasoning being verified,
that is, in which we can find out by other means, such as
measurement and ocular demonstration of all sorts, whether
the results are true or not. When the guiding property of
the loadstone was first ascertained, and it was necessary to
learn how to use this new discovery, and to find out how far
it might be relied on, it would have been thought advisable
to make many passages between ports that were well known
before attempting a voyage of discovery. So it is with our
reasoning faculties: it is desirable that their powers should
be exerted upon objects of such a nature, that we can tell
by other means whether the results which we obtain are true
or false, and this before it is safe to trust entirely to reason.
Now the mathematics are peculiarly well adapted for this
purpose, on the following grounds:
1. Every term is distinctly explained, and has but one
meaning, and it is rarely that two words are employed to
mean the same thing.
2. The first principles are self-evident, and, though derived
from observation, do not require more of it than has
been made by children in general.
3. The demonstration is strictly logical, taking nothing
for granted except the self-evident first principles, resting
on the study of mathematics. 8
nothing upon probability, and entirely independent of authority
and opinion.
4. When the conclusion is attained by reasoning, its truth
or falsehood can be ascertained, in geometry by actual measurement,
in algebra by common arithmetical calculation.
This gives confidence, and is absolutely necessary, if, as was
said before, reason is not to be the instructor, but the pupil.
5. There are no words whose meanings are so much alike
that the ideas which they stand for may be confounded. Between
the meanings of terms there is no distinction, except
a total distinction, and all adjectives and adverbs expressing
difference of degrees are avoided. Thus it may be necessary
to say, “A is greater than B;” but it is entirely unimportant
whether A is very little or very much greater than B.
Any proposition which includes the foregoing assertion will
prove its conclusion generally, that is, for all cases in which
A is greater than B, whether the difference be great or little.
Locke mentions the distinctness of mathematical terms, and
says in illustration: “The idea of two is as distinct from the
idea of three as the magnitude of the whole earth is from that
of a mite. This is not so in other simple modes, in which it
is not so easy, nor perhaps possible for us to distinguish between
two approaching ideas, which yet are really different;
for who will undertake to find a difference between the white
of this paper, and that of the next degree to it?”
These are the principal grounds on which, in our opinion,
the utility of mathematical studies may be shown to rest, as
a discipline for the reasoning powers. But the habits of mind
nature and objects of mathematics. 9
which these studies have a tendency to form are valuable in
the highest degree. The most important of all is the power
of concentrating the ideas which a successful study of them
increases where it did exist, and creates where it did not.
A difficult position, or a new method of passing from one
proposition to another, arrests all the attention and forces
the united faculties to use their utmost exertions. The habit
of mind thus formed soon extends itself to other pursuits,
and is beneficially felt in all the business of life.
As a key to the attainment of other sciences, the use
of the mathematics is too well known to make it necessary
that we should dwell on this topic. In fact, there is not in
this country any disposition to under-value them as regards
the utility of their applications. But though they are now
generally considered as a part, and a necessary one, of a
liberal education, the views which are still taken of them as
a part of education by a large proportion of the community
are still very confined.
The elements of mathematics usually taught are contained
in the sciences of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and
trigonometry. We have used these four divisions because
they are generally adopted, though, in fact, algebra and geometry
are the only two of them which are really distinct.
Of these we shall commence with arithmetic, and take the
others in succession in the order in which we have arranged
them.
CHAPTER II.
ON ARITHMETICAL NOTATION.
THE first ideas of arithmetic, as well as those of other sciences,
are derived from early observation. How they come
into the mind it is unnecessary to inquire; nor is it possible
to define what we mean by number and quantity. They are
terms so simple, that is, the ideas which they stand for are so
completely the first ideas of our mind, that it is impossible
to find others more simple, by which we may explain them.
This is what is meant by defining a term; and here we may
say a few words on definitions in general, which will apply
equally to all sciences.
Definition is the explaining a term by means of others,
which are more easily understood, and thereby fixing its
meaning, so that it may be distinctly seen what it does imply,
as well as what it does not. Great care must be taken
that the definition itself is not a tacit assumption of some
fact or other which ought to be proved. Thus, when it is
said that a square is “a four-sided figure, all whose sides
are equal, and all whose angles are right angles,” though no
more is said than is true of a square, yet more is said than
is necessary to define it, because it can be proved that if a
four-sided figure have all its sides equal, and one only of its
angles a right angle, all the other angles must be right angles
also. Therefore, in making the above definition, we do,
in fact, affirm that which ought to be proved. Again, the
on arithmetical notation. 11
above definition, though redundant in one point, is, strictly
speaking, defective in another, for it omits to state whether
the sides of the figure are straight lines or curves. It should
be, “a square is a four-sided rectilinear figure, all of whose
sides are equal, and one of whose angles is a right angle.”
As the mathematical sciences owe much, if not all, of
the superiority of their demonstrations to the precision with
which the terms are defined, it is most essential that the beginner
should see clearly in what a good definition consists.
We have seen that there are terms which cannot be defined,
such as number and quantity. An attempt at a definition
would only throw a difficulty in the student’s way, which is
already done in geometry by the attempts at an explanation
of the terms point, straight line, and others, which are to be
found in treatises on that subject. A point is defined to be
that “which has no parts, and which has no magnitude;” a
straight line is that which “lies evenly between its extreme
points.” Now, let any one ask himself whether he could have
guessed what was meant, if, before he began geometry, any
one had talked to him of “that which has no parts and which
has no magnitude,” and “the line which lies evenly between
its extreme points,” unless he had at the same time mentioned
the words “point” and “straight line,” which would
have removed the difficulty? In this case the explanation is
a great deal harder than the term to be explained, which
must always happen whenever we are guilty of the absurdity
of attempting to make the simplest ideas yet more simple.
A knowledge of our method of reckoning, and of writing
on the study of mathematics. 12
down numbers, is taught so early, that the method by which
we began is hardly recollected. Few, therefore, reflect upon
the very commencement of arithmetic, or upon the simplicity
and elegance with which calculations are conducted. We
find the method of reckoning by ten in our hands, we hardly
know how, and we conclude, so natural and obvious does it
seem, that it came with our language, and is a part of it; and
that we are not much indebted to instruction for so simple a
gift. It has been well observed, that if the whole earth spoke
the same language, we should think that the name of any
object was not a mere sign chosen to represent it, but was
a sound which had some real connexion with the thing; and
that we should laugh at, and perhaps persecute, any one who
asserted that any other sound would do as well if we chose
to think so. We cannot fall into this error, because, as it is,
we happen to know that what we call by the sound “horse,”
the Romans distinguished as well by that of “equus,” but
we commit a similar mistake with regard to our system of
numeration, because at present it happens to be received by
all civilised nations, and we do not reflect on what was done
formerly by almost all the world, and is done still by savages.
The following considerations will, perhaps, put this matter
on a right footing, and show that in our ideas of arithmetic
we have not altogether rid ourselves of the tendency to attach
ideas of mysticism to numbers which has prevailed so
extensively in all times.
We know that we have nine signs to stand for the first
nine numbers, and one for nothing, or zero. Also, that to
on arithmetical notation. 13
represent ten we do not use a new sign, but combine two
of the others, and denote it by 10, eleven by 11, and so
on. But why was the number ten chosen as the limit of
our separate symbols—why not nine, eight, or eleven? If we
recollect how apt we are to count on the fingers, we shall
be at no loss to see the reason. We can imagine our system
of numeration formed thus:—A man proceeds to count a
number, and to help the memory he puts a finger on the
table for each one which he counts. He can thus go as far
as ten, after which he must begin again, and by reckoning
the fingers a second time he will have counted twenty, and so
on. But this is not enough; he must also reckon the number
of times which he has done this, and as by counting on the
fingers he has divided the things which he is counting into
lots of ten each, he may consider each lot as a unit of its
kind, just as we say a number of sheep is one flock, twenty
shillings are one pound. Call each lot a ten. In this way
he can count a ten of tens, which he may call a hundred, a
ten of hundreds, or a thousand, and so on. The process of
reckoning would then be as follows:—Suppose, to choose an
example, a number of faggots is to be counted. They are first
tied up in bundles of ten each, until there are not so many
as ten left. Suppose there are seven over. We then count the
bundles of ten as we counted the single faggots, and tie them
up also by tens, forming new bundles of one hundred each
with some bundles of ten remaining. Let these last be six in
number. We then tie up the bundles of hundreds by tens,
making bundles of thousands, and find that there are five
on the study of mathematics. 14
bundles of hundreds remaining. Suppose that on attempting
to tie up the thousands by tens, we find there are not so
many as ten, but only four. The number of faggots is then
4 thousands, 5 hundreds, 6 tens, and 7.
The next question is, how shall we represent this number
in a short and convenient manner? It is plain that the way
to do this is a matter of choice. Suppose then that we distinguish
the tens by marking their number with one accent, the
hundreds with two accents, and the thousands with three.
We may then represent this number in any of the following
ways:— 7605
004
000, 6075004
000, 604
0005
007, 40005
006
07, the whole number
of ways being 24. But this is more than we want; one
certain method of representing a number is sufficient. The
most natural way is to place them in order of magnitude, either
putting the largest collection first or the smallest; thus
4
0005
006
07, or 7605
004
000. Of these we choose the first.
In writing down numbers in this way it will soon be apparent
that the accents are unnecessary. Since the singly
accented figure will always be the second from the right, and
so on, the place of each number will point out what accents
to write over it, and we may therefore consider each figure as
deriving a value from the place in which it stands. But here
this difficulty occurs. How are we to represent the numbers
3
0003
0
, and 40002
07 without accents? If we write them thus,
33 and 427, they will be mistaken for 303 and 4002
07. This
difficulty will be obviated by placing cyphers so as to bring
each number into the place allotted to the sort of collection
which it represents; thus, since the trebly accented letters,
on arithmetical notation. 15
or thousands, are in the fourth place from the right, and the
singly accented letters in the second, the first number may
be written 3030, and the second 4027. The cypher, which
plays so important a part in arithmetic that it was anciently
called the art of cypher, or cyphering, does not stand for any
number in itself, but is merely employed, like blank types in
printing, to keep other signs in those places which they must
occupy in order to be read rightly. We may now ask what
would have been the case if, instead of ten fingers, men had
had more or less. For example, by what signs would 4567
have been represented, if man had nine fingers instead of
ten? We may presume that the method would have been the
same, with the number nine represented by 10 instead of ten,
and the omission of the symbol 9. Suppose this number of
faggots is to be counted by nines. Tie them up in bundles of
nine, and we shall find 4 faggots remaining. Tie these bundles
again in bundles of nine, each of which will, therefore,
contain eighty-one, and there will be 3 bundles remaining.
These tied up in the same way into bundles of nine, each
of which contains seven hundred and twenty-nine, will leave
2 odd bundles, and, as there will be only six of them, the
process cannot be carried any further. If, then, we represent,
by 10
, a bundle of nine, or a nine, by 100 a nine of nines,
and so on, the number which we write 4567, must be written
60002
003
04. In order to avoid confusion, we will suffer the
accents to remain over all numbers which are not reckoned
in tens, while those which are so reckoned shall be written in
the common way. The following is a comparison of the way
on the study of mathematics. 16
in which numbers in the common system are written, and in
the one which we have just explained:
COUNTING BY
Tens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
Nines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 100 101 102 103 104
Tens 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 30 40 50
Nines 105 106 107 108 200 201 202 303 404 505
Tens 60 70 80 90 100
Nines 606 707 808 1001
00 1002
01
We will now write, in the common way, in the tens’ system,
the process which we went through in order to find how
to represent the number 4567 in that of the nines, thus:
9) 4567
9) 507 —rem. 4.
9) 56 —rem. 3.
9) 6 —rem. 2.
0 —rem. 6. Representation required, 60002
003
04.
The processes of arithmetic are the same in principle
whatever system of numeration is used. To show this, we
subjoin a question in each of the first four rules, worked
both in the common system, and in that of the nines. There
is the difference, that, in the first, the tens must be carried,
on arithmetical notation. 17

on the study of mathematics. 18
The student should accustom himself to work questions
in different systems of numeration, which will give him a
clearer insight into the nature of arithmetical processes than
he could obtain by any other method. When he uses a system
in which numbers are counted by a number greater than ten,
he will want some new symbols for figures. For example,
in the duodecimal system, where twelve is the number of
figures supposed, twelve will be represented by 100; there
must, therefore, be a distinct sign for ten and eleven: a nine
and six reversed, thus 9and 6, might be used for these.
CHAPTER III.
ELEMENTARY RULES OF ARITHMETIC.
As Soon as the beginner has mastered the notion of arithmetic,
he may be made acquainted with the meaning of the
algebraical signs +, -, ×, =, and also with that for division,
or the common way of representing a fraction. There
is no difficulty in these signs or in their use. Five minutes’
consideration will make the symbol 5 + 3 present as clear
an idea as the words “5 added to 3.” The reason why they
usually cause so much embarrassment is, that they are generally
deferred until the student commences algebra, when
he is often introduced at the same time to the representation
of numbers by letters, the distinction of known and unknown
quantities, the signs of which we have been speaking,
and the use of figures as the exponents of letters. Either of
these four things is quite sufficient at a time, and there is no
time more favorable for beginning to make use of the signs
of operation than when the habit of performing the operations
commences. The beginner should exercise himself in
putting the simplest truths of arithmetic in this new shape,
and should write such sentences as the following frequently:
2 + 7 = 9,
6 - 4 = 2,
1 + 8 + 4 - 6 = 4 + 2 + 1,
2 × 2 + 12 × 12 = 14 × 10 + 2 × 2 × 2.
on the study of mathematics. 20
These will accustom him to the meaning of the signs, just
as he was accustomed to the formation of letters by writing
copies. As he proceeds through the rules of arithmetic,
he should take care never to omit connecting each operation
with its sign, and should avoid confounding operations
together and considering them as the same, because they
produce the same result. Thus 4 × 7 does not denote the
same operation as 7×4, though the result of both is 28. The
first is four multiplied by seven, four taken seven times; the
second is seven multiplied by four, seven taken four times;
and that 4×7 = 7×4 is a proposition to be proved, not to be
taken for granted. Again, 1
7 × 4 and 4
7
are marks of distinct
operations, though their result is the same, as we shall show
in treating of fractions.
The examples which a beginner should choose for practice
should be simple and should not contain very large numbers.
The powers of the mind cannot be directed to two things at
once: if the complexity of the numbers used requires all the
student’s attention, he cannot observe the principle of the
rule which he is following. Now, at the commencement of
his career, a principle is not received and understood by the
student as quickly as it is explained by the instructor. He
does not, and cannot, generalise at all; he must be taught to
do so; and he cannot learn that a particular fact holds good
for all numbers unless by having it shown that it holds good
for some numbers, and that for those some numbers he may
substitute others, and use the same demonstration. Until he
can do this himself he does not understand the principle, and
elementary rules of arithmetic. 21
he can never do this except by seeing the rule explained and
trying it himself on small numbers. He may, indeed, and will,
believe it on the word of his instructor, but this disposition is
to be checked. He must be told, that whatever is not gained
by his own thought is not gained to any purpose; that the
mathematics are put in his way purposely because they are
the only sciences in which he must not trust the authority
of any one. The superintendence of these efforts is the real
business of an instructor in arithmetic. The merely showing
the student a rule by which he is to work, and comparing his
answer with a key to the book, printed for the preceptor’s
private use, to save the trouble which he ought to bestow
upon his pupil, is not teaching arithmetic any more than
presenting him with a grammar and dictionary is teaching
him Latin. When the principle of each rule has been well
established by showing its application to some simple examples
(and the number of these requisite will vary with the
intellect of the student), he may then proceed to more complicated
cases, in order to acquire facility in computation.
The four first rules may be studied in this way, and these
will throw the greatest light on those which succeed.
The student must observe that all operations in arithmetic
may be resolved into addition and subtraction; that
these additions and subtractions might be made with counters;
so that the whole of the rules consist of processes intended
to shorten and simplify that which would otherwise
be long and complex. For example, multiplication is continued
addition of the same number to itself—twelve times
on the study of mathematics. 22
seven is twelve sevens added together. Division is a continued
subtraction of one number from another; the division of
129 by 3 is a continued subtraction of 3 from 129, in order
to see how many threes it contains. All other operations
are composed of these four, and are, therefore, the result of
additions and subtractions only.
The following principles, which occur so continually in
mathematical operations that we are, at length, hardly sensible
of their presence, are the foundation of the arithmetical
rules:
I. We do not alter the sum of two numbers by taking away
any part of the first, if we annex that part to the second. This
may be expressed by signs, in a particular instance, thus:
(20 - 6) + (32 + 6) = 20 + 32.
II. We do not alter the difference of two numbers by increasing
or diminishing one of them, provided we increase or
diminish the other as much. This may be expressed thus, in
one instance:
(45 + 7) - (22 + 7) = 45 - 22,
(45 - 8) - (22 - 8) = 45 - 22.
III. If we wish to multiply one number by another, for
example 156 by 29, we may break up 156 into any number of
parts, multiply each of these parts by 29, and add the results.
For example, 156 is made up of 100, 50, and 6. Then
156 × 29 = 100 × 29 + 50 × 29 + 6 × 29.
elementary rules of arithmetic. 23
IV. The same thing may be done with the multiplier instead
of the multiplicand. Thus, 29 is made up of 18, 6,
and 5. Then
156 × 29 = 156 × 18 + 156 × 6 + 156 × 5.
V. If any two or more numbers be multiplied together, it
is indifferent in what order they are multiplied, the result is
the same. Thus,
10 × 6 × 4 × 3 = 3 × 10 × 4 × 6 = 6 × 10 × 4 × 3, etc.
VI. In dividing one number by another, for example 156
by 12, we may break up the dividend, and divide each of its
parts by the divisor, and then add the results. We may part
156 into 72, 60, and 24; this is expressed thus:
156
12
=
72
12
+
60
12
+
24
12
.
The same thing cannot be done with the divisor. It is not
true that
156
12
=
156
3
+
156
4
+
156
5
.
The student should discover the reason for himself.
A prime number is one which is not divisible by any other
number except 1. When the process of division can be performed,
it can be ascertained whether a given number is
divisible by any other number, that is, whether it is prime
or not. This can be done by dividing it by all the numbers
on the study of mathematics. 24
which are less than its half, since it is evident that it cannot
be divided into a number of parts, each of which is greater
than its half. This process would be laborious when the given
number is large; still it may be done, and by this means the
number itself may be reduced to its prime factors,
* as it is
called, that is, it may either be shown to be a prime number
itself or made up by multiplying several prime numbers together.
Thus, 306 is 34×9, or 2×17×9, or 2×17×3×3, and
has for its prime factors 2, 17, and 3, the latter of which is repeated
twice in its formation. When this has been done with
two numbers, we can then see whether they have any factors
in common, and, if that be the case, we can then find what
is called their greatest common measure or divisor ; that is,
the number made by multiplying all their common factors.
It is an evident truth that, if a number can be divided by
the product of two others, it can be divided by each of them.
If a number can be parted into an exact number of twelves,
it can be parted also into a number of sixes, twos, or fours.
It is also true that, if a number can be divided by any other
number, and the quotient can then be divided by a third
number, the original number can be divided by the product
of the other two. Thus, 144 is divisible by 2; the quotient, 72,
is divisible by 6; and the original number is divisible by 6×2
or 12. It is also true that, if two numbers are prime, their
product is divisible by no numbers except themselves. Thus,
*The factors of a number are those numbers by the multiplication
of which it is made.
elementary rules of arithmetic. 25
17×11 is divisible by no numbers except 17 and 11. Though
this is a simple proposition, its proof is not so, and cannot be
given to the beginner. From these things it follows that the
greatest common measure of two numbers (measure being an
old word for divisor) is the product of all the prime factors
which the two possess in common. For example, the numbers
90 and 100, which, when reduced to their prime factors,
are 2 × 5 × 3 × 3 and 2 × 2 × 5 × 5, have the common factors
2 and 5, and are divisible by 2 × 5, or 10. The quotients are
3 × 3 and 2 × 5, or 9 and 10, which have no common factor
remaining, and 2×5, or 10, is the greatest common measure
of 90 and 100. The same may be shown in the case of any
other numbers. But the method we have mentioned of resolving
numbers into their prime factors, being troublesome
to apply when the numbers are large, is usually abandoned
for another. It happens frequently that a method simple in
principle is laborious in practice, and the contrary.
When one number is divided by another, and its quotient
and remainder obtained, the dividend may be recovered
again by multiplying the quotient and divisor together,
and adding the remainder to the product. Thus 171 divided
by 27 gives a quotient 6 and a remainder 9, and 171 is made
by multiplying 27 by 6, and adding 9 to the product. That
is, 171 = 27 × 6 + 9. Now, from this equation it is easy
to show that every number which divides 171 and 27 also
divides 9, that is, every common measure of 171 and 27 is
also a common measure of 27 and 9. We can also show that
27 and 9 have no common measures which are not common
on the study of mathematics. 26
to 171 and 27. Therefore, the common measures of 171 and
27 are those, and no others, which are common to 27 and 9;
the greatest common measure of each pair must, therefore,
be the same, that is, the greatest common measure of a divisor
and dividend is also the greatest common measure of
the remainder and divisor. Now take the common process
for finding the greatest common measure of two numbers; for
example, 360 and 420, which is as follows, and abbreviate the
words greatest common measure into their initials g. c. m.:
360)420(1
360
60)360(6
360
0
From the theorem above enunciated it appears that
g. c. m. of 420 and 360 is g. c. m. of 60 and 360;
g. c. m. of 60 and 360 is 60;
because 60 divides both 60 and 360, and no number can have
a greater measure than itself. Thus may be seen the reason
of the common rule for finding the greatest common measure
of two numbers.
Every number which can be divided by another without
remainder is called a multiple of it. Thus, 12, 18, and 42 are
multiples of 6, and the last is a common multiple of 6 and 7,
because it is divisible both by 6 and 7. The only things
elementary rules of arithmetic. 27
which it is necessary to observe on this subject are, (1), that
the product of two numbers is a common multiple of both;
(2), that when the two numbers have a common measure
greater than 1, there is a common multiple less than their
product; (3), that when they have no common measure except
1, the least common multiple is their product. The first
of these is evident; the second will appear from an example.
Take 10 and 8, which have the common measure 2, since the
first is 2×5 and the second 2×4. The product is 2×2×4×5,
but 2 × 4 × 5 is also a common multiple, since it is divisible
by 2×4, or 8, and by 2×5, or 10. To find this common multiple
we must, therefore, divide the product by the greatest
common measure. The third principle cannot be proved in
an elementary way, but the student may convince himself of
it by any number of examples. He will not, for instance, be
able to find a common multiple of 8 and 7 less than 8 × 7
or 56.
CHAPTER IV.
ARITHMETICAL FRACTIONS.
When the student has perfected himself in the four rules,
together with that for finding the greatest common measure,
he should proceed at once to the subject of fractions. This
part of arithmetic is usually supposed to present extraordinary
difficulties; whereas, the fact is that there is nothing in
fractions so difficult, either in principle or practice, as the
rule for finding the greatest common measure. We would
recommend the student not to attend to the distinctions of
proper and improper, pure or mixed fractions, etc., as there
is no distinction whatever in the rules, which are common to
all these fractions.
When one number, as 56, is to be divided by another,
as 8, the process is written thus: 56
8
. By this we mean that
56 is to be divided into 8 equal parts, and one of these parts
is called the quotient. In this case the quotient is 7. But it is
equally possible to divide 57 into 8 equal parts; for example,
we can divide 57 feet into 8 equal parts, but the eighth part
of 57 feet will not be an exact number of feet, since 57 does
not contain an exact number of eights; a part of a foot will be
contained in the quotient 57
8
, and this quotient is therefore
called a fraction, or broken number. If we divide 57 into
56 and 1, and take the eighth part of each of these, whose
sum will give the eighth part of the whole, the eighth of
56 feet is 7 feet; the eighth of 1 foot is a fraction, which we
arithmetical fractions. 29
write 1
8
, and 57
8
is 7 + 1
8
, which is usually written 7 1
8
. Both
of these quantities 57
8
, and 7 1
8
, are called fractions; the only
difference is that, in the second, that part of the quotient
which is a whole number is separated from the part which is
less than any whole number.
There are two ways in which a fraction may be considered.
Let us take, for example, 5
8
. This means that 5 is to
be divided into 8 parts, and 5
8
stands for one of these parts.
The same length will be obtained if we divide 1 into 8 parts,
and take 5 of them, or find 1
8 × 5. To prove this let each of
the lines drawn below represent 1
8
of an inch; repeat 1
8
five
times, and repeat the same line eight times.
In each column is 1
8
th of an inch repeated 8 times; that is
one inch. There are, then, 5 inches in all, since there are five
columns. But since there are 8 lines, each line is the eighth
of 5 inches, or 5
8
, but each line is also 1
8
th of an inch repeated
5 times, or 1
8 × 5. Therefore, 5
8 =
1
8 × 5; that is, in order to
find 5
8
inches, we may either divide five inches into 8 parts,
and take one of them, or divide one inch into 8 parts, and
take five of them. The symbol 5
8
is made to stand for both
these operations, since they lead to the same result.
on the study of mathematics. 30
The most important property of a fraction is, that if
both its numerator and denominator are multiplied by the
same number, the value of the fraction is not altered; that
is, 3
5
is the same as 12
20 , or each part is the same when we
divide 12 inches into 20 parts, as when we divide 3 inches
into 5 parts. Again, we get the same length by dividing
1 inch into 20 parts, and taking 12 of them, which we
get by dividing 1 inch into 5 parts and taking 3 of them.
This hardly needs demonstration. Taking 12 out of 20 is
taking 3 out of 5, since for every 3 which 12 contains,
there is a 5 contained in 20. Every fraction, therefore,
admits of innumerable alterations in its form, without any
alteration in its value. Thus, 1
2 =
2
4 =
3
6 =
4
8 =
5
10 , etc.;
2
7 =
4
14 =
6
21 =
8
28 , etc.
On the same principle it is shown that the terms of a
fraction may be divided by any number without any alteration
of its value. There will now be no difficulty in reducing
fractions to a common denominator, in reducing a fraction
to its lowest terms; neither in adding nor subtracting fractions,
for all of which the rules are given in every book of
arithmetic.
We now come to a rule which presents more peculiar difficulties
in point of principle than any at which we have yet
arrived. If we could at once take the most general view of
numbers, and give the beginner the extended notions which
he may afterwards attain, the mathematics would present
comparatively few impediments. But the constitution of our
minds will not permit this. It is by collecting facts and prin-
arithmetical fractions. 31
ciples, one by one, and thus only, that we arrive at what are
called general notions; and we afterwards make comparisons
of the facts which we have acquired and discover analogies
and resemblances which, while they bind together the fabric
of our knowledge, point out methods of increasing its extent
and beauty. In the limited view which we first take of
the operations which we are performing, the names which
we give are necessarily confined and partial; but when, after
additional study and reflection, we recur to our former
notions, we soon discover processes so resembling one another,
and different rules so linked together, that we feel it
would destroy the symmetry of our language if we were to
call them by different names. We are then induced to extend
the meaning of our terms, so as to make two rules into one.
Also, suppose that when we have discovered and applied a
rule and given the process which it teaches a particular name,
we find that this process is only a part of one more general,
which applies to all cases contained under the first, and to
others besides. We have only the alternative of inventing a
new name, or of extending the meaning of the former one so
as to merge the particular process in the more general one
of which it is a part. Of this we can give an instance. We
began with reasoning upon simple numbers, such as 1, 2, 3,
20, etc. We afterwards divided these into parts, of which
we took some number, and which we called fractions, such
as 2
3
,
7
2
,
1
5
, etc. Now there is no number which may not
be considered as a fraction in as many different ways as we
please. Thus 7 is 14
2
or 21
3
, etc.; 12 is 144
12 ,
72
6
, etc. Our new
on the study of mathematics. 32
notion of fraction is, then, one which includes all our former
ideas of number, and others besides. It is then customary
to represent by the word number, not only our first notion
of it, but also the extended one, of which the first is only a
part. Those to which our first notions applied we call whole
numbers, the others fractional numbers, but still the name
number is applied to both 2 and 1
2
, 3 and 3
5
. The rule of
which we have spoken is another instance. It is called the
multiplication of fractional numbers. Now, if we return to
our meaning of the word multiplication, we shall find that
the multiplication of one fraction by another appears an absurdity.
We multiply a number by taking it several times and
adding these together. What, then, is meant by multiplying
by a fraction? Still, a rule has been found which, in applying
mathematics, it is necessary to use for fractions, in all cases
where multiplication would have been used had they been
whole numbers. Of this we shall now give a simple example.
Take an oblong figure (which is called a rectangle in geometry),
such as ABCD, and find the magnitudes of the sides
arithmetical fractions. 33
AB and BC in inches. Draw the line EF equal in length to
one inch, and the square G, each of whose sides is one inch. If
the lines AB and BC contain an exact number of inches, the
rectangle ABCD contains an exact number of squares, each
equal to G, and the number of squares contained is found by
multiplying the number of inches in AB by the number of
inches in BC. In the present case the number of squares is
3 × 4, or 12. Now, suppose another rectangle A0B0C
0D0
, of
which neither of the sides is an exact number of inches; suppose,
for example, that A0B0
is 2
3
of an inch, and that B0C
0
is
5
7
of an inch. We may show, by reasoning, that we can find
how much A0B0C
0D0
is of G by forming a fraction which has
the product of the numerators of 2
3
and 5
7
for its numerator,
and the product of their denominators for its denominator;
that is, that A0B0C
0D0
contains 10
21 of G. Here then appears a
connexion between the multiplication of whole numbers, and
the formation of a fraction, whose numerator is the product
of two numerators, and its denominator the product of the
corresponding denominators. These operations will always
on the study of mathematics. 34
come together, that is whenever a question occurs in which,
when whole numbers are given, those numbers are to be multiplied
together; when fractional numbers are given, it will
be necessary, in the same case, to multiply the numerator by
the numerator, and the denominator by the denominator,
and form the result into a fraction, as above.
This would lead us to suspect some connexion between
these two operations, and we shall accordingly find that when
whole numbers are formed into fractions, they may be multiplied
together by this very rule. Take, for example, the
numbers 3 and 4, whose product is 12. The first may be
written as 15
5
, and the second as 8
2
. Form a fraction from the
product of the numerators and denominators of these, which
will be 120
10 , which is 12, the product of 3 and 4.
From these considerations it is customary to call the fraction
which is produced from two others in the manner above
stated, the product of those two fractions, and the process
of finding the third fraction, multiplication. We shall always
find the first meaning of the word multiplication included in
the second, in all cases in which the quantities represented as
fractions are really whole numbers. The mathematics are not
the only branches of knowledge in which it is customary to
extend the meaning of established terms. Whenever we pass
from that which is simple to that which is complex, we shall
see the necessity of carrying our terms with us and enlarging
their meaning, as we enlarge our own ideas. This is the only
method of forming a language which shall approach in any
degree towards perfection; and more depends upon a well-
arithmetical fractions. 35
constructed language in mathematics than in anything else.
It is not that an imperfect language would deprive us of the
means of demonstration, or cramp the powers of reasoning.
The propositions of Euclid upon numbers are as rationally
established as any others, although his terms are deficient in
analogy, and his notation infinitely inferior to that which we
use. It is the progress of discovery which is checked by terms
constructed so as to conceal resemblances which exist, and
to prevent one result from pointing out another. The higher
branches of mathematics date the progress which they have
made in the last century and a half, from the time when the
genius of Newton, Leibnitz, Descartes, and Hariot turned
the attention of the scientific world to the imperfect mechanism
of the science. A slight and almost casual improvement,
made by Hariot in algebraical language, has been the foundation
of most important branches of the science.* The subject
of the last articles is of very great importance, and will often
recur to us in explaining the difficulties of algebraical
notation.

is equivalent to dividing 5
6
into 2 parts, and taking three such parts. Because 5
6
being
the same as 10
12 , or 1 divided into 12 parts and 10 of them
taken, the half of 10
12 is 5 of those parts, or 5
12 . Three times
this quantity will be 15 of those parts, or 15
12 , which is by our
rule the same as what we have called, 5
6 multiplied by 3
2
. But
*The mathematician will be aware that I allude to writing an equation
in the form x
2 + ax - b = 0; instead of x
2 + ax = b.
on the study of mathematics. 36
the same result arises from multiplying 3
2
by 5
6
, or dividing 3
2
into 6 parts and taking 5 of them. Therefore, we find that
3
2 multiplied by 5
6
is the same as 5
6 multiplied by 3
2
, or 3
2 ×
5
6 =
5
6 ×
3
2
. This proposition is usually considered as requiring no
proof, because it is received very early on the authority of a
rule in the elements of arithmetic. But it is not self-evident,
for the truth of which we appeal to the beginner himself,
and ask him whether he would have seen at once that 5
6
of
an apple divided into 2 parts and 3 of them taken, is the
same as 3
2
of an apple, or one apple and a-half divided into
six parts and 5 of them taken.
An extension of the same sort is made of the term division.
In dividing one whole number by another, for example,
12 by 2, we endeavor to find how many twos must be added
together to make 12. In passing from a problem which contains
these whole numbers to one which contains fractional
quantities, for example 3
4
and 2
5
, it will be observed that in
place of finding how many twos make 12, we shall have to
find into how many parts 2
5 must be divided, and how many
of them must be taken, so as to give 3
4
. If we reduce these
fractions to a common denominator, in which case they will
be 15
20 and 8
20 ; and if we divide the second into 8 equal parts,
each of which will be 1
20 , and take 15 of these parts, we shall
get 15
20 , or 3
4
. The fraction whose numerator is 15, and whose
denominator is 8, or 15
8
, will in these problems take the place
of the quotient of the two whole numbers. In the same manner
as before, it may be shown that this process is equivalent
to the division of one whole number by another, whenever
arithmetical fractions. 37
the fractions are really whole numbers; for example, 3 is 12
4
,
and 15 is 30
2
. If this process be applied to 30
2
and 12
4
, the
result is 120
24 , which is 5, or the same as 15 divided by 3. This
process is then, by extension, called division: 15
8
is called
the quotient of 3
4
divided by 2
5
, and is found by multiplying
the numerator of the first by the denominator of the second
for the numerator of the result, and the denominator of the
first by the numerator of the second for the denominator of
the result. That this process does give the same result as
ordinary division in all cases where ordinary division is applicable,
we can easily show from any two whole numbers,
for example, 12 and 2, whose quotient is 6. Now 12 is 36
3
,
and 2 is 10
5
, and the rule for what we have called division of
fractions will give as the quotient 180
30 , which is 6.
In all fractional investigations, when the beginner meets
with a difficulty, he should accustom himself to leave the notation
of fractions, and betake himself to their original definition.
He should recollect that 5
6
is 1 divided into 6 parts
and five of them taken, or the sixth part of 5, and he should
reason upon these suppositions, neglecting all rules until he
has established them in his own mind by reflexion on particular
instances. These instances should not contain large
numbers, and it will perhaps assist him if he reasons on some
given unit, for example a foot. Let AB be one foot, and divide
it into any number of equal parts (7 for example) by
the points C, D, E, F, G, and H. He must then recollect
that each of these parts is 1
7
of a foot; that any two of them
together are 2
7
of a foot; any 3, 3
7
, and so on. He should
on the study of mathematics. 38
then accustom himself, without a rule, to solve such questions
as the following, by observation of the figure, dividing
each part into several equal parts, if necessary; and he may
be well assured that he does not understand the nature of
fractions until such questions are easy to him.
What is 1
4
of 2
7
of a foot? What is 2
5
of 1
3
of 3
4
of a foot?
Into how many parts must 3
7
of a foot be divided, and how
many of them must be taken to produce 14
15 of a foot? What
is 1

1
7
of a foot? and so on.
CHAPTER V.
DECIMAL FRACTIONS.
It is a disadvantage attending rules received without a
knowledge of principles, that a mere difference of language
is enough to create a notion in the mind of a student that he
is upon a totally different subject. Very few beginners see
that in following the rule usually called practice, they are
working the same questions as were proposed in compound
multiplication;—that the rule of three is only an application
of the doctrine of fractions; that the rules known by the
name of commission, brokerage, interest, etc., are the same,
and so on. No instance, however, is more conspicuous than
that of decimal fractions, which are made to form a branch
of arithmetic as distinct from ordinary or vulgar fractions
as any two parts of the subject whatever. Nevertheless,
there is no single rule in the one which is not substantially
the same as the rule corresponding in the other, the difference
consisting altogether in a different way of writing the
fractions. The beginner will observe that throughout the
subject it is continually necessary to reduce fractions to a
common denominator: he will see, therefore, the advantage
of always using either the same denominator, or a set of
denominators, so closely connected as to be very easily
reducible to one another. Now of all numbers which can be
chosen the most easily manageable are 10, 100, 1000, etc.,
which are called decimal numbers on account of their con-
on the study of mathematics. 40
nexion with the number ten. All fractions, such as 75
100 ,
333
1000 ,
178699
10 , which have a decimal number for the denominator,
are called decimal fractions. Now a denominator of this
sort is known whenever the number of cyphers in it are
known; thus a decimal number with 4 cyphers can only
be 10,000, or ten thousand. We need not, therefore, write
the denominator, provided, in its stead, we put some mark
upon the numerator, by which we may know the number
of cyphers in the denominator. This mark is for our own
selection. The method which is followed is to point off
from the numerator as many figures as there are cyphers in
the denominator. Thus 17334
1000 is represented by 17.334; 229
1000
thus, .229. We might, had we so pleased, have represented
them thus, 173343
, 2293
; or thus, 173343, 2293, or in any
way by which we might choose to agree to recollect that
the denominator is 1 followed by 3 cyphers. In the common
method this difficulty occurs immediately. What shall be
done when there are not as many figures in the numerator
as there are cyphers in the denominator? How shall we
represent 88
10000 ? We must here extend our language a little,
and imagine some method by which, without essentially
altering the numerator, it may be made to show the number
of cyphers in the denominator. Something of the sort has
already been done in representing a number of tens, hundreds,
or thousands, etc.; for 5 thousands were represented
by 5000, in which, by the assistance of cyphers, the 5 is
made to stand in the place allotted to thousands. If, in the
present instance, we place cyphers at the beginning of the
decimal fractions. 41
numerator, until the number of figures and cyphers together
is equal to the number of cyphers in the denominator, and
place a point before the first cypher, the fraction 88
10000 will be
represented thus, .0088; by which we understand a fraction
whose numerator is 88, and whose denominator is a decimal
number containing four cyphers.
There is a close connexion between the manner of representing
decimal fractions, and the decimal notation for numbers.
Take, for example, the fraction 217.3426 or 2173426
10000 . You
will recollect that 2173426 is made up of 2000000+ 100000+
70000 + 3000 + 400 + 20 + 6. If each of these parts be divided
by 10000, and the quotient obtained or the fraction reduced
to its lowest terms, the result is as follows:
2173426
10000
= 200 + 10 + 7 +
3
10
+
4
100
+
2
1000
+
6
10000
.
We see, then, that in the fraction 217.3426 the first figure 2
counts two hundred; the second figure, 1, ten, and the third
7 units. It appears, then, that all figures on the left of the
decimal point are reckoned as ordinary numbers. But on
the right of that point we find the figure 3, which counts
for 3
10 ; 4, which counts for 4
100 ; 2, for 2
1000 ; and 6, for 6
10000 . It
appears therefore, that numbers on the right of the decimal
point decrease as they move towards the right, each number
being one-tenth of what it would have been had it come one
place nearer to the decimal point. The first figure on the
right hand of that point is so many tenths of a unit, the
second figure so many hundredths of a unit, and so on.
on the study of mathematics. 42
The learner should go through the same investigation
with other fractions, and should demonstrate by means of the
principles of fractions, generally, such exercises as the following,
until he is thoroughly accustomed to this new method
of writing fractions:
.68342 = .6 + .08 + .003 + .0004 + .00002,
or
68342
100000
=
6
10
+
8
100
+
3
1000
+
4
10000
+
2
100000
,
.00012 = .0001 + .00002 =
1
10000
+
2
100000
,
163.499 =
163429
1000
= 163
429
1000
=
1634
10
+
29
1000
=
16342
100
+
9
1000
, etc.
The rules of addition, subtraction, and multiplication
may now be understood. In addition and subtraction, the
keeping the decimal points under one another is equivalent
to reducing the fractions to a common denominator, as we
may show thus: Take two fractions, 1.5 and 2.125, or 15
10 and
2125
1000 , which, reducing the first to the denominator of the second,
may be written 1500
1000 and 2125
1000 . If we add the numerators
together, we find the sum of the fractions 3625
1000 , or 3.625
2125
1500
3625
2.125
1.5
3.625
The learner can now see the connexion of the rule given
decimal fractions. 43
for the addition of decimal fractions with that for the addition
of vulgar fractions. There is the same connexion between
the rules of subtraction. The principle of the rule of
multiplication is as follows: If two decimal numbers be multiplied
together, the product has as many cyphers as are in
both together. Thus 100 × 1000 = 100000, 10 × 100 = 1000,
etc. Therefore the denominator of the product, which is the
product of the denominators, has as many cyphers as are in
the denominators of both fractions, and since the numerator
of the product is the product of the numerators, the point
must be placed in that product so as to cut off as many decimal
places as are both in the multiplier and the multiplicand.
Thus:
13
100
×
12
10
=
156
1000
, or .13 × 1.2 = .156;
4
1000
×
6
100
=
24
100000
,
or .004 × .06 = .00024, etc.
It is a general rule, that wherever the number of figures falls
short of what we know ought to be the number of decimals,
the deficiency is made up by cyphers.
It may now be asked, whether all fractions can be reduced
to decimal fractions? It may be answered that they cannot.
It is a principle which is demonstrated in the science of
algebra,—that if a number be not divisible by a prime number,
no multiplication of that number, by itself, will make it
so. Thus 10 not being divisible by 7, neither 10 × 10, nor
on the study of mathematics. 44
10 × 10 × 10, etc., is divisible by 7. A consequence of this
is, that since 5 and 2 are the only prime numbers which will
divide 10, no fraction can be converted into a decimal unless
its denominator is made up of products, either of 5 or 2, or
of both combined, such as 5 × 2, 5 × 5 × 2, 5 × 5 × 5, 2 × 2,
etc. To show that this is the case, take any fraction with
such a denominator; for example, 13
5 × 5 × 5
. Multiply the
numerator and denominator by 2, once for every 5, which
is contained in the denominator, and the fraction will then
become
13 × 2 × 2 × 2
5 × 5 × 5 × 2 × 2 × 2
, or
2 × 2 × 2 × 13
10 × 10 × 10
,
which is 140
1000 , or .104. In a similar way, any fraction whose
denominator has no other factors than 2 or 5, can be reduced
to a decimal fraction. We first search for such a number as
will, when multiplied by the denominator, produce a decimal
number, and then multiply both the numerator and denominator
by that number.
No fraction which has any other factor in its denominator
can be reduced to a decimal fraction exactly. But here it
must be observed that in most parts of mathematical computation
a very small error is not material. In different species
of calculations, more or less exactness may be required; but
even in the most delicate operations, there is always a limit
beyond which accuracy is useless, because it cannot be appreciated.
For example, in measuring land for sale, an error
decimal fractions. 45
of an inch in five hundred yards is not worth avoiding, since
even if such an error were committed, it would not make a
difference which would be considered as of any consequence,
as in all probability the expense of a more accurate measurement
would be more than the small quantity of land thereby
saved would be worth. But in the measurement of a line for
the commencement of a trigonometrical survey, an error of
an inch in five hundred yards would be fatal, because the subsequent
processes involve calculations of such a nature that
this error would be multiplied, and cause a considerable error
in the final result. Still, even in this case, it would be useless
to endeavor to avoid an error of one-thousandth part of
an inch in five hundred yards; first, because no instruments
hitherto made would show such an error: and secondly, because
if they could, no material difference would be made in
the result by a correction of it. Again, we know that almost
all bodies are lengthened in all directions by heat. For example:
A brass ruler which is a foot in length to-day, while
it is cold, will be more than a foot to-morrow if it is warm.
The difference, nevertheless, is scarcely, if at all, perceptible
to the naked eye, and it would be absurd for a carpenter, in
measuring a few feet of mahogany for a table, to attempt to
take notice of it; but in the measurement of the base of a
survey, which is several miles in length and takes many days
to perform, it is necessary to take this variation into account,
as a want of attention to it may produce perceptible errors in
the result: nevertheless, any error which has not this effect,
it would be useless to avoid even were it possible. We see,
on the study of mathematics. 46
therefore, that we may, instead of a fraction, which cannot
be reduced to a decimal, substitute a decimal fraction, if we
can find one so near to the former, that the error committed
by the substitution will not materially affect the result. We
will now proceed to show how to find a series of decimal fractions,
which approach nearer and nearer to a given fraction,
and also that, in this approximation, we may approach as
near as we please to the given fraction without ever being
exactly able to reach it.
Take, for example,, the fraction 7
11 . If we divide the series
of numbers 70, 700, 7000, etc., by 11, we shall obtain the
following results:
70
11 gives the quotient 6, and the remainder 4, and is 6 4
11 ,
700
11 “ 63 “ 7 63 7
11 ,
7000
11 “ 636 “ 4 636 4
11 ,
70000
11 “ 6363 “ 7 6363 7
11 ,
etc., etc., etc.
Now observe that if two numbers do not differ by so much
as 1, their tenth parts do not differ by so much as 1
10 , their
hundredth parts by so much as 1
100 , their thousandth parts
by so much as 1
1000 , and so on; and also remember that 7
11 is
the tenth part of 70
11 , the hundredth part of 700
11 , and so on.
decimal fractions. 47
The two following tables will now be apparent:
70
11 does not differ from 6 by so much as 1,
700
11 “ 63 “ 1,
7000
11 “ 636 “ 1,
70000
11 “ 6363 “ 1,
etc., etc., etc.
Therefore
7
11 does not differ from 6
10 or .6, by so much as 1
10 or .1,
7
11 “
63
100 “ .63 “ 1
100 “ .01,
7
11 “
636
1000 “ .636 “ 1
1000 “ .001,
7
11 “
6363
10000 “ .6363 “ 1
10000 “ .0001,
etc., etc., etc.
We have then a series of decimal fractions, viz., .6, .63, .636,
.6363, .63636, etc., which continually approach more and
more near to 7
11 , and therefore in any calculation in which
the fraction 7
11 appears, any one of these may be substituted
for it, which is sufficiently near to suit the purpose for which
the calculation is intended. For some purposes .636 would
be a sufficient approximation; for others .63636363 would
be necessary. Nothing but practice can show how far the
approximation should be carried in each case.
The division of one decimal fraction by another is
performed as follows: Suppose it required to divide 6.42
on the study of mathematics. 48
by 1.213. The first of these is 642
100 , and the second 1233
1000 . The
quotient of these by the ordinary rule is 642000
121300 , or 6420
1213 . This
fraction must now be reduced to a decimal on the principles
of the last article, by the rule usually given, either exactly,
or by approximation, according to the nature of the factors
in the denominator.
When the decimal fraction corresponding to a common
fraction cannot be exactly found, it always happens that
the series of decimals which approximates to it, contains the
same number repeated again and again. Thus, in the example
which we chose, 7
11 is more and more nearly represented
by the fractions .6, .63, .636, .6363, etc., and if we carried
the process on without end, we should find a decimal fraction
consisting entirely of repetitions of the figures 63 after
the decimal point. Thus, in finding 1
7
, the figures which are
repeated in the numerator are 142857. This is what is commonly
called a circulating decimal, and rules are given in
books of arithmetic for reducing them to common fractions.
We would recommend to the beginner to omit all notice of
these fractions, as they are of no practical use, and cannot be
thoroughly understood without some knowledge of algebra.
It is sufficient for the student to know that he can always
either reduce a common fraction to a decimal, or find a decimal
near enough to it for his purpose, though the calculation
in which he is engaged requires a degree of accuracy which
the finest microscope will not appreciate. But in using approximate
decimals there is one remark of importance, the
necessity for which occurs continually.
decimal fractions. 49
Suppose that the fraction 2.143876 has been obtained,
and that it is more than sufficiently accurate for the calculation
in which it is to be employed. Suppose that for the
object proposed it is enough that each quantity employed
should be a decimal fraction of three places only, the quantity
2.143876 is made up of 2.143, as far as three places of
decimals are concerned, which at first sight might appear to
be what we ought to use, instead of 2.143876. But this is not
the number which will in this case give the utmost accuracy
which three places of decimals will admit of; the common
usages of life will guide us in this case. Suppose a regiment
consists of 876 men, we should express this in what we call
round numbers, which in this case would be done by saying
how many hundred men there are, leaving out of consideration
the number 76, which is not so great as 100; but in doing
this we shall be nearer the truth if we say that the regiment
consists of 900 men instead of 800, because 900 is nearer
to 876 than 800. In the same manner, it will be nearer the
truth to write 2.144 instead of 2.143, if we wish to express
2.143876 as nearly as possible by three places of decimals,
since it will be found by subtraction that the first of these is
nearer to the third than the second. Had the fraction been
2.14326, it would have been best expressed in three places
by 2.143; had it been 2.1435, it would have been equally
well expressed either by 2.143 or 2.144, both being equally
near the truth; but 2.14351 is a little more nearly expressed
by 2.144 than by 2.143.
We have now gone through the leading principles of arith-
on the study of mathematics. 50
metical calculation, considered as a part of general Mathematics.
With respect to the commercial rules, usually considered
as the grand object of an arithmetical education, it
is not within the scope of this treatise to enter upon their
consideration. The mathematical student, if he is sufficiently
well versed in their routine for the purposes of common life,
may postpone their consideration until he shall have become
familiar with algebraical operations, when he will find no difficulty
in understanding the principles or practice of any of
them. He should, before commencing the study of algebra,
carefully review what he has learnt in arithmetic, particularly
the reasonings which he has met with, and the use of
the signs which have been introduced. Algebra is at first
only arithmetic under another name, and with more general
symbols, nor will any reasoning be presented to the student
which he has not already met with in establishing the rules of
arithmetic. His progress in the former science depends most
materially, if not altogether, upon the manner in which he
has attended to the latter; on which account the detail into
which we have entered on some things which to an intelligent
person are almost self-evident, must not be deemed
superfluous.
When the student is well acquainted with the principles
and practice of arithmetic, and not before, he should commence
the study of algebra. It is usual to begin algebra and
geometry together, and if the student has sufficient time, it
is the best plan which he can adopt. Indeed, we see no reason
why the elements of geometry should not precede those
decimal fractions. 51
of algebra, and be studied together with arithmetic. In this
case the student should read some treatise which relates to
geometry, first. It is hardly necessary to say that though
we have adopted one particular order, yet the student may
reverse or alter that order so as to suit the arrangement of
his own studies.
We now proceed to the first principles of algebra, and the
elucidation of the difficulties which are found from experience
to be most perplexing to the beginner. We suppose him to
be well acquainted with what has been previously laid down
in this treatise, particularly with the meaning of the signs
+, -, ×, and the sign of division.
CHAPTER VI.
ALGEBRAICAL NOTATION AND PRINCIPLES.
Whenever any idea is constantly recurring, the best thing
which can be done for the perfection of language, and consequent
advancement of knowledge, is to shorten as much as
possible the sign which is used to stand for that idea. All
that we have accomplished hitherto has been owing to the
short and expressive language which we have used to represent
numbers, and the operations which are performed upon
them. The first step was to write simple signs for the first
numbers, instead of words at full length, such as 8 and 7, instead
of eight and seven. The next was to give these signs an
additional meaning, according to the manner in which they
were connected with one another; thus 187 was made to represent
one hundred added to eight tens added to seven. The
next was to give by new signs directions when to perform
the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division; thus 5 + 8 was made to represent 8 added to 5, and
so on. With these signs reasonings were made, and truths
discovered which are common to all numbers; not at once
for every number, but by taking some example, by reasoning
upon it, and by producing a result; this result led to
a rule which was declared to be a rule which held equally
good for all numbers, because the reasoning which produced
it might have been applied to any other example as well as
to the one which was chosen. In this way we produced some
algebraical notation and principles. 53
results, and might have produced many more; the following
is an instance: half the sum of two numbers added to half
their difference, gives the greater of the two numbers. For
example, take 16 and 10, half their sum is 13, half their difference
is 3; if we add 13 and 3 we get 16, the greater of the
two numbers. We might satisfy ourselves of the truth of this
same proposition for any other numbers, such as 27 and 8,
15 and 19, and so on. If we then make use of signs, we find
the following truths:
16 + 10
2
+
16 - 10
2
= 16,
27 + 8
2
+
27 - 8
2
= 27,
15 + 9
2
+
15 - 9
2
= 15,
and so on. If, then, we choose any two numbers, and call
them the first and second numbers, and call that the first
number which is the greater of the two, we have the following:
First No. + Second No.
2
+
First No. - Second No.
2
= First No.
In this way we might express anything which is true of all
numbers, by writing First No., Second No., etc., for the
different numbers which enter into our proposition, and we
might afterwards suppose the First No., the Second No., etc.,
to be any which we please. In this way we might write down
the following assertion, which we should find to be always
on the study of mathematics. 54
true:
(First No. + Second No.) × (First No. - Second No.)
= First No. × First No. - Second No. × Second No.
When any sentence expresses that two numbers or collections
of numbers are equal to one another, it is called an
equation*
thus 7 + 5 = 12 is an equation, and the sentences
written just above are equations.
Now the next question is, could we not avoid the trouble
of writing First No., Second No., etc., so frequently? This
is done by putting letters of the alphabet to stand for these
numbers. Suppose, e. g., we let x stand for the first number,
and y for the second, the two assertions already made will
then be written:
x + y
2
+
x - y
2
= x,
(x + y) × (x - y) = x × x - y × y.
By the use of letters we are thus enabled to write sentences
which say something of all numbers, with a very small
part only of the time and trouble necessary for writing the
same thing at full length. We now proceed to enumerate the
various symbols which are used.
1. The letters of the alphabet are used to stand for numbers,
and whenever a letter is used it means either that any
*As now usually defined an equation always contains an unknown
quantity. See also p. 90.—Ed.
algebraical notation and principles. 55
number may be used instead of that letter, or that the number
which the letter stands for is not known, and that the
letter supplies its place in all the reasonings until it is known.
2. The sign + is used for addition, as in arithmetic. Thus
x+z is the sum of the numbers represented by x and z. The
following equations are sufficiently evident:
x + y + z = x + z + y = y + z + x.
If a = b, then a + c = b + c, a + c + d = b + c + d, etc.
3. The sign - is used for subtraction, as in arithmetic.
The following equations will show its use:
x + a - b - c + e = x + a + e - b - c
= a - c + e - b + x.
If a = b, then a - c = b - c, a - c + d = b - c + d, etc.
4. The sign × is used for multiplication as in arithmetic,
but when two numbers represented by letters are multiplied
together it is useless, since a×b can be represented by putting
a and b together thus, ab. Also a×b×c is represented by abc;
a × a × a, for the present we represent thus, aaa. When two
numbers are multiplied together, it is necessary to keep the
sign ×; otherwise 7×5 or 35 would be mistaken for 75. It is,
however, usual to place a point between two numbers which
are to be multiplied together; thus 7×5×3 is written 7·5·3.
But this point may sometimes be mistaken for the decimal
point: this will, however, be avoided by always writing the
on the study of mathematics. 56
decimal point at the head of the figure, viz., by writing 23461
100
thus, 234.
61.
5. Division is written as in arithmetic: thus, a
b
signifies
that the number represented by a is to be divided by the
number represented by b.
6. All collections of numbers are called expressions; thus,
a + b, a + b - c, aa + bb - d, are algebraical expressions.
7. When two expressions are to be multiplied together, it
is indicated by placing them side by side, and inclosing each
of them in brackets. Thus, if a + b + c is to be multiplied
by d + e + f, the product is written in any of the following
ways:
(a + b + c)(d + e + f),
[a + b + c][d + e + f],
{a + b + c}{d + e + f},
a + b + c · d + e + f.
8. That a is greater than b is written thus, a > b.
9. That a is less than b is written thus, a < b.
10. When there is a product in which all the factors
are the same, such as xxxxx, which means that five equal
numbers, each of which is represented by x, are multiplied
together, the letter is only written once, and above it is written
the number of times which it occurs, thus xxxxx is written
x
5
. The following table should be carefully studied by
algebraical notation and principles. 57
the student:
x × x or xx is written x
2
,
and is called the square, or second power of x,
x × x × x or xxx is written x
3
,
and is called the cube, or third power of x,
x × x × x × x or xxxx is written x
4
,
and is called the fourth power of x,
x × x × x × x × x or xxxxx is written x
5
,
and is called the fifth power of x,
etc., etc., etc.
There is no point which is so likely to create confusion
in the ideas of a beginner as the likeness between such expressions
as 4x and x
4
. On this account it would be better
for him to omit using the latter expression, and to put xxxx
in its place until he has acquired some little facility in the
operations of algebra. If he does not pursue this course, he
must recollect that the 4, in these two expressions, has different
names and meanings. In 4x it is called a coefficient,
in x
4 an exponent or index.
The difference of meaning will be apparent from the fol-
on the study of mathematics. 58
lowing tables:
2x = x + x x2 = x × x = xx,
3x = x + x + x x3 = x × x × x or xxx,
4x = x + x + x + x x4 = x × x × x × x or xxxx,
etc., etc.
If x = 3, 2x = 6, x2 = 9,
3x = 9, x3 = 27,
4x = 12, x4 = 81.
The beginner should frequently write for himself such
expressions as the following:
4a
3
b
2 = aaabb + aaabb + aaabb + aaabb,
5a
4x = aaaax + aaaax + aaaax + aaaax + aaaax,
9a
2
b
3 + 4ab4 = 9aabbb + 4abbbb,
a
2 + b
2
a

aa - bb =

aa - bb,
a
3 - b
3
a
2 - b
2
=
aaa - bbb
aa - bb =
aa + ab + bb
a + b
.
With many such expressions every book on algebra will furnish
him, and he should then satisfy himself of their truth
by putting some numbers at pleasure instead of the letters,
and making the results agree with one another. Thus, to try
algebraical notation and principles. 59
the expression
a
3 - b
3
a - b
= a
2 + ab + b
2
,
or, which is the same,
aaa - bbb
a - b
= a
2 + ab + b
2
.
Let a stand for 6 and b stand for 4, then, if this expression
be true,
6 · 6 · 6 - 4 · 4 · 4
6 - 4
= 6 · 6 + 6 · 4 + 4 · 4,
which is correct, since each of these expressions is found, by
calculation, to be 76.
The student should then exercise himself in the solution
of such questions as the following: What is
a
2 + b
2 -
ab
a + b
+
a
a + b
- a,
I. when a stands for 6, and b for 5, II. when a stands for 13,
and b for 2, and so on. He should stop here until he has,
by these means, made the signs familiar to his eye and their
meaning to his mind; nor should he proceed to any further
algebraical operations until he can readily find the value of
any algebraical expression when he knows the numbers which
the letters stand for. He cannot, at this period of his course,
on the study of mathematics. 60
write too many algebraical expressions, and he must particularly
avoid slurring over the sense of what he has before
him, and must write and rewrite each expression until the
meaning of the several parts forces itself upon his memory at
first sight, without even the necessity of putting it in words.
It is the neglecting to do this which renders the operations
of algebra so tedious to the beginner. He usually proceeds
to the addition, subtraction, etc., of symbols, of the meaning
of which he has but an imperfect idea, and which have
been newly introduced to him in such numbers that perpetual
confusion is the consequence. We cannot, therefore, use
too many arguments to induce him not to mind the drudgery
of reducing algebraical expressions into figures. This is the
connecting link between the new science and arithmetic, and,
unless that link be well fastened, the knowledge which he has
previously acquired in arithmetic will help him but little in
acquiring algebra.
The order of the terms of any algebraical expression may
be changed without changing the value of that expression.
This needs no proof, and the following are examples of the
change:
a + b + ab + c + ac - d - e - de - f
= a - d + b - e + ab - de + c - f + ac
= a + b - d - e - de - f + ac + c + ab
= ab + ac - de + a + b + c - e - f - d.
When the first term changes its place, as in the fourth of
algebraical notation and principles. 61
these expressions, the sign + is put before it, and should,
properly speaking, be written wherever there is no sign, to
indicate that the term in question increases the result of
the rest, but it is usually omitted. The negative sign is often
written before the first term, as in the expression -a+b: but
it must be recollected that this is written on the supposition
that a is subtracted from what comes after it.
When an expression is written in brackets, with some
sign before it, such as a - (b - c), it is understood that the
expression in brackets is to be considered as one quantity,
and that its result or total is to be connected with the rest
by the sign which precedes the brackets. In this example it
is the difference of b and c which is to be subtracted from a.
If a = 12, b = 6, and c = 4, this is 10. In the expression a-b
made by subtracting b from a, too much has been subtracted
by the quantity c, since it is not b, but b - c, which must be
subtracted from a. In order, therefore, to make a - (b - c),
c must be added to a - b, which gives a - b + c. Therefore,
a - (b - c) = a - b + c. Similarly
a + b - (c + d - e - f) = a + b - c - d + e + f,
(ax2 - bx + c) - (dx2 - ex + f)
= ax2 - bx + c - dx2 + ex - f.
When the positive sign is written before an expression in
brackets, the brackets may be omitted altogether, unless they
serve to show that the expression in question is multiplied
by some other. Thus, instead of (a + b + c) + (d + e + f), we
on the study of mathematics. 62
may write a + b + c + d + e + f, which is, in fact, only saying
that two wholes may be added together by adding together
all the parts of which they are composed. But the expression
a+(b+c)(d+e) must not be written thus: a+b+c(d+e), since
the first expresses that (b + c) must be multiplied by (d + e)
and the product added to a, and the second that c must be
multiplied by (d + e) and the product added to a+ b. If a, b,
c, d, and e, stand for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the first is 46 and the
second 30.
When two or more quantities have exactly the same
letters repeated the same number of times, such as 4a
2
b
3
,
and 6a
2
b
3
, they may be reduced into one by merely adding
the coefficients and retaining the same letters. Thus, 2a+3a
is 5a, 6bc - 4bc is 2bc, 3(x + y) + 2(x + y) is 5(x + y).
These things are evident, but beginners are very liable to
carry this farther than they ought, and to attempt to reduce
expressions which do not admit of reduction. For example,
they will say that 3b+2
is 4b or 4b
2
, neither of which is true,
except when b stands for 1. The expression 3b+b
2
, or 3b+bb,
cannot be made more simple until we know what b stands
for. The following table will, perhaps, be of service:
6a
2
b
3 + 3a
3
b
2
is not 9a
5
b
5
,
6a
3 - 4a
2
is not 2a,
2ba + 3b is not 5ab.
Such are the mistakes which beginners almost universally
make, mostly for want of a moment’s consideration. They
algebraical notation and principles. 63
attempt to reduce quantities which cannot be reduced, which
they do by adding the exponents of letters as well as their
coefficients, or by collecting several terms into one, and leaving
out the signs of addition and subtraction. The beginner
cannot too often repeat to himself that two terms can never
be made into one, unless both have the same letters, each
letter being repeated the same number of times in both, that
is, having the same index in both. When this is the case, the
expressions may be reduced by adding or subtracting the
coefficients according to the sign, and affixing the common
letters with their indices. When there is no coefficient, as
in the expression a
2
b, the quantity represented by a
2
b being
only taken once, 1 is called the coefficient. Thus,
3ab + 4ab + 6ab - ab - 7ab = 5ab,
6xy2 + 3xy2 - 5xy2 + xy2 = 5xy2
.
The student must also recollect that he is not at liberty to
change an index from one letter to another, as by so doing
he changes the quantity represented. Thus a
4
b and ab4 are
quantities totally distinct, the first representing aaaab and
the second abbbb. The difference in all the cases which we
have mentioned will be made more clear, by placing numbers
at pleasure instead of letters in the expressions, and calculating
their values; but, in conclusion, the following remark
must be attended to. If it were asserted that the expression
a
2 + b
2
a + b
is the same as a+b-
2ab
2a - b
, and we wish to proceed
to see whether this is always the case or no, if we commence
on the study of mathematics. 64
accidentally by supposing b to stand for 2 and a for 4, we
shall find that the first is the same as the second, each being
3 1
2
. But we must not conclude from this that they are
always the same, at least until we have tried whether they
are so, when other numbers are substituted for a and b. If we
place 6 and 8 instead of a and b, we shall find that the two
expressions are not equal, and therefore we must conclude
that they are not always the same. Thus in the expressions
3x - 4 and 2x + 8, if x stand for 12, these are the same, but
if it stands for any other number they are not the same.
CHAPTER VII.
ELEMENTARY RULES OF ALGEBRA.
The student should be very well acquainted with the principles
and notation hitherto laid down before he proceeds to
the algebraical rules for addition and subtraction. He should
then take some simple examples of each, and proceed to find
the sum and difference by reasoning as follows. Suppose it
is required to add c - d to a - b. The direction to do this
may either be written in the common way thus:
a - b
c - d
Add
or more properly thus: Find (a - b) + (c - d).
If we add c to a, or find a + c, we have too much; first,
because it is not a which is to be increased by c - d but
a - b; this quantity must therefore be decreased by b on this
account, or must become a + c - b; but this is still too great,
because it is not c which was to be added but c - d; it must
therefore be decreased by d on this account, or must become
a + c - b - d or a - b + c - d. From a few reasonings of this
sort the rule may be deduced; and not till then should an
example be chosen so complicated as to make the student
lose sight for one moment of his demonstration. The process
of subtraction we have already performed, and from a few
examples of this method the rule may be deduced.
on the study of mathematics. 66
The multiplication of a by c - d is performed thus: a is
to be taken c - d times. Take it first c times or find ac. This
is too great, because a has been taken too many times by d.
From ac we must therefore subtract d times a, or ad, and
the result is that
a(c - d) = ac - ad.
This may be verified from arithmetic, in which the same
process is shown to be correct; and this whether the numbers
a, c, and d are whole or fractional. For example, it will be
found that 6(14 - 9) or 6 × 5 is the same as 6 × 14 - 6 × 9,
or as 84 - 54. Also that 2
3
(
1
7 -
2
15 ), or 2
3 ×
1
105 is the same
as 2
3 ×
1
7 -
2
3 ×
2
15 , or as 2
21 -
4
45 . Upon similar reasoning the
following equations may be proved:
a(b + c - d) = ab + ac - ad,
(p + pq - ar)xz = pxz + pqxz - arxz,
(a
2 + 2b
2
)b
2
, or (aa + 2bb)bb = aabb + 2bbbb = a
2
b
2 + 2b
4
.
Also when a multiplication has been performed, the process
may be reversed and the factors of it may be given. Thus,
on observing the expression
ab - ac + a
2
,
or ab - ac + aa,
we see that in its formation every term has been multiplied
elementary rules of algebra. 67
by a; that is, it has been made by multiplying
b - c + a by a,
or a by b - c + a.
There will now be no difficulty in perceiving that
ac + ad + bc + bd = a(c + d) + b(c + d)
= (a + b)(c + d),
a
2 - ab2 + 2abc - dc + 3a = a(a - b
2 + 3) + c(2ba - d).
It is proved in arithmetic that if numbers, whether whole or
fractional, are multiplied together, the product remains the
same when the order in which they are multiplied is changed.
Thus 6×4×3 = 3×6×4 = 4×6×3, etc., and 2
3 ×
4
5 =
4
5 ×
2
3
,
etc. Also, that a part of the multiplication may be made, and
the partial product substituted instead of the factors which
produced it, thus, 3×4×5×6 is 12×5×6, or 15×4×6, or
90 × 4. From these rules two complicated single terms may
be multiplied together, and the product represented in the
most simple manner which the case admits of. Thus if it be
required to multiply
6a
3
b
4
c, which is 6 aaa bbbb c
by 12a
2
b
3
c
3
d, which is 12 aa bbb ccc d,
the product is written thus:
6 aaa bbbb c 12 aa bbb ccc d,
on the study of mathematics. 68
which multiplication may be performed in the following order
6 × 12 aaaaa bbbbbbb cccc d,
which is represented by 72a
5
b
7
c
4d. A few examples of this
sort will establish the rule for the multiplication of such
quantities which is usually given in the treatises on Algebra.
It is to be recollected that in every algebraical formula
which is true of all numbers, any algebraical expression may
be substituted for one of the letters, provided care is taken
to make the substitution wherever that letter occurs. Thus
from the formula:
a
2 - b
2 = (a + b)(a - b)
we may deduce the following by making substitutions for a.
If this formula be always true, it is true when a is equal
to p+q, that is, it is true if p+q be put instead of a wherever
that letter occurs in the formula. Therefore,
(p + q)
2 - b
2 = (p + q + b)(p + q - b).
Similarly,
(b + m)
2 - b
2 = (2b + m)m,
(x + y)
2 - (x - y)
2 = (x + y + x - y)(x + y - x - y) = 4xy,
and so on.
elementary rules of algebra. 69
We have already established the formula,
(p - q)a = ap - aq.
Instead of a let us put r - s, and this formula becomes
(p - q)(r - s) = (r - s)p - (r - s)q.
But
(r - s)p = pr - ps, and (r - s)q = qr - qs.
Therefore
(p - q)(r - s) = pr - ps - (qr - qs)
= pr - ps - qr + qs.
By reasoning in the same way we may prove that
(p - q)(r + s) = pr + ps - qr - qs.
A few examples of this sort will establish what is called
the rule of signs in multiplication; viz., that a term of the
multiplicand multiplied by a term of the multiplier has the
sign + before it if the terms have the same sign, and - if they
have different signs. But here the student must avoid using
an incorrect mode of expression, which is very common, viz.,
the saying that + multiplied by + gives +; - multiplied by +
gives -; and so on. He must recollect that the signs + and -
are not quantities, but directions to add and subtract, and
on the study of mathematics. 70
that, as has been well said by one of the most luminous
writers on algebra in our language, we might as well say,
that take away multiplied by take away gives add, as that
- multiplied by - gives +.*
The only way in which the student should accustom himself
to state this rule is the following: “In multiplying two algebraical
expressions, multiply each term of the one by each
term of the other, and wherever two terms are preceded by
the same sign put + before the product of the two; when the
signs are different put the sign - before their product.”
If the student should meet with an equation in which
positive and negative signs stand by themselves, such as
+ab × -c = -abc,
let him, for the present, reject the example in which it occurs,
and defer the consideration of such equations until he
has read the explanation of them to which we shall soon
come. Above all, he must reject the definition still sometimes
given of the quantity -a, that it is less than nothing.
It is astonishing that the human intellect should ever have
tolerated such an absurdity as the idea of a quantity less than
nothing;† above all, that the notion should have outlived the
*Frend, Principles of Algebra. The author of this treatise is far
from agreeing with the work which he has quoted in the rejection of the
isolated negative sign which prevails throughout it, but fully concurs
in what is there said of the methods then in use for explaining the
difficulties of the negative sign.
†For a full critical and historical discussion of this point, see
elementary rules of algebra. 71
belief in judicial astrology and the existence of witches, either
of which is ten thousand times more possible.
These remarks do not apply to such an expression as
-b+a, which we sometimes write instead of a-b, as long as
it is recollected that the one is merely used to stand for the
other, and for the present a must be considered as greater
than b.
In writing algebraical expressions, we have seen that various
arrangements may be adopted. Thus ax2 - bx + c may
be written as c + ax2 - bx, or -bx + c + ax2
. Of these three
the first is generally chosen, because the highest power of x
is written first; the highest but one comes next; and last of
all the term which contains no power of x. When written in
this way the expression is said to be arranged in descending
powers of x; had it been written thus, c - bx + ax2
, it would
have been arranged in ascending powers of x; in either case
it is said to be arranged in powers of x, which is called the
principal letter. It is usual to arrange all expressions which
occur in the same question in powers of the same letter,
and practice must dictate the most convenient arrangement.
Time and trouble is saved by this operation, as will be evident
from multiplying two unarranged expressions together,
and afterwards doing the same with the same expressions
properly arranged.
In multiplying two arranged expressions together, while

on the study of mathematics. 72
collecting such terms into one as will admit of it, it will always
be evident that the first and last of all the products
contain powers of the principal letter which are found in no
other part, and stand in the product unaltered by combination
with any other terms, while in the intermediate products
there are often two or more which contain the same power of
the principal letter, and can be reduced into one. This will
be evident in the following examples:
Multiply x
6 - 3x
5 + x
4
By x
4 - 2x
2 + x
The product is x
10 - 3x
9 + x

8 + 6x
7 - 2x
6

7 - 3x
6 + x

Or x
10 - 3x
9 - x
8 + 7x
7 - 5x
6 + x

.
Multiply ax3 + bx2 + cx
By dx2 + ex + f
The product is adx5 + bdx4 + cdx3

Or adx5 + (bd + ae)x

+ (cd + be + af)x
3
+ (ce + bf)x
2
+ cfx.
It is plain from the rule of multiplication, that the highest
power of x in a product must be formed by multiplying
elementary rules of algebra. 73
the highest power in one factor by the highest power in the
other, or when the two factors have been arranged in descending
powers, the first power in one by the first power in
the other. Also, that the lowest power of x, or should it so
happen, the term in which there is no power of x, is made by
multiplying the last terms in each factor. These being the
highest and lowest, there can be no other such power, consequently
neither of these terms can coalesce with any other,
as is the case in the intermediate products. This remark will
be of most convenient application in division, to which we
now come.
Division is in all respects the reverse of multiplication.
In dividing a by b we find the answer to this question: If
a be divided into b equal parts, what is the magnitude of
each of those parts? The quotient is, from the definition of
a fraction, the same as the fraction a
b
, and all that remains
is to see whether that fraction can be represented by a simple
algebraical expression without fractions or not; just as
in arithmetic the division of 200 by 26 is the reduction of
the fraction 200
26 to a whole number, if possible. But we must
here observe that a distinction must be drawn between algebraical
and arithmetical fractions. For example, a + b
a - b
is an
algebraical fraction, that is, there is no expression without
fractions which is always equal to a + b
a - b
. But it does not
follow from this that the number which a + b
a - b
represents is
on the study of mathematics. 74
always an arithmetical fraction; the contrary may be shown.
Let a stand for 12, and b for 6, then a + b
a - b
is 3. Again,
a
2 +ab is a quantity which does not contain algebraical fractions,
but it by no means follows that it may not represent
an arithmetical fraction. To show that it may, let a =
1
2
and
b = 2, then a
2 + ab = 1 1
4
or 5
4
. Other examples will clear up
this point if any doubt yet exist in the mind of the student.
Nevertheless, the following propositions of arithmetic and algebra,
which only differ in this, that “whole number” in the
arithmetical proposition is replaced by “simple expression”
*
in the algebraical one, connect the two subjects and render
those demonstrations which are in arithmetic confined
to whole numbers, equally true in algebra as far as regards
simple expressions:
The sum, difference, or
product of two whole numbers,
is a whole number.
The sum, difference, or
product of two simple expressions
is a simple expression.
One number is said to be
a measure of another when
the quotient of the two is a
whole number.
One expression is said
to be a measure of another
when the quotient of the two
is a simple expression.
*By a simple expression is meant one which does not contain the
principal letter in the denominator of any fraction.
elementary rules of algebra. 75
The greatest common
measure of two whole numbers
is the greatest whole
number which measures both,
and is the product of all the
prime numbers which will
measure both.
The greatest common
measure of two expressions is
the common measure which
has the highest exponents
and coefficients, and is the
product of all prime simple
expressions which measure
both.
When one number measures
two others, it measures
their sum, difference, and
product.
When one expression
measures two others, it measures
their sum, difference,
and product.
In the division of one
number by another, the
remainder is measured by
any number which measures
the dividend and divisor.
In the division of one
expression by another, the
remainder is measured by any
expression which measures
the dividend and divisor.
A fraction is not altered
by multiplying or dividing
both its numerator and
denominator by the same
quantity.
A fractional expression is
not altered by multiplying or
dividing both its numerator
and denominator by the same
expression.
In the term simple expression are included those quantities
which contain arithmetical fractions, provided there is
no algebraical quantity, or quantity represented by letters in
the denominator; thus 1
4
ab +
1
2
is called a simple expression.
We now proceed to the division of one simple expression by
another, and we will take first the case where neither quantity
contains more than one term. For example, what is
on the study of mathematics. 76
42a
4
b

c divided by 6a
2
bc? that is, what quantity must be
multiplied by 6a
2
bc, in order to produce 42a
4
b
3
c. This last
expression written at length, is 42 aaaa bbb c, and 42 is 6×7.
We can then separate this expression into the product of
two others, one of which shall be 6a
2
bc, or 6aabc; it will
then be 6aabc × 7aabb, and it is 7aabb which must be multiplied
by 6aabc in order to produce 42a
4
b
3
c. A few examples
worked in this way, will lead the student to the rule usually
given in all cases but one, to which we now come. We have
represented cc, ccc, cccc, etc., by c
2
, c
3
, c
4
, etc., and have
called them the second, third, fourth, etc., powers of c. The
extension of this rule would lead us to represent c by c
1
, and
call it the first power of c. Again, we have represented c + c,
c+c+c, c+c+c+c, etc. by 2c, 3c, 4c, and have called 2, 3,
4, etc., the coefficients of c. The extension of this rule would
lead us to write c thus, 1c, or, rather, if we attend to the last
remark, 1c
1
. This instance leads us to observe the gradual
progress of our language. We begin with the quantity c by
itself; we proceed in our course, shortening by new signs the
more complicated combinations of c, and the original quantity
c forces itself anew upon our attention as a part of the
series,
c, 2c, 3c, 4c, etc., and c, c
2
, c
3
, c
4
, etc.,
in each of which, except the first, there is a distinct figure,
which is called a coefficient or exponent, according to its situation.
We then deduce rules in which the terms coefficient
or exponent occur, but which, of course, cannot apply to
elementary rules of algebra. 77
the first term in each series, because, as yet, it has neither
coefficient nor exponent. Among such rules are the following:
I. To add two terms of the first series, add the coefficients,
and affix to the sum the letter c. Thus 4c + 3c = 7c.
II. To multiply two terms of the second series, add the
exponents, and make this sum the exponent of c. Thus
c
4 × c
3 = c
7
.
III. To divide a term of the second series by one which
comes before it, subtract the exponent of the divisor from
the exponent of the dividend, and make this difference the
exponent of c. Thus,
c
7
c
4
= c
3
.
These rules are intelligible for all terms of the series except
the first, to which, nevertheless, they will apply if we
agree that 1c
1
shall represent c, as will be evident by applying
either of them to find 4c+c, c
4×c, or
c
4
c
. We therefore agree
that 1c
1
shall stand for c, and although c is not written thus,
it must be remembered that c is to be considered as having
the coefficient 1 and the exponent 1, which is an amendment
and enlargement of our algebraical language, derived from
experience. It may be said that this is all superfluous, because,
if c
2
stand for cc, and c
3
for ccc, what can c
1
stand for
but c? But it must be recollected that, since the symbol c
1
has not yet received a meaning, we are at liberty to make it
stand for anything which we please, for example, for 1 + c
c
,
on the study of mathematics. 78
or c-c
2
, or any other. If we did this, there would, indeed, be
a great violation of analogy, that is, what c
1
stands for would
not be as like that which c
2 has been made to stand for, as
the meaning of c
3
is to that of c
4
; but, nevertheless, we should
not be led to any incorrect results as long as we remembered
to make c
1 always stand for the same thing. These remarks
are here introduced in order to show the manner in which
analogy is followed in extending the language of algebra, and
to prove that, after a certain period, we may rather be said
to discover new symbols than to make them. The immense
importance of this branch of the subject makes it necessary
that it should be fully and early understood by all who intend
to pursue their mathematical studies to any depth. To
illustrate it still further, we subjoin another instance, which
has not been noticed in its proper place.
The signs + and - were first used to connect one quantity
with others, and to show what arithmetical operations were
performed on other quantities by means of the first. But
the first quantity on which we begin the operation is not
preceded by any sign, not being considered as added to or
subtracted from any previous one. Rules were afterwards
deduced for the addition and subtraction of the total result
of several expressions in which these signs occur, as follows:
To add two expressions, form a third, which has all the
quantities in the first two, with the same signs.
To subtract one expression from another, change the sign
of each term of the subtrahend, and proceed as in the last
rule.
elementary rules of algebra. 79
The only terms in which these rules do not apply are
those which have no sign, viz., the first of each. But they
will apply to those terms, and will produce correct results, if
we place the sign + before each of them. We are thus led to
see that an algebraical term which has no sign is equivalent
in all operations to one which is preceded by the sign +.
We, therefore, consider this sign as prefixed, though it is not
always written, and thus we are furnished with a method of
containing under one rule that which would otherwise require
two.
From these considerations the following appears to be
the best and most natural course of proceeding in the invention
of additional symbols. When a rule has been discovered
which is not quite general, and which only fails in its application
to a few instances, annex such additional symbols to
those already in use, or change and modify these so as to
make the rule applicable in all cases, provided always this
can be done without making the same symbol stand for two
different things, and without any violation of analogy. If the
rule itself, by its application to any case, should produce a
new symbol hitherto unexplained, it is a sign that the rule
has been applied to a case which was never intended to fall
under it when it was made. For the solution of this case we
must have recourse to first principles, but when, by these
means, the result has been found, it will be best to agree
that the new symbol furnished by the rule shall stand for
the result furnished by the principle, by which means the
generality of the rule will be attained and the analogy of
on the study of mathematics. 80
language will not be injured. Of this the following is a remarkable
instance:
To divide c
8 by c
5
the rule tells us to subtract 5 from 8,
and make the result the exponent of c, which gives the quotient
c
3
. If we apply the same rule to divide c
6 by c
6
, since
6 subtracted from 6 leaves 0, the result is c
0
, a new symbol,
to which we have attached no meaning. The fact is that the
rule was formed from observation of different powers of c,
and was never intended to apply to the division of a power
of c by the same power. If we apply the common principles to
the division of c
6 by c
6
, the result is 1. We, therefore, agree
that c
0
shall stand for 1, and the least inspection will show
that this agreement does not affect the truth of any result
derived from the rule. If, in the solution of any problem, the
symbol c
0
should appear, we must consider it is a sign that
we have, in the course of the investigation, divided a power
of c by itself by the common rule, without remarking that
the quotient is 1. We must, therefore, replace c
0 by 1, but
it is entirely indifferent at what stage of the process this is
done.
Several extensions might be noticed, which are made
almost intuitively, to which these observations will apply.
Such, for example, is the multiplication and division of any
number by 1, which is not contemplated in the definition
of these operations. Such is also the continual use of 0 as a
quantity, the addition and subtraction of it from other quantities,
and the multiplication of it by others, neither of which
were contemplated when these operations were first thought
elementary rules of algebra. 81
of.
We now proceed to the principles on which more complicated
divisions are performed. The question proposed in
division, and the manner of answering it, may be explained
in the following manner. Let A be an expression which is to
be divided by H, and let Q be the quotient of the two. By
the meaning of division, if there be no remainder A = QH,
since the quotient is the expression which must multiply the
divisor, in order to produce the dividend. Now let the quotient
be made up of different terms, a, b, c, etc., let it be
a + b - c + d. That is, let
A = QH, (1)
Q = a + b - c + d. (2)
By putting, instead of Q in (1), that which is equal to it
in (2), we find
A = (a + b - c + d)H = aH + bH - cH + dH. (3)
Now suppose that we can by any method find the term a
of the quotient, that is, that we can by trial or otherwise
find one term of the quotient. In (3), when the term a is
found, since H is known, the term aH is found. Now if two
quantities are equal, and from them we subtract the same
quantity, the remainders will be equal. Subtract aH from
the equal quantities A and aH + bH - cH + dH, and we
shall find
A - aH = bH - cH + dH = (b - c + d)H. (4)
on the study of mathematics. 82
If, then, we multiply the term of the quotient found by the
divisor, and subtract the product from the dividend, and call
the remainder B; then
B = (b - c + d)H. (5)
That is, if B be made a dividend, and H still continue the
divisor, the quotient is b - c + d, or all the first quotient,
except the part of it which we have found. We then proceed
in the same manner with this new dividend, that is, we find
b and also bH, and subtract it from B, and let B - bH be
represented by C, which gives by the process which has just
been explained
C = (-c + d)H = -cH + dH. (6)
We now come to a negative term of the quotient. Let
us suppose that we have found c, and that its sign in the
quotient is -. If two quantities are equal, and we add the
same quantity to both, the sums are equal. Let us therefore
add cH to both the equal quantities in (6), and the equation
will become
C + cH = dH; (7)
or if we denote C + cH by D, this is
D = dH.
There is only one term of the quotient remaining, and if that
can be found the process is finished. But as we cannot know
elementary rules of algebra. 83
when we have come to the last term, we must continue the
same process, that is, subtract dH from D, in doing which
we shall find that dH is equal to D, or that the remainder is
nothing. This indicates that the quotient is now exhausted
and that the process is finished.
We will now apply this to an example in which the quotient
is of the same form as that in the last process, namely,
consisting of four terms, the third of which has the negative
sign. This is the division of
x
4 - y
4 - 3x
2
y
2 + x
3
y + 2xy3
by x - y.
Arrange the first quantity in descending powers of x which
will make it stand thus:
x
4 + x
3
y - 3x
2
y
2 + 2xy3 - y
4
. (A)
One term of the quotient can be found immediately, for since
it has been shown that the term containing the highest power
of x in a product is made up of nothing but the product of
the terms containing the highest powers of x which occur
in the multiplier and multiplicand, and considering that the
expression (A) is the product of x - y and the quotient,
we shall recover the highest power of x in the quotient by
dividing x
4
, the highest power of x in (A), by x, its highest
power in x - y. This division gives x
3 as the first term of
the quotient. The following is the common process, and with
each line is put the corresponding step of the process above
on the study of mathematics. 84
explained, of which this is an example:

The whole quotient is therefore x
3 + 2x
2
y - xy2 + y
3
.
The second and following terms of the quotient are determined
in exactly the same manner as the first. In fact,
this process is not the finding of a quotient directly from
the divisor and dividend, but one term is first found, and by
means of that term another dividend is obtained, which only
differs from the first in having one term less in the quotient,
viz., that which was first found. From this second dividend
one term of its quotient is found, and so on until we obtain
a dividend whose quotient has only one term, the finding of
which finishes the process. It is usual also to neglect all the
terms of the first dividend, except those which are immediately
wanted, taking down the others one by one as they
elementary rules of algebra. 85
become necessary. This is a very good method in practice
but should be avoided in explaining the principle, since the
first subtraction is made from the whole dividend, though
the operation may only affect the form of some part of it.
If the student will now read attentively what has been
said on the greatest common measure of two numbers, and
then examine the connexion of whole numbers in arithmetic
and simple expressions in algebra with which we commenced
the subject of division, he will see that the greatest algebraical
common measure of two expressions may be found in
exactly the same manner as the same operation is performed
in arithmetic. He must also recollect that the greatest common
measure of two expressions A and B is not altered by
multiplying or dividing either of them, A, for example, by
any quantity, provided that quantity has no measure in common
with B. For example, the greatest common measure of
a
2 - x
2 and ba3 - bx3
is the same with that of 2a
2 - 2x
2
and a
3 - x
3
, since though a new measure is now introduced
into the first and taken away from the second, nothing is
introduced or taken away which is common to both. The
same observation applies to arithmetic also. For example,
take the numbers 162 and 180. We may, without altering
their greatest common measure, multiply the first by 7 and
the second by 11, etc. The rule for finding the greatest common
measure should be practised with great attention by all
who intend to proceed beyond the usual stage in algebra. To
others it is not of the same importance, as the necessity for
it never occurs in the lower branches of the science.
on the study of mathematics. 86
In proceeding to the subject of fractions, it must be observed
that, in the same manner as in arithmetic, when there
is a remainder which cannot be further divided by the divisor,
that is, where the dividend is so reduced that no simple
term multiplied by the first term of the divisor will give the
first term of the remainder, as in the case where the divisor
is a
2x + bx2 and the remainder ax + b; in this case a fraction
must be added to the quotient, whose numerator is this
remainder, and whose denominator is the divisor. Thus, in
dividing a
4 + b
4 by a + b, the quotient is a
3 - a
2
b + ab2 - b
3
,
and the remainder 2b
4
, whence
a
4 + b
4
a + b
= a
3 - a
2
b + ab2 - b
3 +
2b
4
a + b
.
The arithmetical rules for the addition, etc., of fractions hold
equally good when the numerators and denominators are
themselves fractions. Thus
3
4
2
7
and
1
5
3
2
are added, etc., exactly
in the same way as 2
5
and 3
7
, the sum of the second being
7 × 2 + 5 × 3
5 × 7
and that of the first
3
2 ×
3
4 +
2
7 ×
1
5
2
7 ×
3
2
.
The rules for the addition, etc., of algebraic fractions are exactly
the same as in arithmetic; for both the numerator and
elementary rules of algebra. 87
denominator of every algebraic fraction stands either for a
whole number or a fraction, and therefore the fraction itself
is either of the same form as 6
7
or
2
3
4
5
. Nevertheless the student
should attend to some examples of each operation upon
algebraic fractions, by way of practice in the previous operations.
As the subject is not one which presents any peculiar
difficulties, we shall now pass on to the subject of equations,
concluding this article with a list of formulas which it is
highly desirable that the student should commit to memory
before proceeding to any other part of the subject.

CHAPTER VIII.
EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE.
We have already defined an equation, and have come to
many equations of different sorts. But all of them had this
character, that they did not depend upon the particular
number which any letter stood for, but were equally true,
whatever numbers might be put in place of the letters. For
example, in the equation
a
2 - 1
a + 1
= a - 1
the truth of the assertion made in this algebraical sentence is
the same, whether a be considered as representing 1, 2, 2 1
2
,
etc., or any other number or fraction whatever. The second
side of this equation is, in fact, the result of the operation
pointed out on the first side. On the first side you are directed
to divide a
2 - 1 by a + 1; the second side shows you
the result of that division. An equation of this description
is called an identical equation, because, in fact, its two sides
are but different ways of writing down the same number.
This will be more clearly seen in the identical equations
a + a = 2a, 7a - 3a + b = 4a - 3b + 4b, and a
b
× b = a.
The whole of the formulæ at the end of the last article
are examples of identical equations. There is not one of them
which is not true for all values which can be given to the
on the study of mathematics. 90
letters which enter into them, provided only that whatever
a letter stands for in one part of an equation, it stands for
the same in all the other parts.
If we take, now, such an equation as a+1 = 8, we have an
equation which is no longer true for every value which can be
given to its algebraic quantities. It is evident that the only
number which a can represent consistently with this equation
is 7, as any other supposition involves absurdity. This
is a new species of equation, which can only exist in some
particular case, which particular case can be found from the
equation itself. The solution of every problem leads to such
an equation, as will be shown hereafter, and, in the elements
of algebra, this latter species of equation is of most importance.
In order to distinguish them from identical equations,
they are called equations of condition, because they cannot
be true when the letters contained in them stand for any
number whatever, and their very existence makes a condition
which the letters contained must fulfil. The solution
of an equation of condition is the process of finding what
number the letter must stand for in order that the equation
may be true. Every such solution is a process of reasoning,
which, setting out with supposing the truth of the equation,
proceeds by self-evident steps, making use of the common
rules of arithmetic and algebra. We shall return to the subject
of the solution of equations of condition, after showing,
in a few instances, how we come to them in the solution
of problems. In equations of condition, the quantity whose
value is determined by the equation is usually represented by
equations of the first degree. 91
one of the last letters of the alphabet, and all others by some
of the first. This distinction is necessary only for the beginner;
in time he must learn to drop it, and consider any letter
as standing for a quantity known or unknown, according to
the conditions of the problem.
In reducing problems to algebraical equations no general
rule can be given. The problem is some property of a number
expressed in words by which that number is to be found, and
this property must be written down as an equation in the
most convenient way. As examples of this, the reduction of
the following problems into equations is given:
I. What number is that to which, if 56 be added, the
result will be 200 diminished by twice that number?
Let x stand for the number which is to be found.
Then x + 56 = 200 - 2x.
If, instead of 56, 200, and 2, any other given numbers,
a, b, and c, are made use of in the same manner, the equation
which determines x is
x + a = b - cx.
II. Two couriers set out from the same place, the second
of whom goes three miles an hour, and the first two. The
first has been gone four hours, when the second is sent after
him. How long will it be before he overtakes him?
Let x be the number of hours which the second must
travel to overtake the first. At the time when this event
takes place, the first has been gone x + 4 hours, and will
on the study of mathematics. 92
have travelled (x+4)2, or 2x+8 miles. The second has been
gone x hours, and will have travelled 3x miles. And, when
the second overtakes the first, they have travelled exactly the
same distance, and, therefore,
3x = 2x + 8.
If, instead of these numbers, the first goes a miles an
hour, the second b, and c hours elapse before the second is
sent after the first,
bx = ax + ac.
Four men, A, B, C, and D, built a ship which cost £2607,
of which B paid twice as much as A, C paid as much as
A and B, and D as much as C and B. What did each pay?
Suppose that A paid x pounds,
then B paid 2x. . . ,
C paid x + 2x or 3x. . . ,
D paid 2x + 3x or 5x. . . .
All together paid x + 2x + 3x + 5x, or 11x, therefore
11x = 2607.
There are two cocks, from the first of which a cistern is
filled in 12 hours, and the second in 15. How long would
they be in filling it if both were opened together?
equations of the first degree. 93
Let x be the number of hours which would elapse before
it was filled. Then, since the first cock fills the cistern in
12 hours, in one hour it fills 1
12 of it, in two hours 2
12 , etc.,
and in x hours x
12 . Similarly, in x hours, the second cock
fills x
15 of the cistern. When the two have exactly filled the
cistern, the sum of these fractions must represent a whole
or 1, and, therefore,
x
12
+
x
15
= 1.
If the times in which the two can fill the cistern are a and
b hours, the equation becomes
x
a
+
y
b
= 1.
A person bought 8 yards of cloth for £3 2s., giving 9s. a
yard for some of it and 7s. a yard for the rest; how much of
each sort did he buy?
Let x be the number of yards at 7s. Then 7x is the
number of shillings they cost. Also 8 - x is the number of
yards at 9s., and (8-x)9, or 72-9x, is the number of shillings
they cost. And the sum of these, or 7x+72-9x, is the whole
price, which is £3 2s., or 62 shillings, and, therefore,
7x + 72 - 9x = 62.
These examples will be sufficient to show the method of
reducing a problem to an equation. Assuming a letter to
stand for the unknown quantity, by means of this letter the
on the study of mathematics. 94
same quantity must be found in two different forms, and
these must be connected by the sign of equality. However,
the reduction into equations of such problems as are usually
given in the treatises on algebra rarely occurs in the applications
of mathematics. The process is a useful exercise of
ingenuity, but no student need give a great deal of time to it.
Above all, let no one suppose, because he finds himself unable
to reduce to equations the conundrums with which such
books are usually filled, that, therefore, he is not made for
the study of mathematics, and should give it up. His future
progress depends in no degree upon the facility with which he
discovers the equations of problems; we mean as far as power
of comprehending the subsequent sciences is concerned. He
may never, perhaps, make any considerable step for himself,
but, without doing this, he may derive all the benefits which
the study of mathematics can afford, and even apply them
extensively. There is nothing which discourages beginners
more than the difficulty of reducing problems to equations,
and yet, as respects its utility, if there be anything in the
elements which may be dispensed with, it is this. We do not
wish to depreciate its utility as an exercise for the mind, or to
hinder all from attempting to conquer the difficulties which
present themselves; but to remind every one that, if he can
read and understand all that is set before him, the essential
benefit derived from mathematical studies will be gained,
even though he should never make one step for himself in
the solution of any problem.
We return now to the solution of equations of condition.
equations of the first degree. 95
Of these there are various classes. Equations of the first
degree, commonly called simple equations, are those which
contain only the first power of the unknown quantity. Of this
class are all the equations to which we have hitherto come
in the solution of problems. The principle by which they
are solved is, that two equal quantities may be increased or
diminished, multiplied, or divided by any quantity, and the
results will be the same. In algebraical language, if a = b,
a + c = b + c, a - c = b - c, ac = bc, and a
c
=
b
c
. In
every elementary book it is stated that any quantity may be
removed from one side of the equation to the other, provided
its sign be changed. This is nothing but an application of the
principle just stated, as may be shown thus: Let a+b-c = d,
add c to both quantities, then
a + b - c + c = d + c or a + b = d + c.
Again subtract b from both quantities, then a + b - c - b =
d-b, or a-c = d-b. Without always repeating the principle,
it is derived from observation, that its effect is to remove
quantities from one side of an equation to another, changing
their sign at the same time. But the beginner should not
use this rule until he is perfectly familiar with the manner
of using the principle. He should, until he has mastered a
good many examples, continue the operation at full length,
instead of using the rule, which is an abridgment of it. In
fact it would be better, and not more prolix, to abandon the
received phraseology, and in the example just cited, instead
on the study of mathematics. 96
of saying “bring the term b to the other side of the equation,”
to say “subtract b from both sides,” and instead of saying
“bring c to the other side of the equation,” to say “add c to
both sides.”
Suppose we have the fractions 3
4
,
1
7
, and 5
14 . If we multiply
them all by the product of the denominators 4 × 7 × 14,
or 392, all the products will be whole numbers. They will
be 3 × 392
4
,
1 × 392
7
, and 5 × 392
14
, and since 392 is measured
by 4, 3 × 392 is also measured by 4, and 3 × 392
4
is
a whole number, and so on. But any common multiple of
4, 7, and 14 will serve as well. The least common multiple
will therefore be the most convenient to use for this purpose.
The least common multiple of 4, 7, and 14 is 28, and if the
three fractions be multiplied by 28, the results will be whole
numbers. The same also applies to algebraic fractions. Thus
a
b
,
c
de, and e
bdf , will become simple expressions, if they are
multiplied by b × de × bdf, or b
2d
2
ef. But the most simple
common multiple of b, de, and dbf, is bdef, which should be
used in preference to b
2d
2
ef.
This being premised, we can now reduce any equation
which contains fractions to one which does not. For example,
take the equation
x
3
+
2x
5
=
7
10
-
3 - 2x
6
.
If we multiply both these equal quantities by any other,
equations of the first degree. 97
the results will be equal. We choose, then, the least quantity,
which will convert all the fractions into simple quantities,
that is, the least common multiple of the denominators
3, 5, 10, and 6, which is 30. If we multiply both equal quantities
by 30, the equation becomes
30x
3
+
60x
5
=
210
10
-
30(3 - 2x)
6
. (1)
But 30x
3
is
30
3
× x or 10x,
60x
5
is
60
5
× x, or 12x, etc.; so
that we have
10x + 12x = 21 - 5(3 - 2x), (2)
or 10x + 12x = 21 - (15 - 10x), (3)
or 10x + 12x = 21 - 15 + 10x. (4)
Beginners very commonly mistake this process, and forget
that the sign of subtraction, when it is written before a fraction,
implies that the whole result of the fraction is to be
subtracted from the rest. As long as the denominator remains,
there is no need to signify this by putting the numerator
between brackets, but when the denominator is taken
away, unless this be done, the sign of subtraction belongs to
the first term of the numerator only, and not to the whole
expression. The way to avoid this mistake would be to place
in brackets the numerators of all fractions which have the
negative sign before them, and not to remove those brackets
until the operation of subtraction has been performed, as is
done in equation (4).

The following operations will afford exercise to the student,
sufficient, perhaps, to enable him to avoid this error:
a +
b - c + d - e
f
=
af + b - c + d - e
f
,
a -
b - c + d - e
f

2
a + b
,
a + b -
(a - b)
2
a + b
=
4ab
a + b
.
We can now proceed with the solution of the equation.
Taking up the equation (4) which we have deduced from it,
subtract 10x from both sides, which gives 10x+ 12x-10x =
21 - 15, or 12x = 6: divide these equal quantities by 12,
which gives 12x
12
=
6
12
, or x =
1
2
. This is the only value
which x can have so as to make the given equation true, or,
as it is called, to satisfy the equation. If instead of x we
substitute 1

equations of the first degree. 99
In these equations of the first degree there is one unknown
quantity and all the others are known. These known quantities
may be represented by letters, and, as we have said,
the first letters of the alphabet are commonly used for that
purpose. We will now take an equation of exactly the same
form as the last, putting letters in place of numbers:
x
a
+
bx
c
=
d
c
-
f - gx
h
.
The solution of this equation is as follows: multiply both
quantities by aceh, the most simple multiple of the denominators,
it then becomes:
acehx
a
+
abcehx
c
=
acdeh
e
-
aceh(f - gx)
h
,
or, cehx + abcehx = acdh - ace(f - gx),
or, cehx + abcehx = acdh - acef + acegx.
Subtract acegx from both sides, and it becomes
cehx + abehx - acegx = acdh - acef,
or, (ceh + abeh - aceg)x = acdh - acef.
Divide both sides by ceh + abeh - aceg, which gives
x =
acdh - acef
ceh + abeh - aceg
.
The steps of the process in the second case are exactly
the same as in the first; the same reasoning establishes them
on the study of mathematics. 100
both, and the same errors, are to be avoided in each. If from
this we wish to find the solution of the equation first given,
we must substitute 3 for a, 2 for b, 5 for c, 7 for d, 10 for e,
3 for f, 2 for g, and 6 for h, which gives for the value of x,
3 × 5 × 7 × 6 - 3 × 5 × 10 × 3
5 × 10 × 6 + 3 × 2 × 10 × 6 - 3 × 5 × 10 × 2
,
or,
3 × 5 × 12
3 × 2 × 10 × 6
, or,
180
360
,
which is 1
2
, the same as before.
If in one equation there are two unknown quantities, the
condition is not sufficient to fix the values of the two quantities;
it connects them, nevertheless, so that if one can be
found the other can be found also. For example, the equation
x + y = 8 admits of an infinite number of solutions, for
take x to represent any whole number or fraction less than 8,
and let y represent what x wants of 8, and this equation is
satisfied. If we have another equation of condition existing
between the same quantities, for example, 3x - 2y = 4; this
second equation by itself has an infinite number of solutions:
to find them, y may be taken at pleasure, and x =
4 + 2y
3
.
Of all the solutions of the second equation, one only is a solution
of the first; thus there is only one value of x and y which
satisfies both the equations, and the finding of these values is
the solution of the equations. But there are some particular
cases in which every value of x and y which satisfies one of
the equations satisfies the other also; this happens whenever
equations of the first degree. 101
one of the equations can be deduced from the other. For
example, when x + y = 8, and 4x - 29 = 3 - 4y, the second
of these is the same as 4x + 4y = 3 + 29, or 4x + 4y = 32,
which necessarily follows from the first equation.
If the solution of a problem should lead to two equations
of this sort, it is a sign that the problem admits of an infinite
number of solutions, or is what is called an indeterminate
problem. The solution of equations of the first degree does
not contain any peculiar difficulty; we shall therefore proceed
to the consideration of the isolated negative sign.
CHAPTER IX.
ON THE NEGATIVE SIGN, ETC.
If we wish to say that 8 is greater than 5 by the number 3,
we write this equation 8 - 5 = 3. Also to say that a exceeds
b by c, we use the equation a - b = c. As long as some
numbers whose value we know are subtracted from others
equally known, there is no fear of our attempting to subtract
the greater from the less; of our writing 3 - 8, for
example, instead of 8 - 3. But in prosecuting investigations
in which letters occur, we are liable, sometimes from inattention,
sometimes from ignorance as to which is the greater of
two quantities, or from misconception of some of the conditions
of a problem, to reverse the quantities in a subtraction,
for example to write a-b where b is the greater of two quantities,
instead of b-a. Had we done this with the sum of two
quantities, it would have made no difference, because a + b
and b + a are the same, but this is not the case with a - b
and b - a. For example, 8 - 3 is easily understood; 3 can be
taken from 8 and the remainder is 5; but 3-8 is an impossibility,
it requires you to take from 3 more than there is in 3,
which is absurd. If such an expression as 3 - 8 should be
the answer to a problem, it would denote either that there
was some absurdity inherent in the problem itself, or in the
manner of putting it into an equation. Nevertheless, as such
answers will occur, the student must be aware what sort of
mistakes give rise to them, and in what manner they affect
on the negative sign, etc. 103
the process of investigation.
We would recommend to the beginner to make experience
his only guide in forming his notions of these quantities,
that is, to draw his rules from the observation of many
results, not from any theory. The difficulties which encompass
the theory of the negative sign are explained at best in
a manner which would embarrass him: probably he would
not see the difficulties themselves; too easy belief has always
been the fault of young students in mathematics, and it is
a great point gained to get them to start an objection. We
shall observe the effect of this error in denoting a subtraction
on every species of investigation to which we have hitherto
come, and shall deduce rules which the student will recollect
are the results of experience, not of abstract reasoning. The
extensions to which he will be led have rendered Algebra
much more general than it was before, have made it competent
to the solution of many, very many questions which
it could not have touched had they not been attended to.
They do, in fact, constitute part of the groundwork of modern
Algebra and should be considered by the student who
is desirous of making his way into the depths of the science
with the highest degree of attention. If he is well practised
in the ordinary rules which have hitherto been explained,
few difficulties can afterwards embarrass him, except those
which arise from some confusion in the notions which he has
formed upon this part of the subject.
For brevity’s sake we hereafter use this phrase. Where
the signs of every term in an expression are changed, it is
on the study of mathematics. 104
said to have changed its form. Thus +a - b and +b - a are
in different forms, and if a be greater than b, the first is the
correct form and the second incorrect. An extension of a
rule is made by which such a quantity as 3 - 8 is written
in a different way. Suppose that +3 - 8 is connected with
any other number thus, 56 + 3 - 8. This may be written
56 + 3 - (3 + 5), or 56 + 3 - 3 - 5, or 56 - 5. It appears,
then, that +3 - 8, connected with any number is the same
as -5 connected with that number; from this we say that
+3 - 8, or 3 - 8 is the same thing as -5, or 3 - 8 = -5.
This is another way of writing the equation 8 - 3 = 5, and
indicates equally that 8 is greater than 5 by 3. In the same
way, a - b = -c indicates that b is greater than a by the
quantity c. If a be nothing, this equation becomes -b = -c,
which indicates that b = c, since if the equation a - b = -c
be written in its true form b-a = c, and if a = 0, then b = c.
We can now understand the following equations:
a - b + c - d = -e, or b + d - a - c = e,
2ab - a
2 - b
2 = -d - e, or a
2 + b
2 - 2ab = d + e.
We must not commence any operations upon such an
equation as a - b = -c, until we have satisfied ourselves of
the manner in which they should be performed, by reference
to the correct form of the equation. This correct form is
b-a = c. This gives d + b-a = d + c, or d-(a-b) = d + c.
Write instead of a-b its symbol -c, and then d-(-c) = d+c.
Here we have performed an operation with a - b, which is
on the negative sign, etc. 105
no quantity, since a is less than b, but this is done because
our present object is, in applying the common rules to such
expressions, to watch the results and exhibit them in their
real forms. The first side d - (-c) is in a form in which
we can attach no meaning to it, and the second side gives
its real form d + c. The meaning of this expression is, that
if with a - b, which we think to be a quantity, but which
is not, since a is less than b, we follow the algebraical rule
in subtracting a - b from d, we shall thereby get the same
result as if we had added the real quantity b - a to d. If we
make use of the form d - (-c), it is because we can use it
in such a manner as never to lose sight of its connexion with
its real form d + c, and because we can establish rules which
will lead us to the end of a process without any error, except
those which we can correct as certainly at the end as at the
beginning.
The rule by which we proceed, and which we shall establish
by numerous examples, is, that wherever two like signs
come together, the corresponding part of the real form has a
positive sign, and wherever two unlike signs come together,
the real form has a negative sign. Thus the real form of
d - (-c) is d + c. Again, take the real form b - a = c of the
equation a - b = -c, and it follows that d - (b - a) = d - c,
or d-b+a = d-c, or d+a-b = d-c, or d+ (a-b) = d-c.
This is d + (-c) = d - c, another case in which the rule
is verified. Again, multiply together a - b and m - n, the
product is am - an - bm + bn. This is the same product as
arises from multiplying b-a by n- m, written in a different
on the study of mathematics. 106
order. If, then, b - a = c, and n - m = p, or a - b = -c,
and m - n = -p, we find that (-c) × (-p) = cp. By which
result we mean that a mistake, in the form of both a-b and
m - n, will not produce a mistake in the form of their product,
which remains what it would have been had the mistake
not been made. Again
(n - m)(b - a) = bn - bm - an + am,
(n - m)(a - b) = an - am - bn + bm.
If the first product be real and equal to P, the second is
represented by -P. The first is cp, the second is (-c) × p,
which gives
(-c) × p = -cp.
That is, a mistake in the form of one factor only alters the
form of the product. To distinguish the right form from the
wrong one, we may prefix + to the first, and - to the second,
and we may then recapitulate the results, and add others,
which the student will now be able to verify.
The sign + placed before single quantities shows that the
form of the quantity is correct; the sign - shows that it has
been mistaken or changed.
a + (+b) = a + b, a + (-b) = a - b,
a - (+b) = a - b, a - (-b) = a + b,
(+a) × (+b) = +ab, (+a) × (-b) = -ab,
(-a) × (-b) = +ab = (+a) × (+b),

,
etc., etc.
We see, then, that a change in the form of any quantity
changes the form of those powers whose exponent is an odd
number, but not of those whose exponent is an even number.
By these rules we shall be able to tell what changes would
be made in an expression by altering the forms of any of its
letters. It may be fairly asked whether we are not changing
the meaning of the signs + and -, in making +a stand for
an expression in which we do not alter the signs, and -a for
one in which the signs are altered. The change is only in
name, for since the rule of addition is, “annex the expressions
which are to be added without altering the signs of
either,” or “annex the expressions without altering the form
of either;” the quantity a + b, which is the sum of the two
expressions a and b, stands for the same as +a + b, in which
the new notion of the sign + is used, viz., the expressions
a and b are annexed with unaltered forms, which is denoted
by writing together +a and +b. Again, the rule for sub-
on the study of mathematics. 108
traction is, “change the sign of the subtrahend or expression
which is to be subtracted, and annex the result to the other
expression,” or “change the form of the subtrahend and annex
it to the other,” which, the expressions being a and b,
is written a - b, which answers equally well to the second
notion of the sign -, since +a - b indicates that a and b are
to be annexed, the first without, the second with a change
of form. These ideas of the signs + and - give, therefore, in
practice, the same results as the former ones, and, in future,
the two meanings may be used indiscriminately. But when
a single term is used, such as +a or -a, the last acquired
notions of + and - are always understood.
This much being premised, we can see, by numberless
instances, that, if the form of a quantity is to be changed, it
matters nothing whether it is changed at the beginning of the
process, or whether we wait till the end, and then follow the
rules above mentioned. This is evident to the more advanced
student, from the nature of the rules themselves, but the
beginner should satisfy himself of this fact from experience.
We now give a proof of this, as far as one expression can
prove it, in the solution of the equations,
a
2
b
+ ax =
a
2x
b
+ a - b,
and a
2
b
- ax =
a
2x
b
- a - b,
which two equations only differ in the form in which a appears.
For, if the form of a in the first equation be altered,
on the negative sign, etc. 109
that of a
2
b
and a
2x
b
is unaltered, +ax becomes -ax, and
+a becomes -a. We now solve the two equations in opposite
columns.
a
2
b
+ ax =
a
2x
b
+ a - b,
a
2 + abx = a
2x + ab - b
2
,
a
2 - ab + b
2 = a
2x - abx
= (a
2 - ab)x,
x =
a
2 - ab + b
2
a
2 - ab ;
a
2
b
- ax =
a
2x
b
- a - b,
a
2 - abx = a
2x - ab - b
2
,
a
2 + ab + b
2 = a
2x + abx
= (a
2 + ab)x,
x =
a
2 + ab + b
2
a
2 + ab .
The only difference between these expressions arises from
the different form of a in the two. If, in either of them,
-a be put instead of +a, and the rules laid down be followed,
the other will be produced. We see, then, that a simple
alteration of the form of a in the original equation produces
no other change in the result, or in any one of the steps
which lead to that result, except a simple alteration in the
form of a. From this it follows that, having the solution of
an equation, we have also the solution of all the equations
which can be formed from it, by altering the form of the
different known quantities which are contained in it. And,
as all problems can be reduced to equations, the solution
of one problem will lead us to the solution of others, which
differ from the first in producing equations in which some of
the known quantities are in different forms. Also, in every
identical equation, the form of one or more of its quantities
on the study of mathematics. 110
may be altered throughout, and the equation will still remain
identically true. For example,
a
3 - b
3
a - b
= a
2 + ab + b
2
.
Change +b into -b, and this equation will become
a
3 + b
3
a + b
= a
2 - ab + b
2
,
which last, common division will show to be true.
Again, suppose than when a, b, and c are in a given
form, which we denote by +a, +b, and +c, the solution of a
problem is,
x =
b
2 - 4ac
a + c - b
.
The following table will show the alterations which take
place in x when the forms of a, b, and c are changed in
different manners, and the verification of it will be an exercise
for the student.

on the negative sign, etc. 111
Also, the expression for x may be written in the following
different ways, the forms of a, b, and c remaining the same:
b
2 - 4ac
a + c - b
, -
b
2 - 4ac
b - a - c
, -

,

.
We now proceed to apply these principles to the solution
of the following problems:
Two couriers, A and B, in the course of a journey between
the towns C and D, are at the same moment of time
at A and B. A goes m miles, and B, n miles an hour. At
what point between C and D are they together? It is evident
that the answer depends upon whether they are going
in the same or opposite directions, whether A goes faster
or slower than B, and so on. But all these, as we shall
see, are included in the same general problem, the difference
between them corresponding to the different forms of the letters
which we shall have occasion to use. After solving the
different cases which present themselves, each upon its own
principle, we shall compare the results in order to establish
their connexion. Let the distance AB be called a.
Case first.—Suppose that they are going in the same direction
from C to D, and that m is greater than n. They will
then meet at some point between B and D. Let that point
be H, and let AH be called x. Then A travels through AH,
on the study of mathematics. 112
or x, in the time during which B travels through BH, or
x - a. But, since A goes m miles an hour, he travels the
distance x in
x
m
hours. Again, B travels the distance x - a
in
x - a
n
hours. These times are the same, and, therefore,
x
m
=
x - a
n
, or x =
ma
m - n
= AH
and x - a =
na
m - n
= BH.
The time which elapses before they meet is
x
m
or
a
m - n
.
Case second.—Suppose them now moving in the same
direction as before, but let B move faster than A. They never
will meet after they come to A and B, since B is continually
gaining upon A, but they must have met at some point before
reaching A and B. Let that point be H, and, as before, let
AH = x. Then since A travels through HA or x in the time
during which B travels through HB, or x + a, in the same
on the negative sign, etc. 113
manner as in the last case, we show that
x
m
=
x + a
n
, or x =
ma
n - m
= AH
and x + a =
na
n - m
= BH.
The time elapsed is a
n - m
.
Case third.—If they are moving from D to C, and if
B moves faster than A, the point H is the same as in the last
case, since, if having in the last case arrived at A and B, they
move back again at the same rate, they will both arrive at
the point H together. The answers in this case are therefore
the same as in the last.
Case fourth.—Similarly, if they are moving from D to C,
and A moves faster than B, the answers are the same as in
the first case, since this is a reverse of the first case, as the
third is of the second. We reserve for the present the case in
which they move equally fast, as another species of difficulty
is involved which has no connexion with the present subject.
We shall return to it hereafter.
Case fifth.—Suppose them now moving in contrary directions,
viz.: A towards D and B towards C. Whether
A moves faster or slower than B, they must now meet somewhere
between A and B; as before let them meet in H, and
let AH = x. Then A moves through AH, or x, in the same
on the study of mathematics. 114
time as B moves through BH, or a - x. Therefore
x
m
=
a - x
n
, or
x =
ma
m + n
,
a - x =
na
m + n
.
The time elapsed is a
m + n
.
Case sixth.—Let them be moving in contrary directions,
but let A be moving towards C, and B towards D. They will
then have met somewhere between A and B, and as this is
only the reverse of the last case, just as the fourth is of the
first, or the third of the second, the answers are the same.
We now exhibit the results of these different cases in a table,
stating the circumstances of each case, and also whether the
time of meeting is before or after the instant which finds
them at A and B.
Now a
m - n
and a
n - m
are the same quantity written in
different forms, for n - m is -(m - n); and according to the
rules
a
n - m
= -
a
m - n
.
Similarly

= -

and so on.
We see also, that in the first and second cases, which differ
in this, that AH falls to the right in the first, and to the left in
the second, the forms of AH are different, there being ma
m - n
in the first, and -
ma
m - n
in the second. Again, in the same
cases, in the first of which the time of meeting is after, and
in the second before the moment of being at A and B, we see
a difference of form in the value of that time; in the first it
is
a
m - n
, and in the second -
a
m - n
, or
a
n - m
. The same
remarks apply to the third and fourth examples. Again, in
the first and fifth cases, which only differ in this, that B is
moving towards D in the first, and in the contrary direction
on the study of mathematics. 116
towards C in the fifth, the values of AH, and of the time,
may be deduced from the first by changing the form of n, and
writing +n, instead of -n. The expression for BH in the
first, if the form of n be likewise changed, becomes -
na
m + n
,
which is the value of BH in the fifth, but in a different form.
But we observe that BH falls to the left of B in the fifth,
whereas it fell to the right in the first. Again, in the first and
sixth examples, which differ in this that A moves towards D
in the first and towards C in the sixth, the value of AH in
the sixth may be deduced from that of AH in the first by
changing the form of m, which change makes AH become
-ma
-m - n
, or
-ma
-(m + n)
, or
ma
m + n
. If we alter the value of the
time in the first, in the same manner, it becomes a
-m - n
,
or -
a
m + n
, which is of a different form from that in the
sixth; but it must also be observed that the first is after and
the other before the moment when they are at A and B. In
the fifth and sixth examples which differ in this, that the
direction in which both are going is changed, since in the
fifth they move towards one another, and in the sixth away
from one another, the values of AH and BH in the one may
be deduced from those in the other by a change of form, both
in m and n, which gives the same values as before. But if
m and n change their forms in the expression for the time,
the value in the sixth case is a
-m - n
, or -
a
m + n
. Also the
time in the fifth case is after the moment at which they are
on the negative sign, etc. 117

(Table of Page 115 Repeated.)
at A and B, and in the sixth case it is before. From these
comparisons we deduce the following general conclusions:
1. If we take the first case as a standard, we may, from
the values which it gives, deduce those which hold good in all
the other cases. If a second case be taken, and it is required
to deduce answers to the second case from those of the first,
this is done by changing the sign of all those quantities whose
directions are opposite in the second case to what they are
in the first, and if any answer should appear in a negative
form, such as ma
m - n
, when m is less than n, which may be
written thus -
ma
n - m
, it is a sign that the quantity which
on the study of mathematics. 118
it represents is different in direction in the first and second
cases. If it be a right line measured from a given point in all
the cases, such as AH, it is a sign that AH falls on the left
in the second case, if it fell on the right in the first case, and
the converse. If it be the time elapsed between the moment
in which the couriers are at A and B and their meeting, it is
a sign that the moment of meeting is before the other, in the
second case, if it were after it in the first, and the converse.
We see, then, that these six cases can be all contained in
one if we apply this rule, and it is indifferent which of the
cases is taken as the standard, provided the corresponding
alterations are made to determine answers to the rest.
This detail has been entered into in order that the student
may establish from his own experience the general principle
which will conclude this part of the subject. Further illustration
is contained in the following problem:
A workman receives a shillings a day for his labor or a
proportion of a shillings for any part of a day which he works.
His expenses are b shillings every day, whether he works or
no, and after m days he finds that he has gained c shillings.
How many days did he work? Let x be that number of
days, x being either whole or fractional; then for his work he
receives ax shillings, and during the m days his expenditure
is bm shillings, and since his gain is the difference between
on the negative sign, etc. 119
his receipts and expenditure:
ax - bm = c,
or x =
bm + c
a
.
Now suppose that he had worked so little as to lose c shillings
instead of gaining anything. The equation from which x is
derived is now
bm - ax = c,
which, when its form is changed, becomes
ax - bm = -c,
an equation which only differs from the former in having
-c written instead of c. The solution of the equation is
x =
bm - c
a
,
which only differs from the former in having -c instead of +c.
It appears then that we may alter the solution of a problem
which proceeds upon the supposition of a gain into the
solution of one which supposes an equal loss, by changing
the form of the expression which represents that gain; and
also that if the answer to a problem which we have solved
upon the supposition of a gain should happen to be negative,
suppose it -c, we should have proceeded upon the supposition
that there is a loss and should in that case have found
on the study of mathematics. 120
a loss, c. When such principles as these have been established,
we have no occasion to correct an erroneous solution
by recommencing the whole process, but we may, by means
of the form of the answer, set the matter right at the end.
The principle is, that a negative solution indicates that the
nature of the answer is the very reverse of that which it was
supposed to be in the solution; for example, if the solution
supposes a line measured in feet in one direction, a negative
answer, such as -c, indicates that c feet must be measured
in the opposite direction; if the answer was thought to be a
number of days after a certain epoch, the solution shows that
it is c days before that epoch; if we supposed that A was to
receive a certain number of pounds, it denotes that he is to
pay c pounds, and so on, In deducing this principle we have
not made any supposition as to what -c is; we have not asserted
that it indicates the subtraction of c from 0; we have
derived the result from observation only, which taught us
first to deduce rules for making that alteration in the result
which arises from altering +c into -c at the commencement;
and secondly, how to make the solution of one case of a problem
serve to determine those of all the others. By observation
then the student must acquire his conviction of the truth of
these rules, reserving all metaphysical discussion upon such
quantities as +c and -c to a later stage, when he will be
better prepared to understand the difficulties of the subject.
We now proceed to another class of difficulties, which are
generally, if possible, as much misconceived by the beginner
as the use of the negative sign.
on the negative sign, etc. 121
Take any fraction a
b
. Suppose its numerator to remain
the same, but its denominator to decrease, by which means
the fraction itself is increased. For example, 5
12
is greater
than 5
20
or the twelfth part of 5 is greater than its twentieth
part. Similarly,
2
1
2
4
1
6
is greater than
2
1
2
27
2
, etc. If, then, b be
diminished more and more, the fraction a
b
becomes greater
and greater, and there is no limit to its possible increase.
To show this, suppose that b is a part of a, or that b =
a
m
.
Then a
b
or
a
a
m
is m. Now since b may diminish so as to be
equal to any part of a, however small, that is, so as to make
m any number, however great, a
b
which is = m may be any
number however great. This diminution of b, and the consequent
increase of a
b
, may be carried on to any extent, which
we may state in these words: As the quantity b becomes
nearer and nearer to 0, the fraction a
b
increases, and in the
interval in which b passes from its first magnitude to 0, the
fraction a
b
passes from its first value through every possible
greater number. Now, suppose that the solution of a problem
in its most general form is a
b
, but that in one particular
case of that problem b is = 0. We have then instead of a
solution a
0
, a symbol to which we have not hitherto given a
on the study of mathematics. 122
meaning.
To take an instance: return to the problem of the two
couriers, and suppose that they move in the same direction
from C to D (Case first) at the same rate, or that m = n.
We find that AH =
ma
m - n
or
ma
n - m
or
ma
0
. On looking
at the equation which produced this result we find that it
becomes x
m
=
x - a
m
, or x = x - a, which is impossible. On
looking at the manner in which this equation was formed,
we find that it was made on the supposition that A and B
are together at some point, which in this case is also impossible,
since if they move at the same rate, the same distance
which separated them at one moment will separate them at
any other, and they will never be together, nor will they ever
have been together on the other side of A. The conclusion
to be drawn is, that such an equation as x =
a
0
indicates
that the supposition from which x was deduced can never
hold good. Nevertheless in the common language of algebra
it is said that they meet at an infinite distance, and that
a
0
is infinite. This phrase is one which in its literal meaning
is an absurdity, since there is no such thing as an infinite
number, that is a number which is greater than any other,
because the mind can set no bounds to the magnitude of the
numbers which it can conceive, and whatever number it can
imagine, however great, it can imagine the next to it. But
as the use of the phrase is very general, the only method
is to attach a meaning which shall not involve absurdity or
on the negative sign, etc. 123
confusion of ideas. The phrase used is this: When c = b,
a
c - b
=
a
0
and is infinitely great. The student should always
recollect that this is an abbreviation of the following
sentence. “The fraction a
c - b
becomes greater and greater
as c approaches more and more near to b; and if c, setting
out from a certain value, should change gradually until it
becomes equal to b, the fraction a
c - b
setting out also from
a certain value, will attain any magnitude however great, before
c becomes equal to b.” That is, before a fraction can
assume the form a
0
, it must increase without limit. The symbol
8 is used to denote such a fraction, or in general any
quantity which increases without limit. The following equation
will tend to elucidate the use of this symbol. In the
problem of the two couriers, the equation which gave the result
ma
0
was
x
m
=
x - a
m
, or x = x - a, which is evidently
impossible. Nevertheless, the larger x is taken the more near
is this equation to the truth, as may be proved by dividing
both sides by x, when it becomes 1 = 1 -
a
x
, which is never
exactly true. But the fraction a
x
decreases as x increases, and
by taking x sufficiently great may be reduced to any degree
of smallness. For example, if it is required that a
x
should be
as small as 1
10000000
of a unit, take x as great as 10000000a,
and the fraction becomes a
10000000a
, or
1
10000000
. But as
on the study of mathematics. 124
a
x
becomes smaller and smaller, the equation 1 = 1 -
a
x
becomes
nearer and nearer the truth, which is expressed by
saying that when 1 = 1 -
a
x
, or x = x - a, the solution is
x = 8. In the solution of the problem of the two couriers
this does not appear to hold good, since when m = n and
x =
ma
0
the same distance a always separates them, and no
travelling will bring them nearer together. To show what is
meant by saying that the greater x is, the nearer will it be
a solution of the problem, suppose them to have travelled at
the same rate to a great distance from C. They can never
come together unless CA becomes equal to CB, or A coincides
with B, which never happens, since the distance AB
is always the same. But if we suppose that they have met,
though an error always will arise from this false supposition,
it will become less and less as they travel farther and farther
from C. For example, let CA = 10000000AB, then the supposing
that they have met, or that B and A coincide, or that
BA = 0, is an error which involves no more than 1
10000000
of AC; and though AB is always of the same numerical magnitude,
it grows smaller and smaller in comparison with AC,
as the latter grows greater and greater.
Let us suppose now that in the problem of the two couriers
they move in the same direction at the same rate, as in
on the negative sign, etc. 125
the case we have just considered, but that moreover they
set out from the same point, that is, let a = 0. It is now
evident that they will always be together, that is, that any
value of x whatever is an answer to the question. On looking
at the value of AH, or
ma
m - n
, we find the numerator and
denominator both equal to 0, and the value of AH appears
in the form 0
0
. But from the problem we have found that one
value cannot be assigned to AH, since every point of their
course is a point where they are together. The solution of
the following equation will further elucidate this. Let
ax + by = c,
dx + ey = f,
from which, by the common method of solution, we find
x =
ce - bf
ae - bd, y =
af - cd
ae - bd .
Now, let us suppose that ce = bf and ae = bd. Dividing the
first of these by the second, we find
ce
ae
=
bf
bd , or
c
a
=
f
d
, or cd = af.
The values both of x and y in this case assume the form 0
0
;
to find the cause of this we must return to the equations. If
we divide the first of these by c, and the second by f, we
on the study of mathematics. 126
find that
a
c
x +
b
c
y = 1,
d
f
x +
e
f
y = 1.
But the equations ce = bf and cd = af give us
b
c
=
e
f
and a
c
=
d
f
, that is, these two are, in fact, one and the
same equation repeated, from which, as has been explained
before, an infinite number of values of x and y can be found;
in fact, any value may be given to x provided y be then found
from the equation. We see that in these instances, when the
value of any quantity appears in the form 0
0
, that quantity
admits of an infinite number of values, and this indicates
that the conditions given to determine that quantity are not
sufficient. But this is not the only cause of the appearance
of a fraction in the form 0
0
. Take the identical equation
a
2 - b
2
c(a - b)
=
a + b
c
.
When a approaches towards b, a + b approaches towards 2b,
and a
2 - b
2 and a - b approach more and more nearly towards
0. If a = b the equation assumes this form:
0
0
=
2b
c
.
on the negative sign, etc. 127
This may be explained thus: if we multiply the numerator
and denominator of the fraction A
B
by a - b (which does
not alter its value) it becomes Aa - Ab
Ba - Bb. If in the course of
an investigation this has been done when the two quantities
a and b are equal to one another, the fraction A
B
or
Aa - Ab
Ba - Bb
will appear in the form 0
0
. But since the result would have
been A
B
had that multiplication not been performed, this
last fraction must be used instead of the unmeaning form 0
0
.
Thus the fraction a
2 - b
2
c(a - b)
or
(a + b)(a - b)
c(a - b)
is the fraction
a + b
c
after its numerator and denominator have been
multiplied by a-b, and may be used in all cases except that
in which a = b. When the form 0
0
occurs, the problem must
be carefully examined in order to ascertain the reason.
CHAPTER X.
EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE.
Every operation of algebra is connected with another which
is exactly opposite to it in its effects. Thus addition and subtraction,
multiplication and division, are reverse operations,
that is, what is done by the one is undone by the other. Thus
a + b - b is a, and ab
b
is a. Now in connexion with the raising
of powers is a contrary operation called the extraction of
roots. The term root is thus explained: We have seen that
aa, or a
2
, is called the square of a; from which a is called
the square root of a
2
. As 169 is called the square of 13, 13 is
called the square root of 169. The following table will show
how this phraseology is carried on.
a is called the square root of a
2
, denoted by v

equations of the second degree. 129
The usual method of proceeding is to teach the student
to extract the square root of any algebraical quantity immediately
after the solution of equations of the first degree. We
would rather recommend him to omit this rule until he is acquainted
with the solution of equations of the second degree,
except in the cases to which we now proceed. In arithmetic,
it must be observed that there are comparatively very few
numbers of which the square root can be extracted. For
example, 7 is not made by the multiplication either of any
whole number or fraction by itself. The first is evident; the
second cannot be readily proved to the beginner, but he may,
by taking a number of instances, satisfy himself of this, that
no fraction which is really such, that is whose numerator is
not measured by its denominator, will give a whole number
when multiplied by itself, thus 4
2 ×
4
3
or 16
9
is not a whole
number, and so on. The number 7, therefore, is neither the
square of a whole number, nor of a fraction, and, properly
speaking, has no square root. Nevertheless, fractions can be
found extremely near to 7, which have square roots, and this
degree of nearness may be carried to any extent we please.
Thus, if required, between 7 and 7 1
1000000000 could be found a
fraction which has a square root, and the fraction in the last
might be decreased to any extent whatever, so that though
we cannot find a fraction whose square is 7, we may nevertheless
find one whose square is as near to 7 as we please.
To take another example, if we multiply 1.4142 by itself the
product is 1.99996164, which only differs from 2 by the very
small fraction .00003836, so that the square of 1.4142 is very
on the study of mathematics. 130
nearly 2, and fractions might be found whose squares are still
nearer to 2. Let us now suppose the following problem. A
man buys a certain number of yards of stuff for two shillings,
and the number of yards which he gets is exactly the number
of shillings which he gives for a yard. How many yards does
he buy? Let x be this number, then 2
x
is the price of one
yard, and x =
2
x
or x
2 = 2. This, from what we have said,
is impossible, that is, there is no exact number of yards,
or parts of yards, which will satisfy the conditions; nevertheless,
1.4142 yards will nearly do it, 1.4142136 still more
nearly, and if the problem were ever proposed in practice,
there would be no difficulty in solving it with sufficient nearness
for any purpose. A problem, therefore, whose solution
contains a square root which cannot be extracted, maybe
rendered useful by approximation to the square root.
Equations of the second degree, commonly called
quadratic equations, are those in which there is the second
power, or square of an unknown quantity: such as
x
2 - 3 = 4x
2 - 15, x
2 + 3x = 2x
2 - x - 1, etc. By transposition
of their terms, they may always be reduced to one of
the following forms:
ax2 + b = 0,
ax2 - b = 0,
ax2 + bx + c = 0,
ax2 - bx + c = 0,
equations of the second degree. 131
ax2 + bx - c = 0,
ax2 - bx - c = 0.
For example, the two equations given above, are equivalent
to 3x
2 - 12 = 0, and x
2 - 4x - 1 = 0, which agree in form
with the second and last. In order to proceed to each of these
equations, first take the equation x
2 = a
2
. This equation is
the same as x
2 - a
2 = 0, or (x + a)(x - a) = 0. Now, in
order that the product of two or more quantities may be
equal to nothing, it is sufficient that one of those quantities
be nothing, and therefore a value of x may be derived from
either of the following equations:
x - a = 0,
or x + a = 0,
the first of which gives x = a, and the second x = -a. To
elucidate this, find x from the following equation:
(3x + a)(a
3 + x
3
) = (x
2 + ax)(a
2 + ax + 2x
2
);
develop this equation, and transpose all its terms on one
side, when it becomes
x
4 - 2a
2x
2 + a
4 + 2a
3x - 2ax3 = 0,
or (x
2 - a
2
)
2 - 2ax(x
2 - a
2
) = 0,
or (x
2 - a
2
)(x
2 - 2ax - a
2
) = 0.
This last equation is true when x
2-a
2 = 0, or when x
2 = a
2
,
which is true either when x = +a, or x = -a. If in the
on the study of mathematics. 132
original equation +a is substituted instead of x, the result
is 4a × 2a
3 = 2a
2 × 4a
2
; if -a be substituted instead of x,
the result is 0 = 0, which show that +a and -a are both
correct values of x. We have here noticed, for the first time,
an equation of condition which is capable of being solved by
more than one value of x. We have found two, and shall find
more when we can solve the equation x
2 - 2ax - a
2 = 0, or
x
2 -2ax = a
2
. Every equation of the second degree, if it has
one value of x, has a second, of which x
2 = a
2
is an instance,
where x = ±a, in which by the double sign ± is meant, that
either of them may be used at pleasure. We now proceed to
the solution of ax2 - bx + c = 0. In order to understand the
nature of this equation, let us suppose that we take for x
such a value, that ax2 - bx + c, instead of being equal to 0,
is equal to y, that is
y = ax2 - bx + c,*
(1)
in which the value of y depends upon the value given to x,
and changes when x changes. Let m be one of those quantities
which, when substituted instead of x, makes ax2 -bx+c
equal to nothing, in which case m is called a root of the
equation,
ax2 - bx + c = 0, (2)
*
In the investigations which follow, a, b, and c are considered as
having the sign which is marked before them, and no change of form is
supposed to take place.
equations of the second degree. 133
and it follows that
am2 - bm + c = 0. (3)
Subtract (3) from (1), the result of which is
y = a(x
2 - m2
) - b(x - m) = (x - m)(a x + m - b).
Here y is evidently equal to 0, when x = m, as we might
expect from the supposition which we made; but it is also
nothing when a(x + m) - b = 0; there is, therefore, another
value of x, for which y = 0; if we call this n we find it from
the equation a(n + m) - b = 0,
or n + m =
b
a
. (4)
In (3) substitute for b its value derived from (4), from which
b = a(n + m); it then becomes
am2 - am(n + m) + c = 0, or c - amn = 0,
which gives
mn =
c
a
. (5)
Substitute in (1) the values of b and c derived from
(4) and (5), which gives
y = ax2 - a(m + n)x + amn
= a(x
2 - m + n x + mn).
on the study of mathematics. 134
Now the second factor of this expression arises from multiplying
together x - m and x - n; therefore,
y = a(x - m)(x - n). (6)
To take an example of this, let y = 4x
2 - 5x + 1. Here when
x = 1, y = 4 - 5 + 1 = 0, and therefore m = 1. If we
divide 4x
2 - 5x + 1 by x - 1, the quotient (which is without
remainder) is 4x - 1, and therefore
y = (x - 1)(4x - 1).
This is also nothing when 4x-1 = 0, or when x is 1
4
. Therefore
n =
1
4
, and y = 4(x - 1)(x -
1
4
), a result coinciding with
that of (6). If, therefore, we can find one of the values of x
which satisfy the equation ax2 - bx + c = 0, we can find the
other and can divide ax2 - bx + c into the factors a, x - m
and x - n, or
ax2 - bx + c = a(x - m)(x - n).
If we multiply x + m by x + n, the only difference between
(x + m)(x + n) and (x - m)(x - n) is in the sign of the term
which contains the first power of x. If, therefore,
ax2 - bx + c = a(x - m)(x - n),
it follows that
ax2 + bx + c = a(x + m)(x + n).
equations of the second degree. 135
We now take the expression ax2 - bx - c. If there is one
value of x which will make this quantity equal to 0, let this
be m, and let
y = ax2 - bx - c.
Then
0 = am2 - bm - c,
from which
y = a(x
2 - m2
) - b(x - m)
= (x - m)(a x + m - b)
= (x - m)(ax + am - b).
Let am - b
a
be called n, or let am - b = an; then
y = (x - m)(ax + an)
= a(x - m)(x + n).
As an example, it may be shown that
3x
2 - x - 2 = 3(x - 1)(x +
2
3
).
Again, with regard to ax2 + bx - c, since (x + m)(x - n)
only differs from (x - m)(x + n)) in the sign of the term
which contains the first power of x, it is evident that
if ax2 - bx - c = a(x - m)(x + n),
ax2 + bx - c = a(x + m)(x - n).
on the study of mathematics. 136
Results similar to those of the first case may be obtained
for all the others, and these results may be arranged in the
following way. In the first and third, m is a quantity, which,
when substituted for x, makes y = 0, and in the second and
fourth m and n are the same as in the first and third.
1st y = ax2 - bx + c = a(x - m)(x - n),
m + n =
b
a
, mn =
c
a
.
2d y = ax2 + bx + c = a(x + m)(x + n),
m + n =
b
a
, mn =
c
a
.
3d y = ax2 - bx - c = a(x - m)(x + n),
m - n =
b
a
, mn =
c
a
.
4th y = ax2 + bx - c = a(x + m)(x - n),
m - n =
b
a
, mn =
c
a
.
We must now inquire in what cases a value can be found
for x, which will make y = 0 in these different expressions,
and in this consists the solution of equations of the second
degree.
Let
y = ax2 - bx + c, (1)
and observe that (2ax - b)
2 = 4a
2x
2 - 4abx + b
2
. Multiply
both sides of (1) by 4a, which gives
4ay = 4a
2x
2 - 4abx + 4ac. (2)
equations of the second degree. 137
Add b
2
to the first two terms of the second side of (2), and
subtract it from the third, which will not alter the whole,
and this gives
4ay = 4a
2x
2-4abx+b
2+4ac-b
2 = (2ax-b)
2+ac-b
2
. (3)
Now it must be recollected that the square of any quantity
is positive whether that quantity is positive or negative.
This has been already sufficiently explained in saying
that a change of the form of any expression does not change
the form of its square. Common multiplication shows that
(c - d)
2 and (d - c)
2 are the same thing; and, since one
of these must be positive, the other must be also positive.
Whenever, therefore, we wish to say that a quantity is positive,
it can be done by supposing it equal to the square of an
algebraical quantity. In equation (3) there are three distinct
cases to be considered.
I. When b
2
is greater than 4ac, that is, when b
2 - 4ac is
positive, let b
2 - 4ac = k
2
, which expresses the condition.
Then
4ay = (2ax - b)
2 - k
2
, (4)
and we determine those values of x, which make y = 0, from
the equation,
(2ax - b)
2 - k
2 = 0.
We have already solved such an equation, and we find
that
2ax - b = ±k,
on the study of mathematics. 138
where either sign may be taken. This shows that y or
ax2 - bx + c is equal to nothing either when
instead of x is put
b + k
2a
=
b +
v
b
2 - 4ac
2a
= m,
or
b - k
2a

b -
v
b
2 - 4ac
2a
= n,
the second values being formed by putting, instead of k its
value v
b
2 - 4ac. They are both positive quantities, because
k
2 being equal to b
2 - 4ac is less than b
2
, and therefore k is
less than b, and therefore b + k
2a
and b - k
2a
are both positive.
These are the quantities which we have called m and n in
the former investigations, and, therefore,

Actual multiplication of the factors will show that this is an
identical equation.
II. When b
2
, instead of being greater than 4ac, is equal
to it, or when b
2 -4ac = 0 and k = 0. In this case the values
of m and n are equal, each being b

In this case y is said, in algebra, to be a perfect square,
since its square root can be extracted, and is v
a

x -
b
2a

.
Arithmetically speaking, this would not be a perfect square
unless a was a number whose square root could be extracted,
but in algebra it is usual to call any quantity a perfect square
with respect to any letter, which, when reduced, does not
contain that letter under the sign v
. This result is one
which often occurs, and it must be recollected that when
b
2 - 4ac = 0, ax2 - bx + c is a perfect square.
III. When b
2
is less than 4ac, or when b
2 -4ac is negative
and 4ac - b
2 positive, let 4ac - b
2 = k
2
, and equation (3)
becomes
4ay = (2ax - b)
2 + k
2
.
In this case no value of x can ever make y = 0, for the
equation v
2 + w
2 = 0 indicates that v
2
is equal to w
2 with
a contrary sign, which cannot be, since all squares have the
same sign. The values of x are said, in this case, to be
impossible, and it indicates that there is something absurd
or contradictory in the conditions of a problem which leads
to such a result.
Having found that whenever
ax2 - bx + c = a(x - m)(x - n),
it follows that ax2 + bx + c = a(x + m)(x + n), we know that

As before,

= (2ax - b)

Let b

Therefore y is 0 when (2ax - b)

Now, because b

the present, the consideration of the negative quantity, we
may decompose (3) into factors by means of the general formula

These four cases may be contained in one, if we apply
those rules for the change of signs which we have already
established. For example, the first side of (C) is made from
that of (A) by changing the sign of c; the second side of (C)
is made from that of (A) in the same way. We have also seen
the necessity of taking into account the negative quantities
which satisfy an equation, as well as the positive ones; if we
take these into account, each of the four forms of ax2 + bx +
c can be made equal to nothing by two values of x. For
example, in (1), when
ax2 + bx + c = 0,
either x +

and in all the four cases the form of ax2 + bx + c which is
used, is the same as the corresponding form of
a(x - m)(x - n)
and the following results may be easily obtained. In (A0
)
both m and n, if they exist at all, are negative. I say, if they
exist at all, because it has been shown that if b
2 - 4ac is
negative, the quantity ax2 + bx + c cannot be divided into
factors at all, since v
b
2 - 4ac is then no algebraical quantity,
either positive or negative.
In (B0
) both, if they exist at all, are positive.
In (C
0
) there are always real values for m and n, since
b
2 + 4ac is always positive; one of these values is positive,
and the other negative, and the negative one is numerically
the greatest.
In (D0
) there are also real values of m and n, one positive
and the other negative, of which the positive one is numerically
the greatest. Before proceeding any further, we must
notice an extension of a phrase which is usually adopted.
equations of the second degree. 145
The words greater and less, as applied to numbers, offer no
difficulty, and from them we deduce, that if a be greater
than b, a - c is greater than b - c, as long as these subtractions
are possible, that is, as long as c can be taken both
from a and b. This is the only case which was considered
when the rule was made, but in extending the meaning of
the word subtraction, and using the symbol -3 to stand for
5-8, the principle that if a be greater than b, a-c is greater
than b - c, leads to the following results. Since 6 is greater
than 4, 6-12 is greater than 4-12, or -6 is greater than -8;
again 6 - 6 is greater than 4 - 6, or 0 is greater than -2.
These results, particularly the last, are absurd, as has been
noticed, if we continue to mean by the terms greater and
less, nothing more than is usually meant by them in arithmetic;
but in extending the meaning of one term, we must
extend the meaning of all which are connected with it, and
we are obliged to apply the terms greater and less in the following
way. Of two algebraical quantities with the same or
different signs, that one is the greater which, when both are
connected with a number numerically greater than either of
them, gives the greater result. Thus -6 is said to be greater
than -8, because 20 - 6 is greater than 20 - 8, 0 is greater
than -4, because 6 + 0 is greater than 6 - 4; +12 is greater
than -30, because 40+12 is greater than 40-30. Nevertheless
-30 is said to be numerically greater than +12, because
the number contained in the first is greater than that in the
second. For this reason it was said, that in (C), the negative
quantity was numerically greater, than the positive, because
on the study of mathematics. 146
any positive quantity is in algebra called greater than any
negative one, even though the number contained in the first
should be less than that in the second. In the same way
-14 is said to lie between +3 and -20, being less than the
first and greater than the second. The advantage of these
extensions is the same as that of others; the disadvantage
attached to them, which it is not fair to disguise, is that,
if used without proper caution, they lead the student into
erroneous notions, which some elementary works, far from
destroying, confirm, and even render necessary, by adopting
these very notions as definitions; as for example, when they
say that a negative quantity is one which is less than nothing;
as if there could be such a thing, the usual meaning of
the word less being considered, and as if the student had an
idea of a quantity less than nothing already in his mind, to
which it was only necessary to give a name.
The product (x-m)(x-n) is positive when (x-m) and
(x-n) have the same, and negative when they have different
signs. This last can never happen except when x lies between
m and n, that is, when x is algebraically greater than the
one, and less than the other. The following table will exhibit
this, where different products are taken with various signs of
m and n, and three values are given to x one after the other,
the first of which is less than both m and n, the second
between both, and the third greater than both.
The student will see the reason of this, and perform a
useful exercise in making two or three tables of this description
for himself. The result is that (x-m)(x-n) is negative

when x lies between m and n; is nothing when x is either
equal to m or to n, and positive when x is greater than both,
or less than both. Consequently, a(x - m)(x - n) has the
same sign as a when x is greater than both m and n, or less
than both, and a different sign from a when x lies between
both. But whatever may be the signs of a, b, and c, if there
are two quantities m and n, which make
ax2 + bx + c = a(x - m)(x - n),
that is, if the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has real roots, the
expression ax2 + bx + c always has the same sign as a for all
values of x, except when x lies between these roots.
It only remains to consider those cases in which
ax2 + bx + c cannot be decomposed into different factors,
on the study of mathematics. 148
which happens whenever b
2 - 4ac is 0, or negative. In the

and as these expressions are composed of factors, one of
which is a square, and therefore positive, they have always
the same sign as the other factor, which is a. When
b
2 - 4ac is negative, we have proved that if y = ax2 ± bx + c,
4ay = (2ax ± b)
2 + k
2
, where k
2 = 4ac - b
2
, and therefore
4ay being the sum of two squares is always positive, that
is, ax2 ± bx + c has the same sign as a, whatever may
be the value of x. When c = 0, the expression becomes
ax2 + bx, or x(ax + b), which is nothing either when x = 0,
or when ax + b = 0 and x = -

for m and n become in this case -b +

and -b -

which give the same results.
When b = 0, the expression is reduced to ax2 + c = 0,

The same result might be deduced by making b = 0 in the
general expressions for m and n.
When a = 0, the expression is reduced to bx + c, which
is made equal to nothing by one value of x only, that
is -
c
b
. If we take the general expressions for m and n,
and make a = 0 in them, that is, in -b +

and -

. These
have been already explained. The first may either indicate
that any value of x will solve the problem which produced
the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, or that we have applied a
rule to a case which was not contemplated in its formation,
and have thereby created a factor in the numerator and
denominator of x, which, in attempting to apply the rule,
becomes equal to nothing. The student is referred to the
problem of the two couriers, solved in the preceding part of
this treatise. The latter is evidently the case here, because
in returning to the original equation, we find it reduced to
bx + c = 0, which gives a rational value for x, namely, -
c
b
.
The second value, or -
2b

, which in algebraical language
is called infinite, may indicate, that though there is no
other value of x, except -
c
b
, which solves the equation,
on the study of mathematics. 150
still that the greater the number which is taken for x, the
more nearly is a second solution obtained. The use of
these expressions is to point out the cases in which there is
anything remarkable in the general problem; to the problem
itself we must resort for further explanation.
The importance of the investigations connected with the
expression ax2 + bx + c, can hardly be overrated, at least to
those students who pursue mathematics to any extent. In
the higher branches, great familiarity with these results is
indispensable. The student is therefore recommended not to
proceed until he has completely mastered the details here
given, which have been hitherto too much neglected in English
works on algebra.
In solving equations of the second degree, we have obtained
a new species of result, which indicates that the problem
cannot be solved at all. We refer to those results which
contain the square root of a negative quantity. We find that
by multiplication the squares of c - d and of d - c are the
same, both being c
2 - 2cd + d
2
. Now either c - d or d - c
is positive, and since they both have the same square, it appears
that the squares of all quantities, whether positive or
negative, are positive. It is therefore absurd to suppose that
there is any quantity which x can represent, and which satisfies
the equation x
2 = -a
2
, since that would be supposing
that x
2
, a positive quantity, is equal to the negative quantity
-a
2
. The solution is then said to be impossible, and it
will be easy to show an instance in which such a result is
obtained, and also to show that it arises from the absurdity
equations of the second degree. 151
of the problem.
Let a number a be divided into any two parts, one of
which is greater than the half, and the other less. Call the
first of these a
2
+x, then the second must be a
2
-x, since the
sum of both parts must be a. Multiply these parts together,
which gives

+ x
a

- x

, or 
a
2
2

2
.
As x diminishes, this product increases, and is greatest of
all when x = 0, that is, when the two parts, into which a is
divided, are a
2
and a
2
, or when the number a is halved. In this
case the product of the parts is a
2
×
a
2
, or
a
2
4
, and a number a
can never be divided into two parts whose product is greater
than a
2
4
. This being premised, suppose that we attempt to
divide the number a into two parts, whose product is b. Let
x be one of these parts, then a - x is the other, and their
product is ax - x
2
.
We have, therefore,
ax - x
2 = b,
or x
2 - ax + b = 0.
If we solve this equation, the two roots are the two parts
required, since from what we have proved of the expression
on the study of mathematics. 152

which are impossible when a

, which agrees with what has just been
proved, that no number is capable of being divided into two
parts whose product is greater than a
2
4
.
We have shown the symbol v
-a to be void of meaning,
or rather self-contradictory and absurd. Nevertheless, by
means of such symbols, a part of algebra is established which
is of great utility. It depends upon the fact, which must be
verified by experience, that the common rules of algebra may
be applied to these expressions without leading to any false
results. An appeal to experience of this nature appears to
be contrary to the first principles laid down at the beginning
of this work. We cannot deny that it is so in reality, but it
must be recollected that this is but a small and isolated part
of an immense subject, to all other branches of which these
principles apply in their fullest extent. There have not been
wanting some to assert that these symbols may be used as

rationally as any others, and that the results derived from
them are as conclusive as any reasoning could make them.
I leave the student to discuss this question as soon as he
has acquired sufficient knowledge to understand the various
arguments: at present let him proceed with the subject as a
part of the mechanism of algebra, on the assurance that by
careful attention to the rules laid down he can never be led to
any incorrect result. The simple rule is, apply all those rules
to such expressions as v
-a, a +
v
-b, etc., which have been
proved to hold good for such quantities as v
a, a +
v
b, etc.
Such expressions as the first of these are called imaginary,
to distinguish them from the second, which are called real;
and it must always be recollected that there is no quantity,
either positive or negative, which an imaginary expression
can represent.
It is usual to write such symbols as v
-b in a different
form. To the equation -b = b × (-1) apply the rule
derived from the equation vxy =
v
x ×
vy, which gives
v
-b =
v
b ×
v
-1, of which the first factor is real and the
second imaginary. Let v
b = c, then v
-b = c
v
-1. In this
way all expressions may be so arranged that v
-1 shall be
the only imaginary quantity which appears in them. Of
this reduction the following are examples:

is, let b

be substituted instead of k

, the result is 0. It appears, then,
that the imaginary expressions which take the place of the
roots when b
2 - 4ac is negative, will, if the ordinary rules
be applied, produce the same results as the roots. They
are thence called imaginary roots, and we say that every
equation of the second degree has two roots, either both
real or both imaginary. It is generally true, that wherever
an imaginary expression occurs the same results will follow
on the study of mathematics. 156
from the application of these expressions in any process as
would have followed had the proposed problem been possible
and its solution real.
When an equation arises in which imaginary and real
expressions occur together, such as a + b
v
-1 = c + d
v
-1,
when all the terms are transferred on one side, the part which
is real and that which is imaginary must each of them be
equal to nothing. The equation just given when its left side
is transposed becomes a - c + (b - d)
v
-1 = 0. Now, if
b is not equal to d, let b - d = e; then a - c + e
v
-1 = 0,
and v
-1 =
c - a
e
; that is, an imaginary expression is equal
to a real one, which is absurd. Therefore, b = d and the
original equation is thereby reduced to a = c. This goes on
the supposition that a, b, c, and d are real. If they are not
so there is no necessary absurdity in v
-1 =
c - a
e
. If, then,
we wish to express that two possible quantities a and b are
respectively equal to two others c and d, it may be done at
once by the equation
a + b
v
-1 = c + d
v
-1.
The imaginary expression v
-a and the negative expression
-b have this resemblance, that either of them occurring
as the solution of a problem indicates some inconsistency
or absurdity. As far as real meaning is concerned, both are
equally imaginary, since 0 - a is as inconceivable as v
-a.
What, then, is the difference of signification? The following
problems will elucidate this. A father is fifty-six, and his son
equations of the second degree. 157
twenty-nine years old: when will the father be twice as old as
the son? Let this happen x years from the present time; then
the age of the father will be 56+x, and that of the son 29+x;
and therefore, 56 +x = 2(29 +x) = 58 + 2x, or x = -2. The
result is absurd; nevertheless, if in the equation we change
the sign of x throughout it becomes 56 - x = 58 - 2x, or
x = 2. This equation is the one belonging to the problem:
a father is 56 and his son 29 years old; when was the father
twice as old as the son? the answer to which is, two years
ago. In this case the negative sign arises from too great a
limitation in the terms of the problem, which should have demanded
how many years have elapsed or will elapse before
the father is twice as old as his son?
Again, suppose the problem had been given in this lastmentioned
way. In order to form an equation, it will be
necessary either to suppose the event past or future. If of
the two suppositions we choose the wrong one, this error will
be pointed out by the negative form of the result. In this case
the negative result will arise from a mistake in reducing the
problem to an equation. In either case, however, the result
may be interpreted, and a rational answer to the question
may be given. This, however, is not the case in a problem,
the result of which is imaginary. Take the instance above
solved, in which it is required to divide a into two parts,
whose product is b. The resulting equation is

and the roots of the second are imaginary, if those of the
first are so. There is, then, this distinct difference between
the negative and the imaginary result. When the answer
to a problem is negative, by changing the sign of x in the
equation which produced that result, we may either discover
an error in the method of forming that equation or show
that the question of the problem is too limited, and may be
extended so as to admit of a satisfactory answer. When the
answer to a problem is imaginary this is not the case.
CHAPTER XI.
ON ROOTS IN GENERAL, AND LOGARITHMS.
The meaning of the terms square root, cube root, fourth root,
etc., has already been defined. We now proceed to the difficulties
attending the connexion of the roots of a with the
powers of a. The following table will refresh the memory of
the student with respect to the meaning of the terms:
NAME OF x. NAME OF x.
Square of a x = aa Square Root of a xx = a
Cube of a x = aaa Cube Root of a xxx = a
Fourth Power of a x = aaaa Fourth Root of a xxxx = a
Fifth Power of a x = aaaaa Fifth Root of a xxxxx = a
The different powers and roots of a have hitherto been
expressed in the following way:
Powers a

which series are connected together by the following equation,
(vn a)
n = a.
There has hitherto been no connexion between the manner
of expressing powers and roots, and we have found no
properties which are common both to powers and roots.
Nevertheless, by the extension of rules, we shall be led to

a method of denoting the raising of powers, the extraction
of roots, and combinations of the two, to which algebra has
been most peculiarly indebted, and the importance of which
will justify the length at which it will be treated here.
Suppose it required to find the cube of 2a
2

; that is, to
find 2a
2
b
3 × 2a

give, as the result, 8a

9
, which is expressed in the
following equation,
(2a
2
b

)
3 = 8a

and the general rule by which any single term may be raised
to the power whose index is n, is: Raise the coefficient to the
power n, and multiply the index of every letter by n, that is,
(a
p
b
q
c
r
)
n = a
npb
nqc
nr
.
In extracting the root of any simple term, we are guided
by the manner in which the corresponding power is found.
The rule is: Extract the required root of the coefficient, and
divide the index of each letter by the index of the root.
Where these divisions do not give whole numbers as the quotients,
the expression whose root is to be extracted does not

admit of the extraction without the introduction of some new
symbol. For example, extract the fourth root of 16a
12b
8
c
4
,
or find v4
16a
12b
8c

. The expression here given is the same as
the following:
2a

b
2
c × 2a
3

2
c × 2a

or (2a
3
b
2
c)
4
, the fourth root of which is 2a
3
b
2
c, conformably
to the rule.
Any root of a product, such as AB, may be extracted
by extracting the root of each of its factors. Thus, v3 AB = v3 A
v3 B. For, raise v3 A
v3 B to the third power, the result of
which is,
v3 A
v3 B ×
v3 A
v3 B ×
v3 A
v3 B,
or v3 A
v3 A
v3 A ×
v3 B
v3 B
v3 B,
or AB.
In the same way it may be proved generally, that
vn ABC =
vn A
vn B
vn C. The most simple way of representing
any root of any expression is the dividing it into two factors,
one of which is the highest which it admits of whose root can
be extracted by the rule just given. For example, in finding
v3
16a
4b
7c we must observe that 16 is 8 × 2, a
4
is a
3 × a, b
7
is
b
6 × b, and the expression is 8a
3
b
6 × 2abc, the cube root of
which, found by extracting the cube root of each factor, is
2ab2
v3
2abc. The second factor has no cube root which can be
expressed by means of the symbols hitherto used, but when
on the study of mathematics. 162
the numbers which a, b, and c stand for are known, v3
2abc
maybe found either exactly, or, when that is not possible, by
approximation.
We find that a power of a power is found by affixing,
as an index, the product of the indices of the two powers.
Thus (a
2
)
4 or a
2 × a
2 × a
2 × a
2
is a
8
, or a
4×2
. This is the
same as (a
4
)
2
, which is a
4 × a
4
, or a
8
. Therefore, generally
(a
m)
n = (a
n
)
m = a
mn. In the same manner, a root of a root
is the root whose index is the product of the indices of the
two roots. Thus
3
qv2
a =
v6
a.
For since a =
v6 a
v6 a
v6 a ×
v6 a
v6 a
v6 a, the square root of a
is v6 a
v6 a
v6 a, the cube root of which is v3 a. This is the same
as p2 v3 a, and generally
m
qvn
a =
n
q vm a =
mnv
a.
Again, when a power is raised and a root extracted, it
is indifferent which is done first. Thus v3
a
2
is the same
thing as (v3 a)
2
. For since a
2 = a × a, the cube root may be
found by taking the cube root of each of these factors, that
is v3
a
2 =
v3 a ×
v3 a = (v3 a)

vn

To prove this, recollect that

.
But a
mp is (a
m)
p
, and by definition pp
(am)
p = a
m. Therefore
npv
amp =
vn
am. This multiplication is equivalent to raising a
power of vn
am, and afterwards reducing the result to its former
value, by extracting the correspending root, in the same
way as
mp
np
signifies that m
n
has been multiplied by p, and
the result has been restored to its former value by dividing
it by p.

laid down.

The quantity vn

divided by n, without remainder, for example v2
a
12 = a
6
, v5
a
20 = a

, and in general, whenever m can be divided by n
on the study of mathematics. 164
without remainder, vn
am = a
m
n . This symbol, viz., a letter
which has an exponent appearing in a fractional form, has
not hitherto been used. We may give it any meaning which
we please, provided it be such that when m
n
is fractional in
form only, and not in reality, that is, when m is divisible by n,
and the quotient is p, a
m
n shall stand for a
p
, or aaa . . .(p).*
It
will be convenient to let a
m
n always stand for vn
am, in which
case the condition alluded to is fulfilled, since when m
n
= p,
a
m
n or vn
am = a

. This extension of a rule, the advantages of
which will soon be apparent, is exemplified in the following
table, which will familiarise the student with the different
cases of this new notation:

The results at which we have arrived in this chapter,
translated into this new language, are as follows:

n = (x

The advantages resulting from the adoption of this notation,
are, (1) that time is saved in writing algebraical expressions;
(2) all rules which have been shown to hold good for
performing operations upon such quantities as a
m, hold good
also for performing the same operations upon such quantities
as a
m
n , in which the exponents are fractional. The truth
of this last assertion we proceed to establish.
Suppose it required to multiply together a
m
n and a
l
n , or
vn
am and vn
a
l
. From (2) this is vn
am × a
l
, or vn
am+l
, or a
m+l
n .
Suppose it now required to multiply a
m
n and a
p
q . From (5)
the first of these is the same as a
mq
nq , and the second is the
same as a
np
nq . The product of these by the last case is a
mq+np
nq ,

or
nqv
amq+np. But mq + np

n
+
p
q
, and therefore
a
m
n × a
p
q = a
m
n +
p
q . (6)
This is the same result as was obtained when the indices
were whole numbers. The rule is: To multiply together two
powers of the same quantity, add the indices, and make the
sum the index of the product. It follows in the same way
that
a
m
n
a
p
q
= a

or, to divide one power of a quantity by another, subtract
the index of the divisor from that of the dividend, and make
the difference the index of the result.

that a

q = a
m

or
x

=

Again to find (a

p

(a

rules, and it appears that (a
m

p = a

a

n = a

Therefore (a

The rule is: To raise one power of a quantity to another
power, multiply the indices of the two powers together, and
roots in general, and logarithms. 167
make the product the index of the result. All these rules
are exactly those which have been shown to hold good when
the indices are whole numbers. But there still remains one
remarkable extension, which will complete this subject.
We have proved that whether m and n be whole or fractional
numbers, a
n
am
= a
m-n
. The only cases which have
been considered in forming this rule are those in which m is
greater than n, being the only ones in which the subtraction
indicated is possible. If we apply the rule to any other
case, a new symbol is produced, which we proceed to consider.
For example, suppose it required to find a
3
a
7
. If we
apply the rule, we find the result a
3-7
, or a
-4
, for which we
have hitherto no meaning. As in former cases, we must apply
other methods to the solution of this case, and when we
have obtained a rational result, a
-4 may be used in future
to stand for this result. Now the fraction a
3
a
7
is the same
as
1
a
4
, which is obtained by dividing both its numerator and
denominator by a
3
. Therefore 1
a
4
is the rational result, for
which we have obtained a
-4 by applying a rule in too extensive
a manner. Nevertheless, if a
-4 be made to stand for 1
a
4
,
and a
-m for 1
am
, the rule will always give correct results, and
the general rules for multiplication, division, and raising of
powers remain the same as before. For example, a
-m × a
-n
on the study of mathematics. 168
is
1
am
×
1
a
n
, or
1
ama
n
, which is 1
am+n
, or a
-(m+n)
, or a
-m-n
.
Similarly
a
-m
a
-n
, or
1
am
1
a
n
, is
a
n
am
, or a
n-m, or a
-m-(-n)
.
Again
(a
m)
-n
is
1
(am)
n
, or
1
amn
, or a
-mn
,
and so on.
It has before been shown that a
0
stands for 1 whenever it
occurs in the solution of a problem. We can now, therefore,
assign a meaning to the expression a
m, whether m be whole
or fractional, positive, negative, or nothing, and in all these
cases the following rules hold good:
a
m × a
n = a
m+n
,
a
m
a
n
= a
m-n = a
ma
-n
,
(a
m)
n = (a
n
)
m = a
mn
.
The student can now understand the meaning of such an
expression as 10.301, where the index or exponent is a decimal
fraction. Since .301 is 301
1000 , this stands for 1000p
(10)301, an
expression of which it would be impossible to calculate the
value by any method which the student has hitherto been
roots in general, and logarithms. 169
taught, but which may be shown by other processes to be
very nearly equal to 2.
Before proceeding to the practice of logarithmic calculations,
the student should thoroughly understand the meaning
of fractional and negative indices, and be familiar with
the operations performed by means of them. He should work
many examples of multiplication and division in which they
occur, for which he can have recourse to any elementary
work. The rules are the same as those to which he has been
accustomed, substituting the addition, subtraction, and so
forth, of fractional indices, instead of these which are whole
numbers.
In order to make use of logarithms, he must provide himself
with a table. Either of the following works may be recommended
to him:

tables of logarithms, see the Encyclopædia Britannica, Article

The limits of this treatise will not allow us to enter into
the subject of the definition, theory, and use of logarithms,
which will be found fully treated in the standard text-books
of Arithmetic, Algebra, and Trigonometry. There is, however,
one consideration connected with the tables, which, as
it involves a principle of frequent application, it will be well
to explain here. On looking into any table of logarithms it
will be seen, that for a series of numbers the logarithms increase
in arithmetical progression, as far as the first seven
places of decimals are concerned; that is, the difference between
the successive logarithms continues the same. For ex*The
original text of De Morgan, for which the above paragraph
has been substituted, reads as follows: “Either of the following works
may be recommended to him: (1) Taylor’s Logarithms. (2) Hutton’s
Logarithms. (3) Babbage, Logarithms of Numbers; Callet, Logarithms
of Sines, Cosines, etc. (4) Bagay, Tables Astronomiques et Hydrographiques.
The first and last of these are large works, calculated for
the most accurate operations of spherical trigonometry and astronomy.

roots in general, and logarithms. 171
ample, the following is found from any tables:
log 41713 = 4.6202714,
log 41714 = 4.6202818,
log 41715 = 4.6202922.
The difference of these successive logarithms and of almost
all others in the same page is .0000104. Therefore in this the
addition of 1 to the number gives an addition of .0000104
to the logarithm. It is a general rule that when one quantity
depends for its value upon another, as a logarithm does
upon its number, or an algebraical expression, such as x
2 +x
upon the letter or letters which it contains, if a very small
addition be made to the value of one of these letters, in consequence
of which the expression itself is increased or diminished;
generally speaking, the increment* of the expression
will be very nearly proportional to the increment of the letter
whose value is increased, and the more nearly so the smaller
is the increment of the letter. We proceed to illustrate this.
The product of two fractions, each of which is less than unity,
is itself less than either of its factors. Therefore the square,
cube, etc., of a fraction less than unity decrease, and the
smaller the fraction is the more rapid is that decrease, as the

is called its increment.
on the study of mathematics. 172
following examples will show:
Let x = .01, Let x = .00001,
x
2 = .0001, x2 = .0000000001,
x
3 = .000001, x3 = .000000000000001,
etc. etc.
Now quantities are compared, not by the actual difference
which exists between them, but by the number of times
which one contains the other, and, of two quantities which
are both very small, one may be very great as compared with
the other. In the second example x
2 and x
3 are both small
fractions when compared with unity; nevertheless, x
2
is very
great when compared with x
3
, being 100,000 times its magnitude.
This use of the words small and great sometimes
embarrasses the beginner; nevertheless, on consideration, it
will appear to be very similar to the sense in which they are
used in common life. We do not form our ideas of smallness
or greatness from the actual numbers which are contained
in a collection, but from the proportion which the numbers
bear to those which are usually found in similar collections.
Thus of 1000 men we should say, if they lived in one village,
that it was extremely large; if they formed a regiment, that
it was rather large; if an army, that it was utterly insignificant
in point of numbers. Hence, in such an expression as
Ah+Bh2+Ch3
, we may, if h is very small, reject Bh2+Ch3
,
as being very small compared with Ah. An error will thus
be committed, but a very small one only, and which becomes
roots in general, and logarithms. 173
smaller as h becomes smaller.
Let us take any algebraical expression, such as x
2 + x,
and suppose that x is increased by a very small quantity h.
The expression then becomes (x + h)
2 + (x + h), or
x
2 + x + (2x + 1)h + h
2
. But it was x
2 + x; therefore, in
consequence of x receiving the increment h, x
2 + x has
received the increment (2x+1)h+h
2
, for which (2x+1)h may
be written, since h is very small. This is proportional
to h, since, if h were doubled, (2x + 1)h would be doubled;
also, if the first were halved the second would be halved,
etc. In general, if y is a quantity which contains x, and if
x be changed into x + h, y is changed into a quantity of
the form y + Ah + Bh2 + Ch3 + etc.; that is, y receives an
increment of the form Ah + Bh2 + Ch3 + etc. If h be very
small, this may, without sensible error, be reduced to its
first term, viz., Ah, which is proportional to h. The general
proof of this proposition belongs to a higher department of
mathematics; nevertheless, the student may observe that it
holds good in all the instances which occur in elementary
treatises on arithmetic and algebra.
For example:
(x + h)
m = x
m + mxm-1h + m
m - 1

Here A = mxm-1

Again, log(1 + n

),
and let
xn0 = h or n

Making these substitutions, the equation becomes
log(x + h) = log x +

If h is very small, log(x + h) = log x +

We can now apply this to the logarithmic example with
which we commenced this subject. It appears that
log 41713 = 4.6202714,
log(41713 + 1) = 4.6202714 + .0000104,
log(41713 + 2) = 4.6202714 + .0000104 × 2.
From which, and the considerations above-mentioned,
log(41713 + h) = log 41713 + .0000104 × h,
which is extremely near the truth, even when h is a much
larger number, as the tables will show. Suppose, then, that
roots in general, and logarithms. 175
the logarithm of 41713.27 is required. Here h = .27. It
therefore only remains to calculate .0000104 × .27, and add
the result, or as much of it as is contained in the first seven
places of decimals, to the logarithm of 41713. This trouble
is saved in the tables in the following manner. The difference
of the successive logarithms is written down, with the
exception of the cyphers at the beginning, in the column
marked D or Diff., under which are registered the tenths of
that difference, or as much of them as is contained in the
first seven decimal places, increasing the seventh figure by 1
when the eighth is equal to or greater than 5, and omitting
the cyphers to save room. From this table of tenths the table
of hundredth parts may be made by striking off the last figure,
making the usual change in the last but one, when the
last is equal to or greater than 5, and placing an additional
cypher. The logarithm of 41713.27 is, therefore, obtained in
the following manner:
log 41713 = 4.6202714
.0000104 × .2 = .0000021
.0000104 × .07 = .0000007
log 41713.27 = 4.620274.
This, when the useless cyphers and parts of the operation are
omitted, is the process given in all the books of logarithms.
If the logarithm of a number containing more than seven significant
figures be sought, for example 219034.717, recourse
must be had to a table, in which the logarithms are carried to
more than seven places of decimals. The fact is, that in the
on the study of mathematics. 176
first seven places of decimals there is no difference between
log 219034.7 and log 219034.717. For an excellent treatise on
the practice of logarithms the reader may consult the preface
to Babbage’s Table of Logarithms.
*
*Copies of Babbage’s Table of Logarithms are now scarce, and the
reader may accordingly be referred to the prefaces of the treatises mentioned
on page 169. The article on “Logarithms, Use of” in the English
Cyclopedia, may also be consulted with profit.—Ed.
CHAPTER XII.
ON THE STUDY OF ALGEBRA.
In this chapter we shall give the student some advice as to
the manner in which he should prosecute his studies in algebra.
The remaining parts of this subject present a field infi-
nite in its extent and in the variety of the applications which
present themselves. By whatever name the remaining parts
of the subject may be called, even though the ideas on which
they are based may be geometrical, still the mechanical processes
are algebraical, and present continual applications of
the preceding rules and developments of the subjects already
treated. This is the case in Trigonometry, the application of
Algebra to Geometry, the Differential Calculus, or Fluxions,
etc.
I. The first thing to be attended to in reading any algebraical
treatise, is the gaining a perfect understanding of
the different processes there exhibited, and of their connexion
with one another. This cannot be attained by a mere
reading of the book, however great the attention which may
be given. It is impossible, in a mathematical work, to fill up
every process in the manner in which it must be filled up in
the mind of the student before he can be said to have completely
mastered it. Many results must be given, of which
the details are suppressed, such are the additions, multiplications,
extractions of the square root, etc., with which the
investigations abound. These must not be taken on trust
on the study of mathematics. 178
by the student, but must be worked by his own pen, which
must never be out of his hand while engaged in any algebraical
process. The method which we recommend is, to
write the whole of the symbolical part of each investigation,
filling up the parts to which we have alluded, adding only so
much verbal elucidation as is absolutely necessary to explain
the connexion of the different steps, which will generally be
much less than what is given in the book. This may appear
an alarming labor to one who has not tried it, nevertheless
we are convinced that it is by far the shortest method of
proceeding, since the deliberate consideration which the act
of writing forces us to give, will prevent the confusion and
difficulties which cannot fail to embarrass the beginner if he
attempt, by mere perusal only, to understand new reasoning
expressed in new language. If, while proceeding in this
manner, any difficulty should occur, it should be written at
full length, and it will often happen that the misconception
which occasioned the embarrassment will not stand the trial
to which it is thus brought. Should there be still any matter
of doubt which is not removed by attentive reconsideration,
the student should proceed, first making a note of the point
which he is unable to perceive. To this he should recur in his
subsequent progress, whenever he arrives at anything which
appears to have any affinity, however remote, to the diffi-
culty which stopped him, and thus he will frequently find
himself in a condition to decypher what formerly appeared
incomprehensible. In reasoning purely geometrical, there is
less necessity for committing to writing the whole detail of
on the study of algebra. 179
the arguments, since the symbolical language is more quickly
understood, and the subject is in a great measure independent
of the mechanism of operations; but, in the processes
of algebra, there is no point on which so much depends, or
on which it becomes an instructor more strongly to insist.
II. On arriving at any new rule or process, the student
should work a number of examples sufficient to prove to himself
that he understands and can apply the rule or process in
question. Here a difficulty will occur, since there are many of
these in the books, to which no examples are formally given.
Nevertheless, he may choose an example for himself, and
his previous knowledge will suggest some method of proving
whether his result is true or not. For example, the development
of (a + x)
7
3 will exercise him in the use of the binomial
theorem; when he has obtained the series which is equivalent
to (a + x)
7
3 , let him, in the same way, develop (a + x)
2
3 ; the
product of these, since 7
3 +
2
3 = 3, ought to be the same as
the development of (a + x)
3
, or as a
3 + 3a
2x + 3ax2 + x
3
.
He may also try whether the development of (a + x)
1
2 by the
binomial theorem, gives the same result as is obtained by
the extraction of the square root of a + x. Again, when any
development is obtained, it should be seen whether the development
possesses all the properties of the expression from
which it has been derived. For example, 1
1 - x
is proved to
be equivalent to the series
1 + x + x
2 + x
3 + etc., ad infinitum.
on the study of mathematics. 180
This, when multiplied by 1 - x, should give 1; when multiplied
by 1 - x
2
, should give 1 + x, because
1
1 - x
× (1 - x) = 1,
1
1 - x
× (1 - x
2
) = 1 + x, etc.
Again,
a
x = 1 + x log a +
x
2
(log a)
2
2
+
x
3
(log a)
3
2 · 3
+ . . . ad inf.,
a
y = 1 + y log a +
y
2
(log a)
2
2
+ etc.,
a
x+y = 1 + (x + y) log a +
(x + y)
2
(log a)
2
2
+ etc.
Now, since a
x × a
y = a
x+y
, the product of the two first
series should give the third. Many other instances of the
same sort will suggest themselves, and a careful attention to
them will confirm the demonstration of the several theorems,
which, to a beginner, is often doubtful, on account of the
generality of the reasoning.
III. Whenever a demonstration appears perplexed, on account
of the number and generality of the symbols, let some
particular case be chosen, and let the same demonstration
be applied. For example, if the binomial theorem should not
appear sufficiently plain, the same reasoning may be applied
to the expansion of (1+x)
2
3 , or any other case, which is there
applied to (1 + x)
m
n . Again, the general form of the product
(x + a), (x + b), (x + c), etc., . . . containing n factors, will
be made apparent by taking first two, then three, and four
on the study of algebra. 181
factors, before attempting to apply the reasoning which establishes
the form of the general product. The same applies
particularly to the theory of permutations and combinations,
and to the doctrine of probabilities, which is so materially
connected with it. In the theory of equations it will be advisable
at first, instead of taking the general equation of the
form
x
n + Axn-1 + Bxn-2 + · · · + Lx + M = 0,
to choose that of the third, or at most of the fourth degree,
or both, on which to demonstrate all the properties of expressions
of this description. But in all these cases, when
the particular instances have been treated, the general case
should not be neglected, since the power of reasoning upon
expressions such as the one just given, in which all the terms
cannot be written down, on account of their indeterminate
number, must be exercised, before the student can proceed
with any prospect of success to the higher branches of mathematics.
IV. When any previous theorem is referred to, the reference
should be made, and the student should satisfy himself
that he has not forgotten its demonstration. If he finds that
he has done so, he should not grudge the time necessary for
its recovery. By so doing, he will avoid the necessity of reading
over the subject again, and will obtain the additional
advantage of being able to give to each part of the subject
a time nearly proportional to its importance, whereas, by
reading a book over and over again until he is a master of it,
on the study of mathematics. 182
he will not collect the more prominent parts, and will waste
time upon unimportant details, from which even the best
books are not free. The necessity for this continual reference
is particularly felt in the Elements of Geometry, where allusion
is constantly made to preceding propositions, and where
many theorems are of no importance, considered as results,
and are merely established in order to serve as the basis of
future propositions.
V. The student should not lose any opportunity of exercising
himself in numerical calculation, and particularly
in the use of the logarithmic tables. His power of applying
mathematics to questions of practical utility is in direct
proportion to the facility which he possesses in computation.
Though it is in plane and spherical trigonometry that
the most direct numerical applications present themselves,
nevertheless the elementary parts of algebra abound with
useful practical questions. Such will be found resulting from
the binomial theorem, the theory of logarithms, and that of
continued fractions. The first requisite in this branch of the
subject, is a perfect acquaintance with the arithmetic of decimal
fractions; such a degree of acquaintance as can only be
gained by a knowledge of the principles as well as of the rules
which are deduced from them. From the imperfect manner
in which arithmetic is usually taught, the student ought in
most cases to recommence this study before proceeding to
the practice of logarithms.
VI. The greatest difficulty, in fact almost the only one of
any importance which algebra offers to the reason, is the use
on the study of algebra. 183
of the isolated negative sign in such expressions as -a, a
-x
,
and the symbols which we have called imaginary. It is a remarkable
fact, that the first elements of the mathematics,
sciences which demonstrate their results with more certainty
than any others, contain difficulties which have been the subjects
of discussion for centuries. In geometry, for example,
the theory of parallel lines has never yet been freed from the
difficulty which presented itself to Euclid, and obliged him to
assume, instead of proving, the 12th axiom of his first book.
Innumerable as have been the attempts to elude or surmount
this obstacle, no one has been more successful than another.
The elements of fluxions or the differential calculus, of mechanics,
of optics, and of all the other sciences, in the same
manner contain difficulties peculiar to themselves. These are
not such as would suggest themselves to the beginner, who
is usually embarrassed by the actual performance of the operations,
and no ways perplexed by any doubts as to the
foundations of the rules by which he is to work. It is the
characteristic of a young student in the mathematical sciences,
that he sees, or fancies that he sees, the truth of every
result which can be stated in a few words, or arrived at by
few and simple operations, while that which is long is always
considered by him as abstruse. Thus while he feels no embarrassment
as to the meaning of the equation +a × -a = -a
2
,
he considers the multiplication of a
m +a
n by b
m +b
n as one of
the difficulties of algebra. This arises, in our opinion, from
the manner in which his previous studies are usually conducted.
From his earliest infancy, he learns no fact from his
on the study of mathematics. 184
own observation, he deduces no truth by the exercise of his
own reason. Even the tables of arithmetic, which, with a
little thought and calculation, he might construct for himself,
are presented to him ready made, and it is considered
sufficient to commit them to memory. Thus a habit of examination
is not formed, and the student comes to the science
of algebra fully prepared to believe in the truth of any rule
which is set before him, without other authority than the
fact of finding it in the book to which he is recommended.
It is no wonder, then, that he considers the difficulty of a
process as proportional to that of remembering and applying
the rule which is given, without taking into consideration
the nature of the reasoning on which the rule was founded.
We are not advocates for stopping the progress of the student
by entering fully into all the arguments for and against
such questions, as the use of negative quantities, etc., which
he could not understand, and which are inconclusive on both
sides; but he might be made aware that a difficulty does exist,
the nature of which might be pointed out to him, and
he might then, by the consideration of a sufficient number
of examples, treated separately, acquire confidence in the results
to which the rules lead. Whatever may be thought of
this method, it must be better than an unsupported rule,
such as is given in many works on algebra.
It may perhaps be objected that this is induction, a
species of reasoning which is foreign to the usually received
notions of mathematics. To this it may be answered, that inductive
reasoning is of as frequent occurrence in the sciences
on the study of algebra. 185
as any other. It is certain that most great discoveries have
been made by means of it; and the mathematician knows
that one of his most powerful engines of demonstration is
that peculiar species of induction which proves many general
truths by demonstrating that, if the theorem be true in
one case, it is true for the succeeding one. But the beginner
is obliged to content himself with a less rigorous species of
proof, though equally conclusive, as far as moral certainty is
concerned. Unable to grasp the generalisations with which
the more advanced student is familiar, he must satisfy himself
of the truth of general theorems by observing a number of
particular simple instances which he is able to comprehend.
For example, we would ask any one who has gone over this
ground, whether he derived more certainty as to the truth of
the binomial theorem from the general demonstration (if indeed
he was suffered to see it so early in his career), or from
observation of its truth in the particular cases of the development
of (a + b)
2
, (a + b)
3
, etc., substantiated by ordinary
multiplication. We believe firmly, that to the mass of young
students, general demonstrations afford no conviction whatever;
and that the same may be said of almost every species
of mathematical reasoning, when it is entirely new. We have
before observed, that it is necessary to learn to reason; and
in no case is the assertion more completely verified than in
the study of algebra. It was probably the experience of the
inutility of general demonstrations to the very young student
that caused the abandonment of reasoning which prevailed
so much in English works on elementary mathematics. Rules
on the study of mathematics. 186
which the student could follow in practice supplied the place
of arguments which he could not, and no pains appear to
have been taken to adopt a middle course, by suiting the
nature of the proof to the student’s capacity. The objection
to this appears to have been the necessity which arose
for departing from the appearance of rigorous demonstration.
This was the cry of those who, not having seized the
spirit of the processes which they followed, placed the force
of the reasoning in the forms. To such the authority of great
names is a strong argument; we will therefore cite the words
of Laplace on this subject.
“Newton extended to fractional and negative powers the
analytical expression which he had found for whole and positive
ones. You see in this extension one of the great advantages
of algebraic language which expresses truths much
more general than those which were at first contemplated,
so that by making the extension of which it admits, there
arises a multitude of new truths out of formulæ which were
founded upon very limited suppositions. At first, people
were afraid to admit the general consequences with which
analytical formulæ furnished them; but a great number of
examples having verified them, we now, without fear, yield
ourselves to the guidance of analysis through all the consequences
to which it leads us, and the most happy discoveries
have sprung from the boldness. We must observe, however,
that precautions should be taken to avoid giving to formulæ
a greater extension than they really admit, and that it is
always well to demonstrate rigorously the results which are
on the study of algebra. 187
obtained.”
We have observed that beginners are not disposed to
quarrel with a rule which is easy in practice, and verified
by examples, on account of difficulties which occur in its
establishment. The early history of the sciences presents occasion
for the same remark. In the work of Diophantus, the
first Greek writer on algebra, we find a principle equivalent
to the equations +a × -b = -ab, and -a × -b = +ab, admitted
as an axiom, without proof or difficulty. In the Hindoo
works on algebra, and the Persian commentators upon
them, the same thing takes place. It appears, that struck
with the practical utility of the rule, and certain by induction
of its truth, they did not scruple to avail themselves of
it. A more cultivated age, possessed of many formulæ whose
developments presented striking examples of an universality
in algebraic language not contemplated by its framers, set
itself to inquire more closely into the first principles of the
science. Long and still unfinished discussions have been the
result, but the progress of nations has exhibited throughout
a strong resemblance to that of individuals.
VII. The student should make for himself a syllabus of
results only, unaccompanied by any demonstration. It is essential
to acquire a correct memory for algebraical formulæ,
which will save much time and labor in the higher departments
of the science. Such a syllabus will be a great assistance
in this respect, and care should be taken that it contain
only the most useful and most prominent formulæ. Whenever
that can be done, the student should have recourse to
on the study of mathematics. 188
the system of tabulation, of which he will have seen several
examples in this treatise. In this way he should write the various
forms which the roots of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0
assume, according to the signs of a, b, and c, etc. Both the
preceptor and the pupil, but especially the former, will derive
great advantage from the perusal of Lacroix, Essais sur
l’Enseignement en g´en´eral et sur celui des Math´ematiques en
particulier,
* Condillac, La Langue des Calculs, and the var*The
books mentioned in the present passage, while still very valuable,
are now not easily procurable and, besides, do not give a complete
idea of the subject in its modern extent. A recent work on the
Philosophy and Teaching of Mathematics is that of C. A. Laisant (La
Math´ematique. Philosophie-Enseignement, Paris, 1898, Georges Carr´e
et C. Naud, publishers.) Perhaps the most accessible and useful work
in English for the elements is David Eugene Smith’s new book The
Teaching of Elementary Mathematics. (New York: The Macmillan
Company, 1900). Mention might be made also of W. M. Gillespie’s
translation from Comte’s Cours de Philosophie Positive, under the title
of The Philosophy of Mathematics (New York: Harpers, 1851), and
of the Cours de M´ethodologie Math´ematique of F´elix Dauge (Deuxi`eme
edition, revue et augmentee. Gand, Ad. Hoste; Paris, Gauthier-Villars,
1896). The recent work of Freycinet on the Philosophy of the Sciences
(Paris, 1896, Gauthier-Villars) will be found valuable. One of the best
and most comprehensive of the modern works is that of Duhamel, Des
M´ethodes dans les Sciences de Raisonnement, (5 parts, Paris, GauthierVillars),
a work giving a comprehensive exposition of the foundations
of all the mathematical sciences. The chapters in D¨uhring’s Kritische
Geschichte der Prinzipien der Mechanik and his Neue Grundmittel on
the study of mathematics and mechanics is replete with original, but
hazardous, advice, and may be consulted as a counter-irritant to the
traditional professional views of the subject. The articles in the En-
on the study of algebra. 189
ious articles on the elements of algebra in the French Encyclopedia,
which are for the most part written by D’Alembert.
The reader will here find the first principles of algebra, developed
and elucidated in a masterly manner. A great collection
of examples will be found in most elementary works,
but particularly in Hirsch, Sammlung von Beispielen, etc.,
translated into English under the title of Self-Examinations
in Algebra, etc., London: Black, Young and Young, 1825.*
The student who desires to carry his algebraical studies farther
than usual, and to make them the stepping-stone to a
knowledge of the higher mathematics, should be acquainted
with the French language.† A knowledge of this, sufficient
to enable him to read the simple and easy style in which the
writers of that nation treat the first principles of every subject,
may be acquired in a short time. When that is done,
we recommend to the student the algebra of M. Bourdon,‡
glish Cyclopedia, by De Morgan himself, contain refreshing hints on this
subject. But the greatest inspiration is to be drawn from the works of
the masters themselves; for example, from such works as Laplace’s Introduction
to the Calculus of Probabilities, or from the historical and
philosophical reflexions that uniformly accompany the later works of
Lagrange. The same remark applies to the later mathematicians of
note.—Ed.
*Hirsch’s Collection, enlarged and modernised, can be obtained in
various recent German editions. The old English translations of the
original are not easily procured.—Ed.

text-books still retain their high standard.—Ed.
‡Bourdon’s Elements of Algebra is still used in France, having ap-
on the study of mathematics. 190
a work of eminent merit, though of some difficulty to the
English student, and requiring some previous habits of algebraical
reasoning.
VIII. The height to which algebraical studies should be
carried, must depend upon the purpose to which they are
peared in 1895 in its eighteenth edition, with notes by M. Prouhet
(Gauthier-Villars, Paris.) A more elementary French work of a modern
character is that of J. Collin (Second edition, 1888, Paris, GauthierVillars).
A larger and more complete treatise which begins with the
elements and extends to the higher branches of the subject is the Trait´e
d’Alg`ebre of H. Laurent, in four small volumes (Gauthier-Villars, Paris).
This work contains a large collection of examples. Another elementary
work is that of C. Bourlet, Lecons d’Alg`ebre El´ementaire, Paris, Colin,
1896. A standard and exhaustive work on higher algebra is the Cours
d’Alg`ebre Sup´erieure, of J. A. Serret, two large volumes (Fifth edition,
1885, Paris, Gauthier-Villars).
The number of American and English text-books of the intermediate
and higher type is very large. Todhunter’s Algebra and Theory of
Equations (London: Macmillan & Co.) were for a long time the standards
in England and this country, but have now (especially the firstmentioned)
been virtually superseded. An excellent recent text-book
for beginners, and one that skilfully introduces modern notions, is the
Elements of Algebra of W. W. Beman and D. E. Smith (Boston, 1900).
Fisher and Schwatt’s elementary text-books of algebra are also recommendable
from both a practical and theoretical point of view. Valuable
are C. Smith’s Treatise on Algebra (London: Macmillan), and Oliver,
Wait, and Jones’s Treatise on Algebra (Ithaca, N. Y., 1887), also Fine’s
Number System of Algebra (Boston: Leach). The best English work on
the theory of equations is Burnside and Panton’s (Longmans).
A very exhaustive presentation of the subject from the modern point
of view is the Algebra of Professor George Chrystal (Edinburgh: Adam
and Charles Black, publishers), in two large volumes of nearly six hun-
on the study of algebra. 191
to be applied. For the ordinary purposes of practical mathematics,
algebra is principally useful as the guide to trigonometry,
logarithms, and the solution of equations. Much and
profound study is not therefore requisite; the student should
pay great attention to all numerical processes and particdred
pages each. Recently Professor Chrystal has published a more
elementary work entitled Introduction to Algebra (same publishers).
A few German works may also be mentioned in this connexion, for
the benefit of readers acquainted with that language. Professor Hermann
Schubert has, in various forms, given systematic expositions
of the elementary principles of arithmetic, (e. g., see his Arithmetik
und Algebra, Sammlung G¨oschen, Leipsic,—an extremely cheap series
containing several other elementary mathematical works of high standard;
also, for a statement of Schubert’s views in English consult his
Mathematical Recreations, Chicago, 1898). Professor Schubert has recently
begun the editing of a new and larger series of mathematical
text-books called the Sammlung Schubert (Leipsic: G¨oschen), which
contains three works treating of algebra. In this connexion may be
mentioned also Matthiessen’s admirable Grundz¨uge der antiken und
modernen Algebra (Leipsic: Teubner) for literal equations. The following
are all excellent: (1) Otto Biermann’s Elemente der h¨oheren
Mathematik (Leipsic, 1895); (2) Petersen’s Theorie der algebraischen
Gleichungen (Copenhagen: H¨ost; also in French, Paris: GauthierVillars);
(3) Richard Baltzer’s Elemente der Mathematik (2 vols.,
Leipsic: Hirzel); (4) Gustav Holzm¨uller’s Methodisches Lehrbuch der
Elementarmathematik (3 parts, Leipsic: Teubner); (5) Werner Jos.

ularly to the methods of approximation which he will find
in all the books. His principal instrument is the table of
logarithms of which he should secure a knowledge both theoretical
and practical. The course which should be adopted
preparatory to proceeding to the higher branches of mathematics
is different. It is still of great importance that the
student should be well acquainted with numerical applications;
nevertheless, he may omit with advantage many details
relative to the obtaining of approximative numerical
results, particularly in the theory of equations of higher degrees
than the second. Instead of occupying himself upon
these, he should proceed to the application of algebra to geometry,
and afterwards to the differential calculus. When
a competent knowledge of these has been obtained, he may
then revert to the subjects which he has neglected, giving
them more or less attention according to his own opinion of
the use which he is likely to have for them. This applies
particularly to the theory of equations, which abounds with
processes of which very few students will afterwards find the
necessity.

which arise in the study of Geometry and Trigonometry.

CHAPTER XIII.
ON THE DEFINITIONS OF GEOMETRY.
In this treatise on the difficulties of Geometry and Trigonometry,
we propose, as in the former part of the work, to touch
on those points only which, from novelty in their principle,
are found to present difficulties to the student, and which are
frequently not sufficiently dwelt upon in elementary works.
Perhaps it may be asserted, that there are no difficulties in
geometry which are likely to place a serious obstacle in the
way of an intelligent beginner, except the temporary embarrassment
which always attends the commencement of a
new study; that, for example, there is nothing in the elements
of pure geometry comparable, in point of complexity,
to the theory of the negative sign, of fractional indices, or
of the decomposition of an expression of the second degree
into factors. This may be true; and were it only necessary
to study the elements of this science for themselves, without
reference to their application, by means of algebra, to higher
branches of knowledge, we should not have thought it necessary
to call the attention of our readers to the points which
we shall proceed to place before them. But while there is
a higher study in which elementary ideas, simple enough in
their first form, are so generalised as to become difficult, it
will be an assistance to the beginner who intends to proceed
through a wider course of pure mathematics than forms part
of common education, if his attention is early directed, in a
on the study of mathematics. 194
manner which he can comprehend, to future extensions of
what is before him.
The reason why geometry is not so difficult as algebra,
is to be found in the less general nature of the symbols employed.
In algebra a general proposition respecting numbers
is to be proved. Letters are taken which may represent any
of the numbers in question, and the course of the demonstration,
far from making any use of a particular case, does
not even allow that any reasoning, however general in its
nature, is conclusive, unless the symbols are as general as
the arguments. We do not say that it would be contrary
to good logic to form general conclusions from reasoning on
one particular case, when it is evident that the same considerations
might be applied to any other, but only that very
great caution, more than a beginner can see the value of,
would be requisite in deducing the conclusion. There occurs
also a mixture of general and particular propositions, and
the latter are liable to be mistaken for the former. In geometry
on the contrary, at least in the elementary parts, any
proposition may be safely demonstrated by reasonings on
any one particular example. For though in proving a property
of a triangle many truths regarding that triangle may
be asserted as having been proved before, none are brought
forward which are not general, that is, true for all instances
of the same kind. It also affords some facility that the results
of elementary geometry are in many cases sufficiently
evident of themselves to the eye; for instance, that two sides
of a triangle are greater than the third, whereas in algebra
on the definitions of geometry. 195
many rudimentary propositions derive no evidence from the
senses; for example, that a
3 - b
3
is always divisible without
remainder by a - b.
The definitions of the simple terms point, line, and surface
have given rise to much discussion. But the difficulties
which attend them are not of a nature to embarrass the beginner,
provided he will rest content with the notions which
he has already derived from observation. No explanation can
make these terms more intelligible. To them may be added
the words straight line, which cannot be mistaken for one
moment, unless it be by means of the attempt to explain
them by saying that a straight line is “that which lies evenly
between its extreme points.”
The line and surface are distinct species of magnitude,
as much so as the yard and the acre. The first is no part of
the second, that is, no number of lines can make a surface.
When therefore a surface is divided into two parts by a line,
the dividing line is not to be considered as forming a part
of either. That the idea of the line or boundary necessarily
enters into the notion of the division is very true; but if we
conceive the line abstracted, and thus get rid of the idea of
division, neither surface is increased or diminished, which
is what we mean when we say that the line is not a part
of the surface. The same considerations apply to a point,
considered as the boundary of the divisions of a line.
The beginner may perhaps imagine that a line is made
up of points, that is, that every line is the sum of a number
of points, a surface the sum of a number of lines, and so
on the study of mathematics. 196
on. This arises from the fact, that the things which we draw
on paper as the representatives of lines and points, have in
reality three dimensions, two of which, length and breadth,
are perfectly visible. Thus the point, such as we are obliged
to represent it, in order to make its position visible, is in
reality a part of our line, and our points, if sufficiently multiplied
in number and placed side by side, would compose a
line of any length whatever. But taking the mathematical
definition of a point, which denies it all magnitude, either in
length, breadth, or thickness, and of a line, which is asserted
to possess length only without breadth or thickness, it is easy
to show that a point is no part of a line, by making it appear
that the shortest line can be cut in as many points as the
longest, which may be done in the following manner. Let
AB be any straight line, from the ends of which, A and B,
draw two lines, AF and CB, parallel to one another. Consider
AF as produced without limit, and in CB take any
point C, from which draw lines CE, CF, etc., to different
points in AF. It is evident that for each point E in AF
there is a distinct point in AB, viz., the intersection of CE
with AB;—for, were it possible that two points, E and F
in AF, could be thus connected with the same point of AB,
it is evident that two straight lines would enclose a space,
viz., the lines CE and CF, which both pass through C, and
would, were our supposition correct, also pass through the
same point in AB. There can then be taken as many points
in the finite or unbounded line AB as in the indefinitely extended
line AF.
on the definitions of geometry. 197
Fig. 1.
The next definition which we shall consider is that of a
plane surface. The word plane or flat is as hard to define,
without reference to any thing but the idea we have of it, as
it is easy to understand. Nevertheless the practical method
of ascertaining whether or no a surface is plane, will furnish
a definition, not such, indeed, as to render the nature
of a plane surface more evident, but which will serve, in a
mathematical point of view, as a basis on which to rest the
propositions of solid geometry. If the edge of a ruler, known
to be perfectly straight, coincides with a surface throughout
its whole length, in whatever direction it may be placed upon
that surface, we conclude that the surface is plane. Hence
the definition of a plane surface is that in which, any two
points being taken, the straight line joining these points lies
wholly upon the surface.
Two straight lines have a relation to one another independent
altogether of their length. This we commonly express
(for among the most common ideas are found the germ of ev-
on the study of mathematics. 198
ery geometrical theory) by saying that they are in the same
or different directions. By the direction of the needle we ascertain
the direction in which to proceed at sea, and by the
direction in which the hands of a clock are placed we tell the
hour. It remains to reduce this common notion to a more
precise form.
Suppose a straight line OA to be given in magnitude and
position, and to remain fixed while another line OB, at first
coincident with OA, is made to move round OA, so as continually
to vary its direction with respect to OA. The process
of opening a pair of compasses will furnish an illustration of
this, but the two lines need not be equal to one another. In
this case the opening made by the two will continually increase,
and this opening is a species of magnitude, since one
opening may be compared with another, so as to ascertain
which of the two is the greater. Thus if the figure CP D be
removed from its place, without any other change, so that
the point P may fall on O, and the line P C may lie upon
and become a part of OA, or OA of P C, according to which
is the longer of the two, then if the opening CP D is the
same as the opening AOB, P D will lie upon OB at the
same time as P C lies upon OA. But if P D does not then lie
upon OB, but falls between OB and OA, the opening CP D
is less than the opening AOB, and if P D does not fall between
OA and OB, or on OB, the opening CP D is greater
than the opening BOA. To this species of magnitude, the
opening of two lines, the name of angle is given, that is BO is
said to make an angle with OA. The difficulty here arises
on the definitions of geometry. 199
Fig. 2.
from this magnitude being one, the measure of which has seldom
fallen under observation of those who begin geometry.
Every one has measured one line by means of another, and
has thus made a number the representative of a length; but
few, at this period of their studies, have been accustomed
to the consideration, that one opening may be contained a
certain number of times in another, or may be a certain fraction
of another. Nevertheless we may find measures of this
new species of magnitude either by means of time, length,
or number.
One magnitude is said to be a measure of another, when,
if the first be doubled, trebled, halved, etc., the second is
doubled, trebled, or halved, etc.; that is, when any fraction
or multiple of the first corresponds to the same fraction or
multiple of the second in the same manner as the first does
to the second. The two quantities need not be of the same
kind: thus, in the barometer the height of the mercury (a
length) measures the pressure of the atmosphere (a weight);
for if the barometer which yesterday stood at 28 inches, to-
on the study of mathematics. 200
day stands at 29 inches, in which case the height of yesterday
is increased by its 28th part, we know that the atmospheric
pressure of yesterday is increased by its 28th part to-day.
Again, in a watch, the number of hours elapsed since twelve
o clock is measured by the angle which a hand makes with the
position it occupied at twelve o’clock. In the spring balances
a weight is measured by an angle, and many other similar
instances might be given.
This being premised, suppose a line which moves round
another as just described, to move uniformly, that is, to describe
equal openings or angles in equal times. Suppose the
line OA to move completely round, so as to reassume its
first position in twenty-four hours. Then in twelve hours
the moving line will be in the position OB, in six hours it
will be in OC, and in eighteen hours in OD. The line OC
is that which makes equal angles with OA and OB, and is
said to be at right angles, or perpendicular to OA and OB.
Again, OA and OB which are in the same right line, but
on opposite sides of the point O, evidently make an opening
or angle which is equal to the sum of the angles AOC
and COB, or equal to two right angles. A line may also be
said to make with itself an opening equal to four right angles,
since after revolving through four right angles, the moving
line reassumes its original position. We may even carry this
notion farther: for if the moving line be in the position OE
when P hours have elapsed, it will recover that position after
every twenty-four hours, that is, for every additional four
right angles described; so that the angle AOE is equally well
on the definitions of geometry. 201
Fig. 3.
represented by any of the following angles:
4 right angles + AOE,
8 right angles + AOE,
12 right angles + AOE, etc.
These formulæ which suppose an opening greater than
any apparent opening, and which take in and represent the
fact that the moving line has attained its position for the
second, third, fourth, etc., time, since the commencement of
the motion, are not of any use in elementary geometry; but
as they play an important part in the application of algebra
on the study of mathematics. 202
to the theory of angles, we have thought it right to mention
them here.
It is plain also that we may conceive the line OE to
make two openings or angles with the original position OA:
(1) that through which it has moved to recede from OA;
(2) that through which it must move to reach OA again.
The first (in the position in which we have placed OA) is
what is called in geometry the angle AOE; the second is
more simply described as composed of the openings or angles
EOC, COB, BOD, DOA, and is not used except in the
application of algebra above mentioned.* Of the two angles
just alluded to, one must be less than two right angles, and
the second greater; the first is the one usually referred to.
It is plain that the angle or opening made by two lines
does not depend upon their length but upon their position;
if either be shortened or lengthened, the angle still remains
the same; and if while the angle increases or decreases one
of the straight lines containing it is diminished, the angle
so contained may have a definite and given magnitude at
the moment when the straight line disappears altogether
and becomes nothing. For example, take two points of any
curve AB, and join A and B by a straight line. Let the
point B move towards A; it is evident that the angle made
by the moving line with AB increases continually, while as
much of one of the lines containing it as is intercepted by the
*But use is made of it in some modern text-books of elementary
geometry.—Ed.
on the definitions of geometry. 203
Fig. 4.
curve, diminishes without limit. When this intercepted part
disappears entirely, the line in which it would have lain had
it had any length, has reached the line AG, which is called
the tangent of the curve.
In elementary geometry two equal angles lying on different
sides of a line, such as AOE, AOH (Fig. 3), would be
considered as the same. In the application of algebra, they
would be considered as having different signs, for reasons
stated at length in pages 111 et seq., of the first part of this
Treatise. It is also common in the latter branch of the science
to measure angles in one direction only; for example,
in Figure 3 the angles made by OE, OF, OG, and OH, if
measured upwards from OA, would be the openings through
which a line must move in the same direction from OA, to
attain those positions; and the second, third, and fourth angles
would be greater than one, two, and three right angles
respectively.
We proceed to the method of reasoning in geometry, or
on the study of mathematics. 204
rather to the method of reasoning in general, since there is,
or ought to be, no essential difference between the manner
of deducing results from first principles, in any science.
CHAPTER XIV.
ON GEOMETRICAL REASONING.
It is evident that all reasoning, of what form soever, can
be reduced at last to a number of simple propositions or
assertions; each of which, if it be not self-evident, depends
upon those which have preceded it. Every assertion can be
divided into three distinct parts. Thus the phrase, “all right
angles are equal,” consists of: (1) the subject spoken of, viz.,
right angles, which is here spoken of universally, since every
right angle is a part of the subject; (2) the copula, or manner
in which the two are joined together, which is generally the
verb is, or is equal to, and can always be reduced to one
or the other: in this case the copula is affirmative; (3) the
predicate, or thing asserted of the subject, viz., equal angles.
The phrase, thus divided, stands as written below under 1,
and is called a universal affirmative. The second is called
a particular affirmative proposition; the third a universal
negative; the fourth a particular negative:
1. All right angles are equal (magnitudes).
2. Some triangles are equilateral (figures).
3. No circle is convex to its diameter.
4. Some triangles are not equilateral (figures).
Many assertions appear in a form which, at first sight,
cannot be reduced to one of the preceding; the following are
instances of the change which it is necessary to make in them:
1. Parallel lines never meet, or parallel lines are lines
on the study of mathematics. 206
which never meet.
2. The angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are
equal, or an isosceles triangle is a triangle having the angles
at the base equal.
The different species of assertions, and the arguments
which are compounded of them, may be distinctly conceived
by referring them all to one species of subject and predicate.
Since every assertion, generally speaking, includes a number
of individual cases in its subject, let the points of a circle be
the subject and those of a triangle the predicate. These figures
being drawn, the four species of assertions just alluded
to are as follows:
1. Every point of the circle is a point of the triangle, or
the circle is contained in the triangle.
2. Some points of the circle are points of the triangle, or
part of the circle is contained in the triangle.
3. No point of the circle is a point of the triangle, or the
circle is entirely without the triangle.
4. Some points of the circle are not points of the triangle,
or part of the circle is outside the triangle.
On these we observe that the second follows from the
first, as also the fourth from the third, since that which is
true of all is true of some or any; while the first and third do
not follow from the second and fourth, necessarily, since that
which is true of some only need not be true of all. Again,
the second and fourth are not necessarily inconsistent with
each other for the same reason. Also two of these assertions
must be true and the others untrue. The first and the
on geometrical reasoning. 207
third are called contraries, while the first and fourth, and
the second and third are contradictory. The converse of a
proposition is made by changing the predicate into the subject,
and the subject into the predicate. No mistake is more
common than confounding together a proposition and its
converse, the tendency to which is rather increased in those
who begin geometry, by the number of propositions which
they find, the converses of which are true. Thus all the definitions
are necessarily conversely true, since the identity of
the subject and predicate is not merely asserted, but the
subject is declared to be a name given to all those magnitudes
which have the properties laid down in the predicate,
and to no others. Thus a square is a four-sided figure having
equal sides and one right angle, that is, let every four-sided
figure having, etc., be called a square, and let no other figure
be called by that name, whence the truth of the converse is
evident. Also many of the facts proved in geometry are conversely
true. Thus all equilateral triangles are equiangular,
from which it is proved that all equiangular triangles are
equilateral. Of the first species of assertion, the universal
affirmative, the converse is not necessarily true. Thus “every
point in figure A is a point of B,” does not imply that
“every point of B is a point of A,” although this may be the
case, and is, if the two figures coincide entirely. The second
species, the particular affirmative, is conversely true, since
if some points of A are points of B, some points of B are
also points of A. The first species of assertion is conversely
true, if the converse be made to take the form of the sec-
on the study of mathematics. 208
ond species: thus from “all right angles are equal,” it may
be inferred that “some equal magnitudes are right angles.”
The third species, the universal negative, is conversely true,
since if “no point of B is a point of A,” it may be inferred
that “no point of A is a point of B.” The fourth species, the
particular negative, is not necessarily conversely true. From
“some points of A are not points of B,” or A is not entirely
contained within B, we can infer nothing as to whether B is
or is not entirely contained in A. It is plain that the converse
of a proposition is not necessarily true, if it says more
either of the subject or predicate than was said before. Now
“every equilateral triangle is equiangular,” does not speak of
all equiangular triangles, but asserts that among all possible
equiangular triangles are to be found all the equilateral ones.
There may then, for anything to the contrary to be discovered
in our assertion, be classes of equiangular triangles not
included under this assertion, of which we can therefore say
nothing. But in saying “no right angles are unequal,” that
which we exclude, we exclude from all unequal angles, and
therefore “no unequal angles are right angles” is not more
general than the first.
The various assertions brought forward in a geometrical
demonstration must be derived in one of the following ways:
I. From definition. This is merely substituting, instead
of a description, the name which it has been agreed to give
to whatever bears that description. No definition ought to
be introduced until it is certain that the thing defined is
really possible. Thus though parallel lines are defined to be
on geometrical reasoning. 209
“lines which are in the same plane, and which being ever
so far produced never meet,” the mere agreement to call
such lines, should they exist, by the name of parallels, is no
sufficient ground to assume that they do exist. The definition
is therefore inadmissible until it is really shown that there
are such things as lines which being in the same plane never
meet. Again, before applying the name, care must be taken
that all the circumstances connected with the definition have
been attended to. Thus, though in plane geometry, where
all lines are in one plane, it is sufficient that two lines would
never meet though ever so far produced, to call them parallel,
yet in solid geometry the first circumstance must be attended
to, and it must be shown that lines are in the same plane
before the name can be applied. Some of the axioms come
so near to definitions in their nature, that their place may
be considered as doubtful. Such are, “the whole is greater
than its part,” and “magnitudes which entirely coincide are
equal to one another.”
II. From hypothesis. In the statement of every proposition,
certain connexions are supposed to exist from which it
is asserted that certain consequences will follow. Thus “in
an isosceles triangle the angles at the base are equal,” or, “if
a triangle be isosceles the angles at the base will be equal.”
Here the hypothesis or supposition is that the triangle has
two equal sides, the consequence asserted is that the angles
at the base or third side will be equal. The consequence
being only asserted to be true when the angle is isosceles,
such a triangle is supposed to be taken as the basis of the
on the study of mathematics. 210
reasonings, and the condition that its two sides are equal,
when introduced in the proof, is said to be introduced by
hypothesis.
In order to establish the result it may be necessary to
draw other lines, etc., which are not mentioned in the first
hypothesis. These, when introduced, form what is called the
construction.
There is another species of hypothesis much in use, principally
when it is required to deduce the converse of a theorem
from the theorem itself. Instead of proving the consequence
directly, the contradictory of the consequence is assumed to
hold good, and if from this new hypothesis, supposed to exist
together with the old one, any evidently absurd result can
be derived, such as that the whole is greater than its part,
this shows that the two hypotheses are not consistent, and
that if the first be true, the second cannot be so. But if the
second be not true, its contradictory is true, which is what
was required to be proved.
III. From the evidence of the assertions themselves. The
propositions thus introduced without proof are only such as
are in their nature too simple to admit of it. They are called
axioms. But it is necessary to observe, that the claim of
an assertion to be called an axiom does not depend only on
its being self-evident. Were this the case many propositions
which are always proved might be assumed; for example, that
two sides of a triangle are greater than the third, or that a
straight line is the shortest distance between two points. In
addition to being self-evident, it must be incapable of proof
on geometrical reasoning. 211
by any other means, and it is one of the objects of geometry
to reduce the demonstrations to the least possible number
of axioms. There are only two axioms which are distinctly
geometrical in their nature, viz., “two straight lines cannot
enclose a space,” and “through each point outside a line, not
more than one parallel to that line can be drawn.” All the
rest of the propositions commonly given as axioms are either
arithmetical in their nature; such as “the whole is greater
than its part,” “the doubles of equals are equals,” etc.; or
mere definitions, such as “magnitudes which entirely coincide
are equal;” or theorems admitting of proof, such as “all right
angles are equal.” There is however one more species of selfevident
proposition, the postulate or self-evident problem,
such as the possibility of drawing a right line, etc.
IV. From proof already given. What has been proved
once may be always taken for granted afterwards. It is evident
that this is merely for the sake of brevity, since it would
be possible to begin from the axioms and proceed direct to
the proof of any one proposition, however far removed from
them; and this is an exercise which we recommend to the student.
Thus much for the legitimate use of any single assertion
or proposition. We proceed to the manner of deducing
a third proposition from two others.
It is evident that no assertion can be the direct and necessary
consequence of two others, unless those two contain
something in common, or which is spoken of in both. In
many, nay most, cases of ordinary conversation and writing,
we leave out one of the assertions, which is, usually speak-
on the study of mathematics. 212
ing, very evident, and make the other assertion followed by
the consequence of both. Thus, “Geometry is useful, and
therefore ought to be studied,” contains not only what is expressed,
but also the following, “That which is useful ought
to be studied;” for were this not admitted, the former assertion
would not be necessarily true. This may be written
thus:
Every thing useful is what ought to be studied.
Geometry is useful, therefore geometry is what
ought to be studied.
This, in its present state, is called a syllogism, and may
be compared with the following, from which it only differs in
the things spoken of, and not in the manner in which they
are spoken of.
Every point of the circle is a point of the triangle.
The point B is a point of the circle.
Therefore the point B is a point of the triangle.
Here a connexion is established between the point B and
the points of the triangle (viz., that the first is one of the
second) by comparing them with the points of the circle;
that which is asserted of every point of the circle in the first
can be asserted of the point B, because from the second B is
one of these points. Again, in the former argument, whatever
on geometrical reasoning. 213
is asserted of every thing useful is true of geometry, because
geometry is useful.
The common term of the two propositions is called the
middle term, while the predicate and subject of the conclusion
are called the major and minor terms, respectively. The
two first assertions are called the major and minor premisses,
and the last the conclusion. Suppose now the two premisses
and conclusion of the syllogism just quoted to be varied in
every possible way from affirmative to negative, from universal
to particular, and vice versa, where the number of
changes will be 4 × 4 × 4, or 64 (called moods); since each
proposition may receive four different forms, and each form
of one may be compounded with any of the other two. And
these may be still further varied, if instead of the middle
term being the subject of the first, and the predicate of the
second, this order be reversed, or if the middle term be the
subject of both, or the predicate of both, which will give four
different figures, as they are called, to each of the sixty-four
moods above mentioned. But of these very few are correct
deductions, and without entering into every case we will state
some general rules, being the methods which common reason
would take to ascertain the truth or falsehood of any one of
them, collected and generalised.*

I. The middle term must be the same in both premisses,
by what has just been observed; since in the comparison of
two things with one and the same third thing, in order to
ascertain their connexion or discrepancy, consists the whole
of reasoning. Thus, the deduction without further process of
the equation a

from the proposition, which proves
that the sum of the squares described on the sides of a rightangled
triangle is equal to the square on its hypothenuse,
a, b, and c being the number of linear units in the sides and
the hypothenuse, is incorrect, since syllogistically stated the
argument would stand thus:

Here the term square in the major premiss has its geometrical,
and in the minor its algebraical sense, being in the
first a geometrical figure, and in the second an arithmetical
operation. The term of comparison is not therefore the same
in both, and the conclusion does not therefore follow from
the premisses.
The same error is committed if all that can be contained
under the middle term be not spoken of either in the major
or minor premiss. For if each premiss mentions only a
part of the middle term, these parts may be different, and
the term of comparison really different in the two, though
passing under the same name in both. Thus,
All the triangle is in the circle,
All the square is in the circle,
proves nothing, since the square may, consistently with these
conditions, be either wholly, partly, or not at all contained in
the triangle. In fact, as we have before shown, each of these
assertions speaks of a part of the circle only. The following
is of the same kind:
on the study of mathematics. 216
Some of the triangle is in the circle.
Some of the circle is not in the square, etc.
II. If both premisses are negative, no conclusion can be
drawn. For it can evidently be no proof either of agreement
or disagreement that two things both disagree with a third.
Thus the following is inconclusive:
None of the circle is in the triangle.
None of the square is in the circle.
III. If both premisses are particular, no conclusion can be
drawn, as will appear from every instance that can be taken,
thus:
Some of the circle is in the triangle.
Some of the square is not in the circle,
proves nothing.
IV. In forming a conclusion, where a conclusion can be
formed, nothing must be asserted more generally in the conclusion
than in the premisses. Thus, if from the following,
All the triangle is in the circle,
All the circle is in the square,
we would draw a conclusion in which the square should be
the subject, since the whole square is not mentioned in the
minor premiss, but only part of it, the conclusion must be,
Part of the square is in the triangle.
on geometrical reasoning. 217
V. If either of the premisses be negative, the conclusion
must be negative. For as both premisses cannot be negative,
there is asserted in one premiss an agreement between
the term of the conclusion and the middle term, and in the
other premiss a disagreement between the other term of the
conclusion, and the same middle term. From these nothing
can be inferred but a disagreement or negative conclusion.
Thus, from
None of the circle is in the triangle,
All the circle is in the square,
can only be inferred,
Some of the square is not in the triangle.
VI. If either premiss be particular, the conclusion must
be particular. For example, from
None of the circle is in the triangle,
Some of the circle is in the square,
we deduce,
Some of the square is not in the triangle.
If the student now applies these rules, he will find that of
the sixty-four moods eleven only are admissible in any case;
and in applying these eleven moods to the different figures he
will also find that some of them are not admissible in every
figure, and some not necessary, on account of the conclusion,
on the study of mathematics. 218
though true, not being as general as from the premisses it
might be. This he may do either by reasoning or by actual inspection
of the figures, drawn and arranged according to the
premisses. The admissible moods are nineteen in number,
and are as follows, where A at the beginning of a proposition
signifies that it is a universal affirmative, E a universal
negative, I a particular affirmative, O a particular negative.

on geometrical reasoning. 221
We may observe that it is sometimes possible to condense
two or more syllogisms into one argument, thus:
Every A is B (1),
Every B is C (2),
Every C is D (3),
Every D is E (4),
Therefore Every A is E (5),
is equivalent to three distinct syllogisms of the form Fig. 1.;
these syllogisms at length being (1), (2), a; a, (3), b;
b, (4), (5).
The student, when he has well considered each of these,
and satisfied himself, first by the rules, and afterwards by
inspection, that each of them is legitimate; and also that
all other moods, not contained in the above, are not allowable,
or at least do not give the most general conclusion,
should form for himself examples of each case, for instance
of Fig. III, 3:
The axioms constitute part of the basis of geometry.
Some of the axioms are grounded on the evidence
of the senses.
? Some evidence derived from the senses is part
of the basis of geometry.
on the study of mathematics. 222
He should also exercise himself in the first principles of
reasoning by reducing arguments as found in books to the
syllogistic form. Any controversial or argumentative work
will furnish him with a sufficient number of instances.
Inductive reasoning is that in which a universal proposition
is proved by proving separately every one of its particular
cases. As where, for example, a figure, ABCD, is proved
to be a rectangle by proving each of its angles separately to
be a right angle, or proving all the premisses of the following,
from which the conclusion follows necessarily:
The angles at A, B, C, and D are all the angles
of the figure ABCD.
A is a right angle,
B is a right angle,
C is a right angle,
D is a right angle,
Therefore all the angles of the figure ABCD are
right angles.
This may be considered as one syllogism of which the
minor premiss is,
A, B, C, and D are right angles,
where each part is to be separately proved.
Reasoning `a fortiori, is that contained in Fig. I. 1. in
a different form, thus: A is greater than B, B is greater
on geometrical reasoning. 223
than C; `a fortiori A is greater than C; which may be also
stated as follows:
The whole of B is contained in A,
The whole of C is contained in B,
Therefore C is contained in A.
The premisses of the second do not necessarily imply as
much as those of the first; the complete reduction we leave
to the student.
The elements of geometry present a collection of such
reasonings as we have just described, though in a more condensed
form. It is true that, for the convenience of the
learner, it is broken up into distinct propositions, as a journey
is divided into stages; but nevertheless, from the very
commencement, there is nothing which is not of the nature
just described. We present the following as a specimen of a
geometrical proposition reduced nearly to a syllogistic form.
To avoid multiplying petty syllogisms, we have omitted some
few which the student can easily supply.
Hypothesis.—ABC is a right-angled triangle the right angle
being at A.
Consequence.—The squares on AB and AC are together
equal to the square on BC.
Construction: Upon BC and BA describe squares, produce
DB to meet EF, produced, if necessary, in G, and
through A draw HAK parallel to BD.

Such is an outline of the process, every step of which
the student must pass through before he has understood the
demonstration. Many of these steps are not contained in the
book, because the most ordinary intelligence is sufficient to
suggest them, but the least is as necessary to the process
as the greatest. Instead of writing the propositions at this
length, the student is recommended to adopt the plan which
we now lay before him.
The explanation of this is as follows: the whole proposition
is divided into distinct assertions, which are placed in
separate consecutive paragraphs, which paragraphs are numbered
in the first column on the left; in the second column
on the left we state the reasons for each paragraph, either by
referring to the preceding paragraphs from which they follow,
or the preceding propositions in which they have been
proved. In the latter case a letter is placed in the column, and
at the end, the enunciation of the proposition there used is
written opposite to the letter. By this method, the proposition
is much shortened, its more prominent parts are brought
immediately under notice, and the beginner, if he recollect
the preceding propositions perfectly well, is not troubled by
the repetition of prolix enunciations, while in the contrary

case he has them at hand for reference.
In all that has been said, we have taken instances only of
direct reasoning, that is, where the required result is immediately
obtained without any reference to what might have
happened if the result to be proved had not been true. But
there are many propositions in which the only possible result
is one of two things which cannot be true at the same time,
and it is more easy to show that one is not the truth, than
that the other is. This is called indirect reasoning; not that
it is less satisfactory than the first species, but because, as
its name imports, the method does not appear so direct and
natural. There are two propositions of which it is required to
show that whenever the first is true the second is true; that
is, the first being the hypothesis the second is a necessary
conclusion from it, whence the hypothesis in question, and
anything contradictory to, or inconsistent with, the conclu-
on geometrical reasoning. 229
sion cannot exist together. In indirect reasoning, we suppose
that, the original hypothesis existing and being true, something
inconsistent with or contradictory to the conclusion
is true also. If from combining the consequences of these
two suppositions, something evidently erroneous or absurd
is deduced, it is plain that there is something wrong in the
assumptions. Now care is taken that the only doubtful point
shall be the one just alluded to, namely, the supposition that
one proposition and the contradictory of the other are true
together. This then is incorrect, that is, the first proposition
cannot exist with anything contradictory to the second,
or the second must exist wherever the first exists, since if
any proposition be not true its contradictory must be true,
and vice versa. This is rather embarrassing to the beginner,
who finds that he is required to admit, for argument’s
sake, a proposition which the argument itself goes to destroy.
But the difficulty would be materially lessened, if instead of
assuming the contradictory of the second proposition positively,
it were hypothetically stated, and the consequences
of it asserted with the verb “would be,” instead of “is.” For
example: suppose it to be known that if A is B, then C must
be D, and it is required to show indirectly that when C is
not D, A is not B. This put into the form in which such
a proposition would appear in most elementary works, is as
follows.
It being granted that if A is B, C is D, it is required
to show that when C is not D, A is not B. If possible, let
C be not D, and let A be B. Then by what is granted, since
on the study of mathematics. 230
A is B, C is D; but by hypothesis C is not D, therefore both
C is D and is not D, which is absurd; that is, it is absurd to
suppose that C is not D and A is B, consequently when C is
not D, A is not B. The following, which is exactly the same
thing, is plainer in its language. Let C be not D. Then if
A were B, C would be D by the proposition granted. But by
hypothesis C is not D, etc. This sort of indirect reasoning
frequently goes by the name of reductio ad absurdum.
In all that has gone before we may perceive that
the validity of an argument depends upon two distinct
considerations,—(1) the truth of the relations assumed, or
represented to have been proved before; (2) the manner
in which these facts are combined so as to produce new
relations; in which last the reasoning properly consists. If
either of these be incorrect in any single point, the result
is certainly false; if both be incorrect, or if one or both be
incorrect in more points than one, the result, though not
at all to be depended on, is not certainly false, since it
may happen and has happened, that of two false reasonings
or facts, or the two combined, one has reversed the effect
of the other and the whole result has been true; but this
could only have been ascertained after the correction of the
erroneous fact or reasoning. The same thing holds good in
every species of reasoning, and it must be observed, that
however different geometrical argument may be in form from
that which we employ daily, it is not different in reality. We
are accustomed to talk of mathematical reasoning as above
all other, in point of accuracy and soundness. This, if by the
on geometrical reasoning. 231
term reasoning we mean the comparing together of different
ideas and producing other ideas from the comparison, is not
correct, for in this view mathematical reasonings and all
other reasonings correspond exactly. For the real difference
between mathematics and other studies in this respect we
refer the student to the first chapter of this treatise.
In what then, may it be asked, does the real advantage
of mathematical study consist? We repeat again, in the actual
certainty which we possess of the truth of the facts on
which the whole is based, and the possibility of verifying
every result by actual measurement, and not in any superiority
which the method of reasoning possesses, since there
is but one method of reasoning. To pursue the illustration
with which we opened this work (page the first), suppose this
point to be raised, was the slaughter of Cæsar justifiable or
not? The actors in that deed justified themselves by saying,
that a tyrant and usurper, who meditated the destruction of
his country’s liberty, made it the duty of every citizen to put
him to death, and that Cæsar was a tyrant and usurper, etc.
Their reasoning was perfectly correct, though proceeding on
premisses then extensively, and now universally, denied. The
first premiss, though correctly used in this reasoning, is now
asserted to be false, on the ground that it is the duty of
every citizen to do nothing which would, were the practice
universal, militate against the general happiness; that were
each individual to act upon his own judgment, instead of
leaving offenders to the law, the result would be anarchy
and complete destruction of civilisation, etc. Now in these
on the study of mathematics. 232
reasonings and all others, with the exception of those which
occur in mathematics, it must be observed that there are no
premisses so certain, as never to have been denied, no first
principles to which the same degree of evidence is attached
as to the following, that “no two straight lines can enclose a
space.” In mathematics, therefore, we reason on certainties,
on notions to which the name of innate can be applied, if it
can be applied to any whatever. Some, on observing that we
dignify such simple consequences by the name of reasoning,
may be loth to think that this is the process to which they
used to attach such ideas of difficulty. There may, perhaps,
be many who imagine that reasoning is for the mathematician,
the logician, etc., and who, like the Bourgeois Gentilhomme,
may be surprised on being told, that, well or ill,
they have been reasoning all their lives. And yet such is the
fact; the commonest actions of our lives are directed by processes
exactly identical with those which enable us to pass
from one proposition of geometry to another. A porter, for
example, who being directed to carry a parcel from the city
to a street which he has never heard of, and who on inquiry,
finding it is in the Borough, concludes that he must cross
the water to get at it, has performed an act of reasoning,
differing nothing in kind from those by a series of which, did
he know the previous propositions, he might be convinced
that the square of the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle
is equal to the sum of the squares of the sides.
CHAPTER XV.
ON AXIOMS.
Geometry, then, is the application of strict logic to those
properties of space and figure which are self-evident, and
which therefore cannot be disputed. But the rigor of this
science is carried one step further; for no property, however
evident it may be, is allowed to pass without demonstration,
if that can be given. The question is therefore to demonstrate
all geometrical truths with the smallest possible number of
assumptions. These assumptions are called axioms, and for
an axiom it is requisite: (1) that it should be self-evident;
(2) that it should be incapable of being proved from the
other axioms. In fulfilling these conditions, the number of
axioms which are really geometrical, that is, which have not
equal reference to Arithmetic, is reduced to two, viz., two
straight lines cannot enclose a space, and through a given
point not more than one parallel can be drawn to a given
straight line. The first of these has never been considered as
open to any objection; it has always passed as perfectly selfevident.*
It is on this account made the proposition on which

Russell’s Foundations of Geometry (Cambridge, 1897). In Grassmann’s
Ausdehnungslehre (1844), “assumptions” and “axioms” are replaced
by purely formal (logical) “predications,” which presuppose merely the
consistency of mental operations. (See The Open Court, Vol. II. p. 1464,

evident in itself, and has therefore been called the defect
and disgrace of geometry. We proceed to place it on what
we conceive to be the proper footing.
By taking for granted the arithmetical axioms only, with
the first of those just alluded to, the following propositions
may be strictly shown.
I. One perpendicular, and only one, can be let fall from
any point A to a given line CD. Let this be AB.
II. If equal distances BC and BD be taken on both
sides of B, AC and AD are equal, as also the angles BAC
and BAD.

III. Whatever may be the length of BC and BD, the
of Philosophy (Chicago), p. 51 et seq., has treated the subject of Axioms
at length, from a similar point of view. On the psychological
side, consult Mach’s Analysis of the Sensations (Chicago, 1897), and
the bibliographical references and related discussions in such works as
James’s Psychology and Jodl’s Psychology (Stuttgart, 1896).—Ed.
on the study of mathematics. 236
angles BAC and BAD are each less than a right angle.
IV. Through A a line may be drawn parallel to CD (that
is, by definition, never meeting CD, though the two be ever
so far produced), by drawing any line AD and making the
angle DAE equal to the angle ADB, which it is before shown
how to do.
From proposition IV. we should at first see no reason
against there being as many parallels to CD, to be drawn
through A, as there are different ways of taking AD, since the
direction for drawing a parallel to CD is, “take any line AD
cutting CD and make the angle DAE equal to ADB.” But
this our senses immediately assure us is impossible.
It appears also a proposition to which no degree of doubt
can attach, that if the straight line AB, produced indefinitely
both ways, set out from the position AB and revolve round
the point A, moving first towards AE; then the point of intersection
D will first be on one side of B and afterwards on the
other, and there will be one position where there is no point
of intersection either on one side or the other, and one such
position only. This is in reality the assumption of Euclid; for
having proved that AE and BF are parallel when the angles
BDA and DAE are equal, or, which is the same thing, when
EAD and ADF are together equal to two right angles, he
further assumes that they will be parallel in no other case,
that is, that they will meet when the angles EAD and ADF
are together greater or less than two right angles; which is
really only assuming that the parallel which he has found is
the only one which can be drawn. The remaining part of
on axioms. 237
his axiom, namely, that the lines AE and DF, if they meet
at all, will meet upon that side of DA on which the angles
are less than two right angles, is not an assumption but a
consequence of his proposition which shows that any two angles
of a triangle are together less than two right angles, and
which is established before any mention is made of parallels.
It has been found by the experience of two thousand years
that some assumption of this sort is indispensable. Every
species of effort has been made to avoid or elude the diffi-
culty, but hitherto without success, as some assumption has
always been involved, at least equal, and in most cases superior,
in difficulty to the one already made by Euclid. For
example, it has been proposed to define parallel lines as those
which are equidistant from one another at every point. In
this case, before the name parallel can be allowed to belong
to any thing, it must be proved that there are lines such
that a perpendicular to one is always perpendicular to the
other, and that the parts of these perpendiculars intercepted
between the two are always equal. A proof of this has never
been given without the previous assumption of something
equivalent to the axiom of Euclid. Of this last, indeed, a
proof has been given, but involving considerations not usually
admitted into geometry, though it is more than probable
that had the same come down to us, sanctioned by the name
of Euclid, it would have been received without difficulty. The
Greek geometer confines his notion of equal magnitudes to
those which have boundaries. Suppose this notion of equality
extended to all such spaces as can be made to coincide
on the study of mathematics. 238
entirely in all their extent, what ever that extent may be; for
example, the unbounded spaces contained between two equal
angles whose sides are produced without end, which by the
definition of equal angles might be made to coincide entirely
by laying the sides of one angle upon those of the other. In
the same sense we may say, that, one angle being double another,
the space contained by the sides of the first is double
that contained by the sides of the second, and so on. Now
suppose two lines Oa and Ob, making any angle with one
Fig. 7.
another, and produced ad infinitum.
* On Oa take off the
equal spaces OP, P Q, QR, etc., ad infinitum, and draw the
lines P p, Qq, Rr, etc., so that the angles OP p, OQq, etc.,
*Every line in this figure must be produced ad infinitum, from that
extremity at which the small letter is placed.
on axioms. 239
shall be equal to one another, each being such as with bOP
will make two right angles. Then Ob, P p, Qq, etc., are parallel
to one another, and the infinite spaces bOP p, pP Qq,
qQRr, etc., can be made to coincide, and are equal. Also no
finite number whatever of these spaces will fill up the infinite
space bOa, since OP, P Q, etc., may be contained ad infinitum
upon the line Oa. Let there be any line Ot, such that
the angles tOP and pP O are together less than two right
angles, that is, less than bOP and pP O; whence tOP is less
than bOP and tO falls between bO and aO. Take the angles
tOv, vOw, wOx, each equal to bOt, and continue this until
the last line Oz falls beneath Oa, so that the angle bOz
is greater than bOa. That this is possible needs no proof,
since it is manifest that any angle being continually added
to itself the sum will in time exceed any other given angle;
again, the infinite spaces bOt, tOv, etc., are all equal. Now
on comparing the spaces bOt and bOP p, we see that a certain
number of the first is more than equal to the space bOa,
while no number whatever of the second is so great. We conclude,
therefore, that the space bOt is greater than bOP p,
which cannot be unless the line Ot cuts P p at last; for if
Ot did never cut P p, the space bOt would evidently be less
than bOP p, as the first would then fall entirely within the
second. Therefore two lines which make with a third angles
together less than two right angles will meet if sufficiently
produced. [See Note on page 241.]
This demonstration involves the consideration of a new
species of magnitude, namely, the whole space contained by
on the study of mathematics. 240
the sides of an angle produced without limit. This space
is unbounded, and is greater than any number whatever of
finite spaces, of square feet, for example. No comparison,
therefore, as to magnitude can be instituted between it and
any finite space whatever, but that affords no reason against
comparing this magnitude with others of the same kind.
Any thing may become the subject of mathematical reasoning,
which can be increased or diminished by other things
of the same kind; this is, in fact, the definition given of the
term magnitude; and geometrical reasoning, in all other cases
at least, can be applied as soon as a criterion of equality is
discovered. Thus the angle, to beginners, is a perfectly new
species of magnitude, and one of whose measure they have
no conception whatever; they see, however, that it is capable
of increase or diminution, and also that two of the kind can
be equal, and how to discover whether this is so or not, and
nothing more is necessary for them. All that can be said of
the introduction of the angle in geometry holds with some,
(to us it appears an equal force,) with regard to these unlimited
spaces; the two are very closely connected, so much so,
that the term angle might even be defined as “the unlimited
space contained by two right lines,” without alteration in
the truth of any theorem in which the word angle is found.
But this is a point which cannot be made very clear to the
beginner.
The real difficulties of geometry begin with the theory
of proportion, to which we now proceed. The points of discussion
which we have hitherto raised, are not such as to
on axioms. 241
embarrass the elementary student, however much they may
perplex the metaphysical inquirer into first principles. The
theory to which we are coming abounds in difficulties of both
classes.
[Note to Page 239.—The demonstration given on pp. 237–
239 is now regarded as fallacious by mathematicians; the considerations
that apply to finite aggregates not being transferable to
infinite aggregates,—for example, it is not true for infinite aggregates
that the part is always less than the whole. Even Plato is
cited for the assertion that equality is only to be predicated of
finite magnitudes. See the modern works on the Theory of the
Infinite. The demonstration in question is not De Morgan’s, but
M. Bertrand’s.—Ed.]
CHAPTER XVI.
ON PROPORTION.
In the first elements of geometry, two lines, or two surfaces,
are mentioned in no other relation to one another than that
of equality or non-equality. Nothing but the simple fact is
announced that one magnitude is equal to, greater than, or
less than another, except occasionally when the sum of two
equal magnitudes is said to be double one of them. Thus
in proving that two sides of a triangle are together greater
than the third, the fact that they are greater is the essence
of the proposition; no measure is given of the excess, nor
does anything follow from the theorem as to whether it is,
or may be, small or great. We now come to the doctrine of
proportion in which geometrical magnitude is considered in
a new light. The subject has some difficulties, which have
been materially augmented by the almost universal use, in
this country at least,* of the theory laid down in the fifth
book of Euclid.† Considered as a complete conquest over
a great and acknowledged difficulty of principle, this book
of Euclid well deserves the immortality of which its existence,
at the present moment, is the guarantee; nay, had
the speculations of the mathematician been wholly confined
to geometrical magnitude, it might be a question whether
any other notions would be necessary. But when we come

on proportion. 243
to apply arithmetic to geometry, it is necessary to examine
well the primary connexion between the two; and here diffi-
culties arise, not in comprehending that connexion so much
as in joining the two sciences by a chain of demonstration
as strong as that by which the propositions of geometry are
bound together, and as little open to cavil and disputation.
The student is aware that before pronouncing upon the
connexion of two lines with one another, it is necessary to
measure them, that is, to refer them to some third line, and
to observe what number of times the third is contained in
the other two. Whether the two first are equal or not is
readily ascertained by the use of the compasses, on principles
laid down with the utmost strictness in Euclid and other
elementary works. But this step is not sufficient; to say that
two lines are not equal, determines nothing. There are an
infinite number of ways in which one line may be greater or
less than a given line, though there is only one in which the
other can be equal to the given one. We proceed to show
how, from the common notion of measuring a line, the more
strict geometrical method is derived.
To measure the line AB, apply to it another line (the
edge of a ruler), which is divided into equal parts (as
inches), each of which parts is again subdivided into ten
equal parts, as in the figure. This division is made to take
place in practice until the last subdivision gives a part
so small that anything less may be neglected as inconsiderable.
Thus a carpenter’s rule is divided into tenths or
eighths of inches only, while in the tube of a barometer
on the study of mathematics. 244
a process must be employed which will mark a much less
difference. In talking of accurate measurement, therefore,
anywhere but in geometry, or algebra, we only mean accurate
Fig. 8.
as far as the senses are concerned, and as far as
is necessary for the object in view. The ruler
in the figure shows that the line AB contains
more than two and less than three inches; and
closer inspection shows that the excess above
two inches is more than sixth-tenths of an inch,
and less than seven. Here, in practice, the process
stops; for, as the subdivision of the ruler
was carried only to tenths of inches, because a
tenth of an inch is a quantity which may be neglected
in ordinary cases, we may call the line
two inches and six-tenths, by doing which the
error committed is less than one-tenth of an inch. In this
way lines may be compared together with a common degree
of correctness; but this is not enough for the geometer. His
notions of accuracy are not confined to tenths or hundredths,
or hundred-millionth parts of any line, however small it may
be at first. The reason is obvious; for although to suit the eye
of the generality of readers, figures are drawn in which the
least line is usually more than an inch, yet his theorems are
asserted to remain true, even though the dimensions of the
figure are so far diminished as to make the whole imperceptible
in the strongest microscope. Many theorems are obvious
upon looking at a moderately-sized figure; but the reasoning
must be such as to convince the mind of their truth when,
on proportion. 245
from excessive increase or diminution of the scale, the figures
themselves have past the boundary even of imagination. The
next step in the process of measurement is as follows, and
will lead us to the great and peculiar difficulty of the subject.
The inch, the foot, and the other lengths by which we
compare lines with one another, are perfectly arbitrary.
There is no reason for their being what they are, unless we
adopt the commonly received notion that our inch is derived
from our Saxon ancestors, who observed that a barley corn
is always of the same length, or nearly so, and placed three
of them together as a common standard of measure, which
they called an inch. Any line whatever may be chosen as
the standard of measure, and it is evident that when two
or more lines are under consideration, exact comparisons
of their lengths can only be obtained from a line which is
contained an exact number of times in them all. For even
exact fractional measures are reduced to the same denominator,
in order to compare their magnitudes. Thus, two
lines which contain 2
11 and 3
7
of a foot, are better compared
by observing that 2
11 and 3
7
being 14
77 and 33
77 , the given lines
contain one 77th part of a foot 14 and 33 times respectively.
Any line which is contained an exact number of times in
another is called in geometry a measure of it, and a common
measure of two or more lines is that which is contained an
exact number of times in each.
Again, a line which is measured by another is called a
multiple of it, as in arithmetic.
The same definition, mutatis mutandis, applies to sur-
on the study of mathematics. 246
faces, solids, and all other magnitudes; and though in our
succeeding remarks we use lines as an illustration, it must
be recollected that the reasoning applies equally to every
magnitude which can be made the subject of calculation.
In order that two quantities may admit of comparison as
to magnitude, they must be of the same sort; if one is a line,
the other must be a line also. Suppose two lines A and B
each of which is measured by the line C; the first containing
it five times and the second six. These lines A and B, which
contain the same line C five and six times respectively, are
said to have to one another the ratio of five to six, or to be
in the proportion of five to six. If then we denote the first
by A,
* and the second by B, and the common measure by C,
*The student must distinctly understand that the common meaning
of algebraical terms is departed from in this chapter, wherever the
letters are large instead of small. For example, A, instead of meaning
the number of units of some sort or other contained in the line A, stands
for the line A itself, and mA (the small letters throughout meaning
whole numbers) stands for the line made by taking A, m times. Thus
such expressions as mA+B, mA-nB, etc., are the only ones admissible.

on proportion. 247
we have
A = 5C, or 6A = 30C,
B = 6C, or 5B = 30C,
whence 6A = 5B, or 6A - 5B = 0.
Generally, when mA - nB = 0, the lines, or whatever
they are, represented by A and B, are said to be in the
proportion of n to m, or to have the ratio of n to m.
Let there be two other magnitudes P and Q, of the same
kind with one another, either differing from the first in kind
or not, (thus A and B may be lines, and P and Q surfaces,
etc.,) and let them contain a common measure R, just as
A and B contain C, viz.: Let P contain R five times, and
let Q contain R six times, we have by the same reasoning
6P - 5Q = 0,
and P and Q, being also in the ratio of five to six, as well as
A and B, are said to be proportional to A and B, which is
denoted thus
A : B :: P : Q,
by which at present all we mean is this, that there are some
two whole numbers m and n such that, at the same time
mA - nB = 0,
mP - nQ = 0.
on the study of mathematics. 248
Fig. 9.
Nothing more than this would
be necessary for the formation
of a complete theory of proportion,
if the common measure,
which we have supposed to exist
in the definition, did always
really exist. We have, however,
no right to assume that two
lines A and B, whatever may be
their lengths, both contain some
other line an exact number of
times. We can, moreover, produce
a direct instance in which
two lines have no common measure
what ever, in the following manner.
Let ABC be an isosceles right-angled triangle, the
side BC and the hypothenuse have no common measure
whatever. If possible let D be a common measure of BC
and AB; let BC contain D, n times, and let AB contain D,
m times. Let E be the square described on D. Then since
AB contains D, m times, the square described on AB contains,
m × m or m2
times. Similarly the square described
on BC contains E n×n or n
2
times. But, because AB is an
isosceles right-angled triangle, the square on AB is double
that on BC, whence m × m = 2(n × n) or m2 = 2n
2
. To
prove the impossibility of this equation (when m and n are
whole numbers), observe that m2 must be an even number,
since it is twice the number n
2
. But m×m cannot be an even
on proportion. 249
number unless m is an even number, since an odd number
multiplied by itself produces an odd number.* Let m (which
has been shown to be even) be double m0 or m = 2m0
.
Then 2m0 × 2m0 = 2n
2 or 4m02 = 2n
2 or n
2 = 2m02
. By
repeating the same reasoning we show that n is even. Let it
be 2n
0
. Then 2n
0 × 2n
0 = 2m02 or m02 = 2n
02
. By the same
reasoning m0 and n
0 are both even, and so on ad infinitum.
This reasoning shows that the whole numbers which satisfy
the equation n
2 = 2m2
(if such there be) are divisible by 2
without remainder, ad infinitum. The absurdity of such
a supposition is manifest: there are then no such whole
numbers, and consequently no common measure to BA
and BC.
Before proceeding any further, it will be necessary to establish
the following proposition.
If the greater of two lines A and B be divided into m equal
parts, and one of these parts be taken away; if the remainder
be then divided into m equal parts, and one of them be taken
away, and so on,—the remainder of the line A shall in time
become less than the line B, how small soever the line B
may be.
Take a line which is less than B, and call it C. It is
evident that, by a continual addition of the same quantity
*Every odd number, when divided by 2, gives a remainder 1, and
is therefore of the form 2p + 1 where p is a whole number. Multiply
2p+ 1 by itself, which gives 4p
2 + 4p+ 1, or 2(2p
2 + 2p) + 1, which is an
odd number, since, when divided by 2, it gives the quotient 2p
2 + 2p,
a whole number, and the remainder 1.
on the study of mathematics. 250
to C, this last will come in time to exceed A; and still more
will it do so if the quantity added to C be increased at each
step. To simplify the proof we suppose that 20 is the number
of equal parts into which A and its remainders are successively
divided, so that 19 out of the 20 parts remain after
subtraction.
Divide C into 19 equal parts and add to C a line equal
to one of these parts. Let the length of C, so increased,
be C
0
. Divide C
0
into 19 equal parts and let C
0
, increased
by its 19th part, be C
00. Now, since we add more and more
each time to C, in forming C
0
, C
00, etc, we shall in time
exceed A. Let this have been done, and let D be the line
so obtained, which is greater than A. Observe now that
C
0
contains 19, and C
00, 20 of the same parts, whence C
0
is
made by dividing C
00 into 20 parts and removing one of them.
The same of all the rest. Therefore we may return from D
to C by dividing D into 20 parts, removing one of them,
and repeating the process continually. But C is less than B
by hypothesis. If then we can, by this process, reduce D
below B, still more can we do so with A, which is less than D,
by the same method.
This depends on the obvious truth, that if, at the end
of any number of subtractions (D being taken), we have
left p
q
D, at the end of the same number of subtractions
(A being taken), we shall have p
q
A, since the method pursued
in both cases is the same. But since A is less than D,
on proportion. 251
p
q
A is less than p
q
D, which becomes equal to C, therefore
p
q
A becomes less than C.
*
We now resume the isosceles right-angled triangle. The
lines BC and AB, which were there shown to have no common
measure, are called incommensurable quantities, and to
their existence the theory of proportion owes its difficulties.
We can nevertheless show that A and B being incommensurable,
a line can be found as near to B as we please, either
greater or less, which is commensurable with A. Let
D be any line taken at pleasure, and therefore as small as
we please. Divide A into two equal parts, each of those parts
into two equal parts, and so on. We shall thus at last find a
part of A which is less than D. Let this part be E, and let it
be contained m times in A. In the series E, 2E, 3E, etc., we
shall arrive at last at two consecutive terms, pE and (p+1)E
of which the first is less, and the second greater than B. Neither
of these differs from B by so much as E; still less by so

much as D; and both pE and (p + 1)E are commensurable
with A, that is with mE, since E is a common measure of
both. If therefore A and B are incommensurable, a third
magnitude can be found, either greater or less than B, differing
from B by less than a given quantity, which magnitude
shall be commensurable with A.
We have seen that when A and B are incommensurable,
there are no whole values of m and n, which will satisfy the
equation mA - nB = 0; nevertheless, we can prove that
values of m and n can be found which will make mA - nB
less than any given magnitude C, of the same kind, how
small soever it may be. Suppose, that for certain values of
m and n,
* we find mA - nB = E, and let the first multiple
of E, which is greater than B, be pE, so that pE = B + E

It is necessary here to observe, that in speaking of the expression
mA-nB we more frequently refer to its form than to any actual value
of it, derived from supposing m and n to have certain known values.
When we say that mA - nB can be made smaller than C, we mean
that some values can be given to m and n such that mA - nB < C,
or that some multiple of B subtracted from some multiple of A is less
than C. The following expressions are all of the same form, viz., that
of some multiple of B subtracted from some multiple of A:
mA - nB,
mpA - (np + 1)B,
2mA - 4mB, etc., etc.
on proportion. 253
pE - E, which is B + (E
0 - E), would be greater than B,
which is against the supposition.
The equation mA - nB = E gives
pmA - pnB = pE = B + E
0
,
whence
pmA - (pn + 1)B = E

Let
pm = m0
and pn + 1 = n

we have therefore still further diminished the difference of
the multiples; and the process may be repeated any number
of times; it only remains to show that the diminution may
proceed to any extent.
This will appear superfluous to the beginner, who will
probably imagine that a quantity diminished at every step,
must, by continuing the number of steps, at last become as
small as we please. Nevertheless if any number, as 10, be
taken and its square root extracted, and the square root of
that square root, and so on, the result will not be so small
as unity, although ten million of square roots should have
been extracted. Here is a case of continual diminution, in
which the diminution is not without limit. Again, from the
point D in the line AB draw DE, making an angle with AB
less than half a right angle. Draw BE perpendicular to AB,
Fig. 10.
and take BC = BE. Draw CF perpendicular to AB, and
take CC0 = CF, and so on. The points C, C

00, etc., will
always be further from A than D is; and all the lines AC,
AC0
, AC00, etc., though diminished at every step, will always
remain greater than AD. Some such species of diminution,
for anything yet proved to the contrary, may take place
on proportion. 255

The numbers p, p

that p, p
0
, etc., can only remain the same for a finite number
of steps, and must then increase, and after the increase can
only remain the same for another finite number of steps,
and then must increase again, and so on, we show that the
process can be continued, until one of them is as great as
we please; let this be p

marks the number which our notation will have reached, and
indicates the (z + 1)th step of the process. Let E

where E

its present place through so many steps of the process
as will, if the same number of terms be taken, give
1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + etc., greater than 54; that is, it cannot
be the same for six steps. And we find, on actually performing
the operations,
2 × 54f = 55 + 53f

times which E contains E - E

remain the same longer. By repetition of the same process,
we can show that a further and further increase must take
place, and so on until we have attained a quantity greater
than any given one. And it has already been shown to be
a consequence of this, that mA - nB can be diminished to
any extent we please. Similarly it may be shown that when
A and B are incommensurable, mA-nB may be brought as
near as we please to any other quantity C, of the same kind
as A and B, so as not to differ from C by so much as a given
quantity E. For let m and n be taken, by the last case, so
that mA-nB may be less than E, and let mA-nB, in this
case, be equal to E

neither of which can differ from C by so much as E

therefore not by so much as E. Then since

on proportion. 259
The common ideas of proportion are grounded entirely
upon the false notion that all quantities of the same sort
are commensurable. That the supposition is practically correct,
if there are any limits to the senses, may be shown,
for let any quantity be rejected as imperceptible, then since
a quantity can be found as near to B as we please, which
is commensurable with A, the difference between B and its
approximate commensurable magnitude, may be reduced below
the limits of perceptible quantity. Nevertheless, inaccuracy
to some extent must infest all general conclusions drawn
from the supposition that A and B being two magnitudes,
whole numbers, m and n, can always be found such that
mA - nB = 0. We have shown that this can be brought
as near to the truth as we please, since mA - nB can be
made as small as we please. This, however, is not a perfect
answer, at least it wants the unanswerable force of all the
preceding reasonings in geometry. A definition of proportion
should therefore be substituted, which, while it reduces itself,
in the case of commensurable quantities to the one already
given, is equally applicable to the case of incommensurables.
We proceed to examine the definition already given with a
view to this object.

Or, if four magnitudes are proportional, according to the
common notion, it follows that the same multiples of the first
and third being taken, and also of the second and fourth,
the multiple of the first is greater than, equal to, or less
than, that of the second, according as that of the third is
greater than, equal to, or less than, that of the fourth. This
property* necessarily follows from the equations
mA - nB = 0,
mP - nQ = 0,

It would be expressed algebraically by saying that if mA-nB and
mP - nQ are nothing for the same values of m and n, they are either
both positive or both negative, for every other value of m and n.
on the study of mathematics. 262
but it does not therefore follow that the equations are necessary
consequences of the property, since the latter may
possibly be true of incommensurable quantities, of which,
by definition, the former is not. The existence of this property
is Euclid’s definition of proportion: he says, let four
magnitudes, two and two, of the same kind, be called proportional,
when, if equi-multiples be taken of the first and
third, etc., repeating the property just enunciated. What is
lost and gained by adopting Euclid’s definition may be very
simply stated; the gain is an entire freedom from all the difficulties
of incommensurable quantities, and even from the
necessity of inquiring into the fact of their existence, and the
removal of the inaccuracy attending the supposition that, of
two quantities of the same kind, each is a determinate arithmetical
fraction of the other; on the other hand, there is no
obvious connexion between Euclid’s definition and the ordinary
and well-established ideas of proportion; the definition
itself is made to involve the idea of infinity, since all possible
multiples of the four quantities enter into it; and lastly, the
very existence of the four quantities, called proportional, is
matter for subsequent demonstration, since to a beginner it
cannot but appear very unlikely that there are any magnitudes
which satisfy the definition. The last objection is not
very strong, since the learner could read the first proposition
of the sixth book immediately after the definition, and would
thereby be convinced of the existence of proportionals; the
rest may be removed by showing another definition, more in
consonance with common ideas, and demonstrating that, if
on proportion. 263
four magnitudes fall under either of these definitions, they
fall under the other also. The definition which we propose is
as follows: “Four magnitudes, A, B, P, and Q, of which B is
of the same kind as A, and Q as P, are said to be proportional,
if magnitudes B +C and Q+R can be found as near
as we please to B and Q, so that A, B + C, P and Q + R,
are proportional according to the common notion, that is, if
whole numbers m and n can satisfy the equations
mA - n(B + C) = 0,
mP - n(Q + R) = 0.”
We have now to show that Euclid’s definition follows from
the one just given, and also that the last follows from Euclid’s,
that is, if there are four magnitudes which fall under
either definition, they fall under the other also. Let us first
suppose that Euclid’s definition is true of A, B, P, and Q,
so that
mA

This being true, it will follow that we can take m and n, so
as not only to make mA-nB less than a given magnitude E,
which may be as small as we please, but also so that mP -nQ
shall at the same time be less than a given magnitude F,
however small this last may be. For if not, while m and n
are so taken as to make mA - nB less than E (which it has
been proved can be done, however small E may be) suppose,
if possible, that the same values of m and n will never make
on the study of mathematics. 264
mP - nQ less than some certain quantity F, and let E be
the first multiple of F which exceeds Q, and also let E be
taken so small that pE shall be less than B, still more then
shall p(mA - nB), or pmA - pnB be less than B. But since
pF is greater than Q, and mP -nQ is by hypothesis greater
than F, still more shall mpP - npQ be greater than Q. We
have then, if our last supposition be correct, some value of
mp and np, for which
mpA - npB is less than B,
while
mpP - npQ is greater than Q,
or
mpA is less than (np + 1)B,
mpP is greater than (np + 1)Q,
which is contrary to our first hypothesis respecting A, B, P,
and Q, that hypothesis being Euclid’s definition of proportion,
from which if
mpA is less than (np + 1)B,
mpP is less than (np + 1)Q.
We must therefore conclude that if the four quantities A, B,
P, and Q satisfy Euclid’s definition of proportion, then
m and n may be so taken that mA-nB and mP -nQ shall
be as small as we please.
on proportion. 265
Let
mA - nB = E and E = nC,
mP - nQ = F and F = nR.
Then
mA - n(B + C) = 0,
mP - n(Q + R) = 0,
and since E and F can, by properly assuming m and n,
be made as small as we please, much more can the same be
done with C and R, consequently we can produce B +C and
Q + R as near as we please to B and Q, and proportional to
A and P, according to the common arithmetical notion. In
the same way it may be proved, that on the same hypothesis
B - C and Q - R can be found as near to B and Q as we
please, and so that A, B - C, P and Q - R are proportional
according to the ordinary notion. It only remains to show
that if the last-mentioned property be assumed, Euclid’s definition
of proportion will follow from it. That is, if quantities
can be exhibited as near to P and Q as we please, which are
proportional to A and B, according to the ordinary notion,
it follows that

fP - g(Q + R) = 0,

in which, by the hypothesis, f and g can be so taken that C
and R are as small as we please. We have already shown that
in this case (m and n being any numbers whatever) mA is
never greater or less than n(B + C), without mP being at
the same time the same with regard to n(Q + R). That is, if
mA is greater than nB + nC,
then
mP is greater than nQ + nR.
Take some given* values for m and n, fulfilling the first condition;
then, since C and R may be as small as we please,
the same is true of nC and nR; if then
mA is greater than nB,
mP is greater than nQ.
For if not, let mA = nB + x, while mP = nQ - y, x and y
being some definite magnitudes. Then if
nB + x > nB + nC,
nQ - y > nQ + nR,

It is very necessary to recollect that the relations just expressed are
true for every value of m and n; and therefore true for any particular
case. In this investigation f and g may both be very great in order
that C and R may be sufficiently small, and we must suppose them to
vary with the values we give to C and R, or rather the limits which we
assign to them; but m and n are given.
on proportion. 267
which last equation is evidently impossible; therefore if
mA > nB, mP > nQ. In the same way it may be proved
that if mA < nB, mP < nQ, etc., so that Euclid’s definition
is shown to be a necessary consequence of the one proposed.
The definition of proportion which we have here given,
and the methods by which we have established its identity
with the one in use, bear a close analogy to the process used
by the ancients, and denominated by the moderns the method
of exhaustions. We have seen that the common definition of
proportion fails in certain cases where the magnitudes are
what we have called incommensurable, but at the same time
we have shown that though in this case we can never take
m and n, so that mA = nB, or mA - nB = 0, we can
nevertheless find m and n, so that mA shall differ from nB
by a quantity less than any which we please to assign. We
therefore extend the definition of the word proportion, and
make it embrace not only those magnitudes which fulfil a
given condition, but also others, of which it is impossible
that they should fulfil that condition, provided always, that
whatever magnitudes we call by the name of proportionals,
they must be such as to admit of other magnitudes being
taken as near as we please to the first, which are proportional,
according to the common arithmetical notion. It is
on the same principle that in algebra we admit the existence
of such a quantity as v
2, and use it in the same manner as a
definite fraction, although there is no such fraction in reality
as, multiplied by itself, will give 2 as the product. But, however
small a quantity we may name, we can assign a fraction
on the study of mathematics. 268
which, multiplied by itself, shall differ less from 2 than that
quantity.
Having established the properties of rectilinear figures,
as far as their proportions are concerned, it is necessary to
ascertain the properties of curvilinear figures in this respect.
And here occurs a difficulty of the same kind as that which
met us at the outset, for no rectilinear figure, how small
soever its sides may be, or how great soever their number,
can be called curvilinear. Nevertheless, it may be shown that
in every curve a rectilinear figure may be inscribed, whose
area and perimeter shall differ from the area and perimeter of
the curve by magnitudes less than any assigned magnitudes.
The circle is the only curve whose properties are considered
in elementary geometry, and the proposition in question is
discussed in all standard treatises on geometry. Indeed, for
this or any other curve the proposition is almost self-evident.
This being granted, the properties of curvilinear figures are
established by help of the following theorem.
If A, B, C, and D are always proportional, and of these,
if C and D may be made as near as we please to P and Q,
than which they are always both greater or both less, then
A, B, P, and Q are proportional.
Let C = P + P
0
, and D = Q + Q0
, where by hypothesis
P
0 and Q0 may be made as small as we please, and A, B,
P + P
0
, and Q + Q0 are proportionals. If A, B, P, and Q
are not proportionals, let P and Q + R be proportional to
A and B. Then, since A and B are proportional to P + P

, and also to P and Q + R, therefore
P + P

:: P : Q + R
in which all the magnitudes are of the same kind. Now let
P
0 and Q0 be so taken that Q0
is less than R, which may be
done, since by hypothesis Q0
can be as small as we please.
Hence Q+Q0
is less than Q+R, and therefore P +P
0
is less
than P, which is absurd. In the same way it may be proved
that P is not to Q-R in the proportion of A to B, and consequently
P is to Q in the proportion of A to B. This theorem,
with those which prove that the surfaces, solidities, areas,
and lengths, of curve lines and surfaces, may be represented
as nearly as we please by the surfaces, etc., of rectilinear figures
and solids, form the method of exhaustions.*
In this
method are the first germs of that theory which, under the
name of Fluxions, or the Differential Calculus, contains the
principles of all the methods of investigation now employed,
whether in pure or mixed mathematics.

CHAPTER XVII.
APPLICATION OF ALGEBRA TO THE MEASUREMENT
OF LINES, ANGLES, PROPORTION OF
FIGURES, AND SURFACES.
We have already defined a measure, and have noticed several
instances of magnitudes of one kind being measured by those
of another. But the most useful measure, and that with
which we are most familiar, is number. We express one line
by the number of times which another line is repeated in
it, or if the second is not exactly contained in the first, by
the greatest number of the second contained in the first,
together with the fraction of the second, which will complete
the first. Thus, suppose the line A contains B m times, with
a remainder which can be formed by dividing B into q parts,
and taking p of them. Then B is to A in the proportion of
1 to m +
p
q
, or as q to mq +p, and if B be a fixed line, which
is used for the comparison of all lines whatsoever, then the
line A is m+
p
q
, or
mq + p
q
, if it be understood that for every
unit in m, B is to be taken, and also that for p
q
the same
fraction of B is to be taken that p
q
is of unity. In this case
B is called the linear unit.
But here we suppose that a line B being taken, the ratio
of any other line A to B can be expressed by that of the whole
numbers mq+p to q, which we have shown in some cases to be
on the application of algebra, etc. 271
impossible. If we take one of these cases, mA-nB, though it
can never be made equal to nothing, can be made as small as
we please, by properly assuming m and n. Let mA-nB = E,
then A =
n
m
B +
E
m
, and since E
m
can be made as small as
we please, A can be represented as nearly as we please by a
fraction n
m
, where B is the linear unit. Hence, in practice
an approximation may be found to the value of A, sufficient
for any purpose whatever, in the following manner, which
will be easily understood by the student who has a tolerable
facility in performing the operations of algebra. Let
A contain B, p times with a remainder P,
B contain P, q times with a remainder Q,
P contain Q, r times with a remainder R,
and so on. If the two magnitudes are commensurable, this
operation will end by one of the remainders becoming nothing.
For, let A and B have a common measure E, then
P has the same measure, for P is A - pB, of which both
A and pB contain E an exact number of times. Again, because
B and P contain the common measure E, Q has the
same measure, and so on. All the remainders are therefore
multiples of E, and if E be the linear unit, are represented
by whole numbers. Now, if a whole number be continually
diminished by a whole number, it must, if the operation can
be continued without end, eventually become nothing. If,
therefore, the remainder never disappears, it is a sign that
on the study of mathematics. 272
the magnitudes A and B are incommensurable. Nevertheless,
approximate whole numbers can be found whose ratio
is as near as we please to the ratio of A and B.
From the suppositions above mentioned it appears that
A = pB + P,*
(a)
B = qP + Q, (b)
P = rQ + R, (c)
Q = sR + S, (d)
R = tS + T, (e)
etc., etc.
Substitute in (b) the value of P derived from (a), find Q from
the result, and substitute the values of P and Q in (c); find
a value of R from the result, and substitute the values of
Q and R in (d), and so on, which give the following series of
equations:
A = pB + P,
qA = (pq + 1)B - Q,
(qr + 1)A = (pqr + p + r)B + R,
(qrs + q + s)A = (pqrs + ps + rs + pq + 1)B - S,
(qrst + qt + st + qr + 1)A =
(pqrst + pst + rst + pqt + pqr + p + r + t)B + T.

lines themselves, and not the numbers of units, which represent them,
while the small letters are whole numbers, as in the last chapter.
on the application of algebra, etc. 273
On inspection it will be found that the coefficients of
A and B in these equations may be formed by a very simple
law. In each a letter is introduced which was not in the
preceding one, and every coefficient is formed from the two
preceding, by multiplying the one immediately preceding
by the new letter, and adding to the product the one
which comes before that. Thus the third coefficient of B
is pqr + p + r; the new letter is r, and the two preceding
coefficients are pq + 1 and p, and pqr + p + r = (pq + 1)r + p.
The remainders enter also with signs alternately positive
and negative. Let x, x
0 and x
00 be the n
th, (n + 1)th
,
and (n + 2)th numbers of the series p, q, r, etc., and
X, X0
, and X00 the corresponding remainders. Let the
corresponding equations be
a A = b B + X,
a
0 A = b
0 B - X
0
,
a
00A = b
00B + X
00
.
Here n must be supposed odd, since, were it even, the
first equation would be aA = bB - X, as will be seen by
reference to the equations deduced. Hence, from the law of
formation of the coefficients, x
00 being the new letter in the
last equation,
a
00 = a

b
00 = b

every fraction is greater or less than the one which comes
before it, according as the number of its equation is even
or odd. Again, as the numerator of the difference of two

same must be that of the second, third, etc., and of all the
rest. But the numerator of the difference of p

by eliminating A we have

since ab0 - a

whatever, by carrying the process far enough, B

may be
made as small as we please, and `a fortiori, the remainders
may be made as small as we please.
The same theorem may be proved in a similar way, if we
begin at an even step of the process. Resuming the equations

We have thus shown how to find the representation of a
line by means of a linear unit, which is incommensurable with
it, to any degree of nearness which we please. This, though
little used in practice, is necessary to the theory; and the
student will see that the method here followed is nearly the
same as that of continued fractions in algebra.*
We now come to the measurement of an angle; and here
it must be observed that there are two distinct measures
employed, one exclusively in theory, and one in practice.
*See Lagrange’s Elementary Mathematics (Chicago, 1898), p. 2
et seq.—Ed.
on the study of mathematics. 278
The latter is the well-known division of the right angle into
90 equal parts, each of which is one degree; that of the degree
into 60 equal parts, each of which is one minute; and of
the minute into 60 parts, each of which is one second. On
these it is unnecessary to enlarge, as this division is perfectly
arbitrary, and no reason can be assigned, as far as theory is
concerned, for conceiving the right angle to be so divided.
But it is far otherwise with the measure which we come to
consider, to which we shall be naturally led by the theorems
relating to the circle. Assume any angle, AOB, as the angular
unit, and any other angle, AOC (Fig. 11). Let r be
the number* of linear units contained in the radius OA, and
Fig. 11.
t and s the lengths, or number of units contained in the arcs
AB and AC. Then since the angles AOB and AOC are proportional
to the arcs AB and AC, or to the numbers t and s,

It must be recollected that the word number means both whole
and fractional number.
on the application of algebra, etc. 279
we have
Angle AOC is
s
t
of the angle AOB;
and the angle AOB being the angular unit, the number s
t
is that which expresses the angle AOC. This number is
the same for the same angle, whatever circle is chosen; in
the circle F D the proportion of the arcs DE and DF is the
same as that of AB and AC: for since similar arcs of different
circles are proportional to their radii,
AB : DE :: OA : OD.
Also
AC : DF :: OA : OD,
? AB : DE :: AC : DF;
therefore the proportion of DF to DE is that of s to t, and
s
t
is the measure of the angle DOF, DOE being the unit, as
before. It only remains to choose the angular unit AOB, and
here that angle naturally presents itself, whose arc is equal to
the radius in length. This, from what is proved in Geometry,
will be the same for all circles, since in two circles, arcs which
have the same ratio (in this case that of equality) to their
radii, subtend the same angle. Let t = r, then s
r
is the
number corresponding to the angle whose arc is s. This is the
on the study of mathematics. 280
number which is always employed in theory as the measure
of an angle, and it has the advantage of being independent
of all linear units; for suppose s and r to be expressed, for
example, in feet, then 12s and 12r are the numbers of inches
in the same lines, and by the common theory of fractions
s
r
=
12s
12r
. Generally, the alteration of the unit does not affect
the number which expresses the ratio of two magnitudes.
When it is said that the angle = arc
radius, it is only meant
that, on one particular supposition, (namely, that the angle 1
is that angle whose arc is equal to the radius,) the number
of these units in any other angle is found by dividing the
number of linear units in its arc by the number of linear units
in the radius. It only remains to give a formula for finding the
number of degrees, minutes, and seconds in an angle, whose
theoretical measure is given. It is proved in geometry that
the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, or
that of half the circumference to its radius, though it cannot
be expressed exactly, is between 3.14159265 and 3.14159266.
Taking the last of these, which will be more than a sufficient
approximation for our purpose, it follows that the radius
being r, one-half of the circumference is r × 3.14159266; and
one-fourth of the circumference, or the arc of a right angle, is
r × 1.57079633. Hence the number of units above described,
in a right angle, is arc
radius, or 1.57079633. And the number
of seconds in a right angle is 90 × 60 × 60, or 324000. Hence
if ? be an angle expressed in units of the first kind, and
on the application of algebra, etc. 281
A the number of seconds in the same angle, the proportion
of A to 324000 will also be that of ? to 1.57079633. To
understand this, recollect that the proportion of any angle to
the right angle is not altered by changing the units in which
both are expressed, so that the numbers which express the
two for one unit, are proportional to the like numbers for
another.
Hence
A : 324000 :: ? : 1.57079633;
or
A =
324000
1.57079633
× ?;
or
A = 206265 × ?, very nearly.
Suppose, for example, the number of seconds in the theoretical
unit itself is required. Here ? = 1 and A = 206265;
similarly if A be 1, ? =
1
206265
, which is the expression for
the angle of one second referred to the other unit. In this
way, any angle, whose number of seconds is given, may be
expressed in terms of the angle whose arc is equal to the
radius, which, for distinction, might be called the theoretical
unit.* This unit is used without exception in analysis; thus,
*Also called a radian. See Beman and Smith’s Geometry, p. 192.—

If x be an angle of one second, it is not 1 which must be

The number 3.14159265, etc., is called p, and is the measure,
in theoretical units, of two right angles. Also p
2
is the
measure of one right angle; but it must not be confounded,
as is frequently done, with 90?
. It is true that they stand for
the same angle, but on different suppositions with respect
to the unit; the unit of the first being very nearly 206265
60 × 60
times that of the second.
There are methods of ascertaining the value of one magnitude
by means of another, which, though it varies with the
first, is not a measure of it, since the increments of the two
are not proportional; for example, when, if the first be doubled,
the second, though it changes in a definite manner, is
not doubled. Such is the connexion between a number and its
common logarithm, which latter increases much more slowly
than its number; since, while the logarithm changes from 0
to 1, and from 1 to 2, the number changes from 1 to 10, and
from 10 to 100, and so on.
Now, of all triangles which have the same angles, the

are equiangular; that is, one angle being given, which
is not a right angle, the proportions of every right-angled
triangle in which that angle occurs are given also; and, vice
versa, if the proportion, or ratio of any two sides of a rightangled
triangle are given, the angles of the triangle are given.

To these ratios names are given; and as the ratios themselves
are connected with the angles, so that one of either set
being given, viz., ratios or angles, all of both are known, their
names bear in them the name of the angle to which they are
supposed to be referred. Thus, BC

registered. We say sines, cosines, and tangents only, because
it is evident, from the table above made, that the cosecant,
secant, and cotangent of any angle, are the reciprocals of its
sine, cosine, and tangent, respectively. Again, the table need
only include 45?
, instead of the whole right angle, because,
the sine of an angle above 45? being the cosine of its complement,
which is less than 45?
, is already registered. Now,
as all rectilinear figures can be divided into triangles, and
every triangle is either right-angled, or the sum or difference
of two right-angled triangles, a table of this sort is ultimately
a register of the proportions of all figures whatsoever. The
rules for applying these tables form the subject of trigonometry,
which is one of the great branches of the application of
algebra to geometry. In a right-angled triangle, whose angles
do not contain an exact number of minutes, the proportions
may be found from the tables by the method explained in
Chapter XI. of this treatise. It must be observed, that the
sine, cosine, etc., are not measures of their angle; for, though
the angle is given when either of them is given, yet, if the angle
be increased in any proportion, the sine is not increased
in the same proportion. Thus, sin 2A is not double of sin A.
The measurement of surfaces may be reduced to the measurement
of rectangles; since every figure may be divided into
triangles, and every triangle is half of a rectangle on the same
base and altitude. The superficial unit or quantity of space,
in terms of which it is chosen to express all other spaces, is
perfectly arbitrary; nevertheless, a common theorem points
out the convenience of choosing, as the superficial unit, the

square on that line which is chosen as the linear unit. If
the sides of a rectangle contain a and b units, the rectangle
itself contains ab of the squares described on the unit.
This proposition is true, even when a and b are fractional.
Let the number of units in the sides be m
n
and p
q
, and take
another unit which is 1
nq
of the first, or is obtained by dividing
the first unit into nq parts, and taking one of them.
Then, by the proposition just quoted, the square described
on the larger unit contains nq × nq of that described on the
smaller. Again, since m
n
and p
q
are the same fractions as
mp
nq
and np
nq
, they are formed by dividing the first unit into
nq parts, and taking one of these parts mq and np times; that
is, they contain mq and np of the smaller unit; and, therefore,
the rectangle contained by them, contains mq × np of
the square described on the smaller unit. But of these there
are nq × nq in the square on the longer unit; and, therefore,
mq × np
nq × nq
, or
mp × nq
nq × nq
, or
mp
nq
, is the number of the
larger squares contained in the rectangle. But mp
nq
is the
algebraical product of m
n
and p
q
. This proposition is true
in the following sense, where the sides of the rectangle are
incommensurable with the unit. Whatever the unit may be,
we have shown that, for any incommensurable magnitude,
we can go on finding b and a, two whole numbers, so that

the approximate fractions which represent AC and AB may
be brought so near, that their product shall, as nearly as we
please, represent the number of square units in their rectangle.
In precisely the same manner it may be proved, that if
the unit of content or solidity be the cube described on the
unit of length, the number of cubical units in any rectangular
parallelepiped, is the product of the number of linear
units in its three sides, whether these numbers be whole or
fractional; and in the sense just established, even if they be
incommensurable with the unit.
These algebraical relations between the sides and content
of a rectangle or parallelepiped were observed by the Greek
geometers; but as they had no distinct science of algebra, and
a very imperfect system of arithmetic, while, with them, geometry
was in an advanced state; instead of applying algebra
to geometry, what they knew of the first was by deduction
from the last: hence the names which, to this day, are given
to aa, aaa, ab, which are called the square of a, the cube of a,
the rectangle of a and b. The student is thus led to imagine
that he has proved that square described on the line whose
number of units is a, to contain aa square units, because he
calls the latter the square of a. He must, however, recollect,
that squares in algebra and geometry mean distinct things.
It would be much better if he would accustom himself to
call aa and aaa the second and third powers of a, by which
means the confusion would be avoided. It is, nevertheless,
on the study of mathematics. 290
too much to expect that a method of speaking, so commonly
received, should ever be changed; all that can be done is,
to point out the real connexion of the geometrical and algebraical
signification. This, if once thoroughly understood,
will prevent any future misconception.
