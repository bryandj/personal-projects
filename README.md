## Welcome to my repository of personal data science(ish) mini-projects.

These activities were completely independent from any of my prevous industry or academic sources of funding or research ventures. In these fun, small, weekend projects, I explored and analyzed various sources of data through a range of machine learning algorithms.

In terms of both complexity and fun, the **Fantasy-Golf-Forecasting** ranks the highest -- check it out!

I created this small portfolio when I was learning the basics of data science. The process helped me acquire the skills needed to land an awesome full-time position as a Data Scientsit with [Fair](http://www.fair.com). As a result, I am currently working on amazing projects; however, they are obviously not available to share publicly.
